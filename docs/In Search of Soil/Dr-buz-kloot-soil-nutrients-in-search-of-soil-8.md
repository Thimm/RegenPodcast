### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 10:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  What if you took a soil test and that test showed that nutrient levels were at value  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  X.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  And then you grew crops in that same soil and you took a soil test later on and that  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:31):**  test revealed that those nutrient levels had increased over the time in which those crops  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  were growing.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  What was responsible for that increase and where did it come from?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  How much of a role did biology play in that?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  That's exactly what my guest today, Dr. Buzz Clute found in a study that he conducted.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  And we found that where we did not apply potassium.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:55):**  Our potassium, the ending soil test potassium values were higher than where we did apply  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  potassium.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  So, we have seen that in many cases, even though you don't apply the recommended nutrient,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  your soil test value actually improves.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  That's Dr. Buzz Clute.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  He's a researcher at the University of South Carolina and it's studies just like this that  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  helped him become a big believer in the importance of biology and healthy soils.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  Today Buzz and I are going to talk about a variety of topics just like this.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  How important is biology?  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  How do you know that that biology is working?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  Meaning soil tests and why you should maybe question or think about soil tests a little  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  differently.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  Let's jump right into the conversation and get talking soil with Dr. Buzz Clute.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:50):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  How would you say your background in chemical engineering has helped you when you moved  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  into the soil space?  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  I think as a chemical engineer, you get trained or any kind of engineer, you get trained to  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  solve problems.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  So that and a background, my main background was more inorganic chemistry, more than organic  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  chemistry.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:17):**  So it was more the background that I had of solving problems more than anything else.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  And I just saw that in soils we had some issues.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  And you may or may not know this, but my undergrad was chemical engineering and my PhD was actually  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  in aquatic sciences.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  And within about five years, I was already thinking about quitting aquatic sciences just  
**[0:02:49-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  because I saw huge problems in water pollution, but no way out of being able to fix those  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  huge problems.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:02):**  My understanding at the time was that soils were the static bodies and that, yeah, it's  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  nice to know about them.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  But it never occurred to me that soils could change.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:16):**  And you probably have heard of this, but that changed when I met Ray Archuleta.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:22):**  I want to think it was about February 2010.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  And in the space of about a morning, he completely changed the way, at least the way I looked  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  at life, I looked at soils.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:37):**  And that changed everything.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  So going back to your question, my background gave me a basic discipline of being able to  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  solve problems.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  But a lot of the static mindset that I brought, I had to actually unlearn.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  It does.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  And do you think that you had an advantage coming in to soils the way you did where you  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  weren't brought up through the university system of learning conventional ag teachings?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  And you might have came through with a mindset of how soils were, but you had that problem  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  solving mindset.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  So you kind of came in, you talked to somebody like Ray, and now it's like, okay, I'm not  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  entrenched into some sort of ideology or thought process.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:22):**  You can adapt where I think one problem a lot of people have, and this isn't a soil  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  thing, this is an every industry thing, is they've been in it so long, it's hard for  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  them to think outside the box, to shift paradigms.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  Did you coming from the outside?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  Do you think that's helped with how you've approached soil science?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  I think that it's a two-edged sword.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  It certainly helps you because you, especially if you don't come from a particular university,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  you're not bowing to the holy writ of the local or the state fertilizer recommendations.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:59):**  Nutrient management was kind of the thing that I kind of got into.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  So you're certainly not beholden to your professors and the leaders in a particular land-grant  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:13):**  university.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  But I think, on the other hand, there's a disadvantage in that I've had to kind of get  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  up to speed on things like plant physiology on my own as well.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  So I think that there's both a disadvantage and advantage.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  And when you dive into the whole thing with both feet, you make a lot of mistakes.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  And I think I've made a lot of mistakes over the last 10 years.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  What's been the biggest mistake that you've made that has really helped you use that as  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:48):**  a stepping stone to evolve knowledge?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  I would probably say the biggest mistake that I've made has been to ignore mineral nutrition.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  Not so much the moron NPK kind of nutrition, you know, just pile hundreds and hundreds  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:13):**  pounds.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  But I've been dismissive about the role of things like micronutrients.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  And I'm only beginning to catch that up.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  So I think it's worked.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  I've been lucky with the farmers that I've worked and given advice.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  I've said, you don't need to apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to grow a crop.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  You don't need to apply as much nitrogen.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  You've got to follow the five principles of soil health.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  But you know, the guys have managed to get through because they were good farmers.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  But I think accelerating the process of regeneration, you've got other people who have done a lot  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  better in terms of beginning to understand things like micronutrients, foliar application  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  of those things and also of compost.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  So again, you know, I threw the baby out with the bathwater and saying, well, you don't  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:20):**  have to apply NPK to grow a crop.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  But I remained somewhat agnostic about some of the very vital roles that were being played  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  in micronutrients.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:33):**  And part of that, you know, is also realizing the impact of things like nitrogenous fertilizers,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  and then a lot of our pesticides and herbicides, like some of the guys from Acres USA called  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  the Devil's Pantry, and some of the harm that they do in sequestering a lot of the essential  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  nutrients we have.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  So we may do a plant tissue test and say, oh, my goodness, we've got all the micronutrients  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  we need.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  And yet those might be sequestered in the plant itself.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  So that's, I think I threw out the baby with the bathwater then.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  So just focusing on the bigger but missing the micro.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:17):**  And I've talked to some people who view micronutrients as they're obviously needed for plant physiology,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  but they are available in the soil if the biology is there to unlock it, be that arbuscular  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microorganisms that can break those down and get those in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  contact with the plant roots.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:43):**  Where do you stand now in terms of the importance of these micronutrients when it comes to plant  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  growth in the soil?  
**[0:08:52-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah, well, first of all, I would put myself firmly in the school of if you're doing the  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  cover crops, you're keeping the soil, you're not disturbing the soil, you've got diversity  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  and then incorporate incorporating livestock, I'm definitely of the opinion that we can  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:15):**  unlock those things.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  So I haven't changed that.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  But I do think that things like micronutrients, and again, I'm still in kindergarten, but  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  I think micronutrients, the judicious use of micronutrients, and even small amounts  
**[0:09:35-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  of other micronutrients in the soil in the in foliar applications, may unlock a lot of  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  the potential of the soil, especially in degraded soil.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  One of the things that become more aware of is the role of calcium that I that I'd never  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  heard about, for instance.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  So that's, I'm trying to experiment with that over here, in part tests and things like that  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  to see, well, if I apply calcium to the soil, how, for instance, would that help my vegetation  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  vegetative growth?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  And those are questions that I'm still working on.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  And I think when some people hear of studies like that, they want to turn to an amendment.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  And there's a huge industry out there that sells stuff to farmers and gardeners to put  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  on the soil.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  And you can just see boxes and boxes of it.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  When it comes to these micronutrients and even macronutrients, do you think it's the  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  problem is us not adding them to the soil?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  Because when people say, well, they're important, they're not in the soil, how do they get there  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  if I don't put them there?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  Where do you stand on that?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  Well, I would imagine there's a balance.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  Let me tell you some of the stories that I've seen over the last five or six years where  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  there's a particular, there are a couple of operations that I've consulted to for the  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  last five, six years.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:13):**  And for instance, and in one of the studies I did, for instance, we did not apply potassium  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:23):**  to a certain set of static plots, 10 static plots.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  We didn't apply potassium for four years, and we took six crops, corn, wheat, soybean  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  crops, so two rotations of that.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:39):**  And we found that where we did not apply potassium, our potassium, the ending soil test potassium  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  values were higher than where we did apply, sorry, not soil, where we did apply fertiliser  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  potassium.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  So we have seen that in many cases, even though you don't apply the recommended nutrient,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  your soil test value actually improves.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  I've seen this on another couple of farms where on the one farm where we haven't applied  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  any phosphorus or potassium for several years, and those values pretty much hold steady.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  They go up and they go down depending on the weather.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:29):**  Where we have applied chicken litter in two years out of three, we've actually seen steady  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  increases in soil test phosphorus.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  Not a surprise, but also things like increases in soil test calcium.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:45):**  So there's no doubt that we have witnessed increases in nutrients sometimes where those  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  nutrients haven't been applied.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  And the thing in common with many of them is that they've had cover crops.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  One of the things I run into often if I say, hey, you know, we haven't put lime on this  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:08):**  place for several years and the pH has stayed steady.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  Then I say, well, we put chicken litter out there two out of three years and immediately,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  you know, folks say, well, that's the thing.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  But where we haven't used chicken litter or lime, we've seen very, very steady values.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  And this is in the work I've done.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  It's been the Malic one, which is sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid double acid extraction.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  So we just haven't seen any change.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  Whereas, you know, five years ago, we were warned that if we didn't apply fertilizers,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  our nutrient stocks would crash.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:52):**  And we haven't seen that.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  It's a pretty interesting study.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  And if you think about that for the average person listening to this, you start with a  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:59):**  plot and you're not adding anything and you've taken a soil test up in front.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  So, you know what the potassium value is in the soil.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:08):**  And then years later, it is increased.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  But you haven't applied potassium.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  Where has the potassium came from?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  Well, I listened to a lovely talk by Richard Mulvaney.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  He was actually talking to, my brain's just gone dead, in a podcast.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:36):**  But basically, you know, the potassium, we've got more potassium in the soil than we know  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  about.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  And so plant roots access that.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  And then of course, your mycorrhizal fungi and all of the biology accesses that.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  And you know, soil soils don't end at six inches.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  They go down into the subsoil.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  And in the coastal plain of South Carolina, you know, with many of our good soils, between  
**[0:15:08-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  eight and 12 inches, we get into a B horizon where you play begins to, you know, your play  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  begins to increase.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  So even though we have one on one clays, with low CECs, we're still seeing quite a lot of  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  potassium.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30):**  So what we know, what we seem to see is that the potassium in the in the rock matrix becomes  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:39):**  available through, we think biology.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:43):**  I'm sure there are other chemical processes.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  But you know, so it goes from the rock matrix inaccessible to what we would call exchangeable  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  to then to soluble.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:01):**  And these are in a dynamic equilibrium.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  And we think that when we add a lot of biology to the system in terms of cover crops, or,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  you know, always having a living root either cover crop or cash crop, we're kind of keeping  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:16):**  that biology going.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  And so we're bringing that calcium from the mineral.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:21):**  And it's being made, not the calcium, the potassium, and the same goes for something  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  like calcium as well.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:32):**  Do you think that one of the things we could be seeing in soils and I haven't heard anybody  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  talk on this, but when you spoke about clays, I started thinking about this.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  Are clays breaking down in soils into some of their more simpler elements?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  So clay is obviously a molecule made up of multiple elements bound together.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:52):**  Is biology breaking some of those bonds?  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  So something where a clay soil, somebody thinks, oh, that can be a disadvantage.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  It's obviously has water holding capacity, which is an advantage.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  But in biology, some of that clay actually changes from clay into some of its more raw  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  elements, which can then become plants available.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  Have you seen that or does that seem possible knowing your chemistry background?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah, that's something that I wouldn't necessarily be totally qualified to talk about.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  But certainly, you know, if you think about weathering, and in South Carolina, we've had  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:33):**  a lot of, you know, for instance, cotton farming, and we lost all of our topsoil.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:40):**  And so in some of the land where we've put back into, you know, woods and forests, and  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  then also in some of the land that was spared, say, in, you know, in where people kept livestock  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  and managed the soils well, you do see that a horizon forming.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  So yes, you know, clay continues to interact or the soil biology continues to interact  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  with the clay.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:11):**  Carbon is added to the system through photosynthesis.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  So you do see a breaking down of that.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  The exact mechanisms, I don't know, but certainly, you know, thinking soil tests in general,  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  if a soil test isn't going to tell you how much phosphates available in your soil, if  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  it's bound up.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  So in some of these systems, you know, you had phosphate increase, but your initial soil  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  tests said you had X and you've increased X to Y over that time.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:40):**  So the soil test missed that.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  And you would have thought, okay, well, I have to add minerals.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  I know you've seen the same thing with other studies, and we can get into that of adding  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:49):**  nitrogen and maybe not having to add the prescribed amounts that a soil test would dictate.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  When you think about what data you're getting from a soil test, considering it doesn't have  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  any sort of biological measures on it, it's really just measuring what is there now.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  Can you actually get valuable information off of that to work with?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  Or is that kind of a flawed test just given what it is measuring?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  And that extends to biology as well, I think.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:23):**  I guess the most valuable thing I can contribute to that, because I used to model water quality,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  and I stole from the water quality modeling people, but I basically have a maxim that  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:35):**  says all soil tests are wrong, some are useful.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  And so first of all, we need to recognize that there are so many different ways of extracting  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  nutrients from the soil.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  So you've got Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3, Morgan, Bray, and the list goes on and on.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  The Haney extraction as well, some of them use harsh acids, some of them use organic  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  acids.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:05):**  The biggest beef that many people have with some of the newer things like Haney is, well,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:11):**  where are the calibrated soil tests?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  The implication being that the other soil tests from many land grant universities are  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  calibrated.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  But if you start comparing, say, Illinois and Indiana, or I think Alabama and Georgia,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  and you just go across the state line, you often see in the nutrient recommendations,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:39):**  if you just cross the state line, that one state might recommend about double the amount  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  of nutrients in terms of cost compared to the other state.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  So the question goes to which is real.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:54):**  And I think the value of any soil test is going to be based on calibrated returns or  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:02):**  calibrated looking at crops growing and how that is calibrated.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  And most of my understanding is certainly in my state, most of the calibrated stuff  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  was done a long time ago.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:18):**  And so we've kind of extrapolated and borrowed from other states.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  So if you don't have the actual data for your soil test and how the plant will respond to  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  a particular treatment, you're kind of just guessing in terms of what response we have.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:40):**  And again, in my state in South Carolina, the soils that we were looking at, based on  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  our land grant university tests, demanded that we put about 100 pounds an acre of potassium  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  or K2O, which is probably close to about 160 pounds of myriad of potash per year.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  Yet we never saw any response to that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  Conventional wisdom was that we were insane and we were going to lose our minds, you know,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  we were going to lose our shirts with that, but we never saw any crop responses.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:19):**  So the way I look at soil tests is usually I like to kind of look at trends over time,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  because what we have seen is that if you stop applying P and K, your soil test values aren't  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  just going to drop through the floor.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  Now we've only done that with cover crops.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  I'm more inclined as I go along to start looking at soil tests that use less harsh extraction  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  methods like the Haney test or some of the Morgan tests.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  But again, I'm not an expert on that.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  Again, a lot of the beef that a lot of people have with the Haney test shows where the data  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  are.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:04):**  But I would also say that, you know, you look across the country and the data we collected  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:10):**  on crop response to nutrient recommendations came from 40, 50, 60 years ago when soils  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  look very different to what they are today.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:19):**  Based upon what you know and you've seen and maybe what you think, do you think in a system  
**[0:23:27-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:27):**  that grows a cash crop, meaning a crop that will be removed off the property, that farmers  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:36):**  could survive going amendment-less, where you are not adding amendments or inputs to  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  the soil and the cash crops don't suffer?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  Now say the amendments you could bring in would be, say, cover crops or maybe that's  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  grazing animals, but you're not putting chemical supplements into the soil.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:59):**  Is amendment-less, input-less farming possible or would it fall back to that kind of conventional  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  wisdom of you're mining your soils and if you don't add, eventually you're going to  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  run out?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  So that's a great question.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  So rule of thumb is 80% of a plant's energy is going to come from the atmosphere.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:23):**  So we think of elements like nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen makes up about 80% of the  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  plant if not more.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  So my answer would be in a, the simple answer would be yes, but the caveat would be that  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  you've got to get your soil to that point.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  You've got to build it up.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  And how is that, because I've heard of this being described by somebody as a perpetual  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  motion machine.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  And one of the things that we keep on, we forget is that the most important energy source  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:07):**  for farms comes from the sun.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  So we're getting, Dwayne Beck once said this and I'll never forget it.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  It was a farmer's job is to harvest sunlight and water.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:24):**  And so as a farmer harvest sunlight and water, so that's going to be the energy, the carbon,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen for that matter in a good system.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  The rest of the mineral energy can come from the soil.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  Now if you've got a system like Gay Brown has, and there are a few guys that are already  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  in that system, and it's not just Gay Brown, it's a lot of guys.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  They are working in a situation where the sunlight harvested is essentially driving  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:05):**  the rest of the system.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  It's just going to be made much easier when you've got diversity, when you've got animals  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  on the farm as well.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  So the short answer is yes, but there are a lot of caveats to that.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  In terms of mining your soil, well, Richard Mulvaney also said, well, I guess you could  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  mine the soil and deplete the soil.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  It's a little bit trying to deplete the salt from the ocean.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:42):**  It's a long term thing, and there's always minerals underneath your A horizon as you  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  go down.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  And again, it's not something I've articulated properly, but that is not a, in the short  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:57):**  to medium term, that is not a concern.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  I think the concern is to return farms to a regenerative future.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  Let's go back to some of your aquatic systems background.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  If you think about aquatic systems, do we have a better understanding of those than  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  we do soil systems?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  When I got my PhD, I think I was still very much, my mindset was in engineering.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  And so it was all about, let's fix this problem.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  You know, okay, well, we've got a problem with polluted water.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  Let's put in a grass strip and a buffer, and that's going to fix the problem.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:37):**  So there was no kind of, okay, well, we've put a diaper, you know, we've put a diaper  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  practice on it, but we never actually found the underlying cause of the problem.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  So we thought, well, runoff is the problem.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  And in fact, you know, runoff is not our problem.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  Infiltration is our problem.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:01):**  So if you have a mindset that says, okay, well, we need to put all of these catch ponds  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  and buffer strips in, you miss the opportunity to say, well, what if we increased infiltration  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  through keeping the soil covered, through keeping alive root in the soil?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  It completely changes your mindset.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  So it's again, a little bit difficult to sort of comment on that on my background.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:29):**  Again, it was just the basic discipline and really kind of the desire to make some sort  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  of positive change in the community.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  I just felt really, really frustrated as an aquatic scientist.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  You know, any kind of improvement was directly dependent on government funding.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  Whereas I think that the opportunity I saw, remember, I'm in a school of public health.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  The opportunity I saw, the biggest bang for the back, I would think is if you got farmers  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  excited about soil health and about regenerating systems.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  So just in the small area of influence I've had, you know, tens of thousands of acres  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  of farmers who have rethought the whole idea of more on fertilizer and started doing cover  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:25):**  crops and things.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  And certainly not just directly to me, farmers trust farmers better.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  So there's that knock on effect.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah, and hopefully podcasts and interviews like this will help get some farmers interested  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  in regeneration.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:41):**  And I share an engineering background with you.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  And I come at it from a problem solving mindset.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  Yet I think a lot of when you look at soils, it's not really what can I do to solve this  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  problem.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  A lot of times it's what can I not do.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  And you go back to more of a natural system.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  And you have, you know, the five principles of soil health.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  Can you run through those?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  Because I think those are problem solving steps that people can use to turn soil.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:11):**  But it's not add this, do more of this, do more of this.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  It is a lot of backing off a little bit and letting nature more take the reins.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:21):**  Well we need to distinguish between practices and principles.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  So practice would be cover crop.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:30):**  A practice might be, you know, no till.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  Or a practice might be a certain kind of tillage.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  Or even, you know, livestock fencing.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  So practices are the details that we can implement, you know, once we understand the system.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:50):**  The five principles of soil health as I learned them was number one, keep disturbance to a  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  minimum.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:00):**  That's minimum physical, chemical, and biological disturbance.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  And keep in mind that farming is nothing other than managing disturbance.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  Because when we plant a corn crop in the ground of what was formerly prairie land, you know,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  we are disturbing system.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:19):**  But we're trying to keep that disturbance to a minimum.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  So first is keeping, sorry, minimum disturbance.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  Keeping the soil covered either with a layer of residue or a living canopy.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  Third one is, sorry, keep a live root in the soil year round.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  So that's again related to having a canopy up there.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  But if you're keeping live roots in the soil year round, you have a way of, or as many  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:58):**  days of the year as possible, you have a way of harvesting sunlight.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  And indeed water because I think, you know, your infiltration rates increase, especially  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  around the plant and the plant roots.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  But the plant harvests the sunlight and then feeds the soil microbes.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  So keep the soil, minimum disturbance, keep the soil covered, keep a live root.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:22):**  The fourth one is diversity, diversity, diversity.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  So this is starting to diversify not only through crop rotations, but add a lot of diversity  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  through multi species cover crops.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:39):**  So you know, if you did corn and soybeans, but you had, you know, 10 species in your  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  cover crop, all of a sudden you're going from two species every two years to 12 species  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:52):**  every two years.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:54):**  You throw a warm season cover crop in there and all of a sudden you're going up to 20  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:59):**  species.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  And then the fifth one, and which a lot of people argue is part B of the fourth principle  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  of diversity is integrate livestock back into your system because our systems really were  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:15):**  never designed to work without livestock.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  So you know, there's a lot more of an emphasis there.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  And we see that as a rule of thumb, I think guys who incorporate livestock back into their  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  cropping systems are seeing bigger improvements.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  So just going back up because a lot of commentary, minimum disturbance, keep the soil covered,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:42):**  keep a live root in the soil, diversity, diversity, diversity, and then keep livestock in the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:48):**  corn system.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  Is there one of those that you think that if farmers started to do more of that, they  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:58):**  would see a huge change?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  I get they're five, they're all interconnected, they're all important, but is there one on  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  that list that they could potentially have more of a leverage effect to it?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  Well actually, when we talk about keep alive, keep the soil covered with a canopy, keep  
**[0:34:19-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  a live root in the soil and diversity, diversity, diversity, multi-species cover crops actually  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  really tick the check the boxes for all three.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:30):**  So we have seen farmers be transformed in the way they think by multi-species cover  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  crops.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  So it captures their imagination, they can go in and see with their own eyes what those  
**[0:34:45-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  multi-species cover crops do, either in the reducing of inputs or in the coastal plan  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  of South Carolina.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  A lot of the farmers that I know never saw earthworms in their field.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  And within about a year or so after having cover crops, many guys come in and saying,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  where did the earthworms come from?  
**[0:35:09-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  So to answer your question, the one practice that covers the three principles would be  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  multi-species cover crops.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:20):**  That's certainly what I've seen.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  I think farmers like that feedback.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  It's very visual and you can also feel it, the soil underground and you can smell it,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:34):**  you can pick that soil and it smells like a forest floor.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  So I would say that's where you'd probably want to start is those multi-species cover  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  crops.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  Do you have any case studies or farms that you visited throughout the years that you  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  could kind of walk through an iteration of they weren't using the practice of multi-species  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  cover cropping to now they are and these are some of the changes that they saw?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  Just to put a little bit of numbers behind it.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  Yes, I actually have two case studies.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  Do you want me to talk about them now?  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  Yeah, I'll do it.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  Well, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but let's go for the simpler one is a  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  guy called Jason Carter who lives close to Columbia, South Carolina.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:30):**  He started his first cover crop about seven or eight years ago and the second year that  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  he and the first year he did his multi-species cover crop, he got so frightened of the biomass,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:46):**  he terminated it in February.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  So in South Carolina, you know, things started to green up.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  But when his cover crop got to, I think, knee high, he really kind of got worried about  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:02):**  planting into that.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  Jason farms in a coastal plain soil and he and I started a, he was one of five farmers,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  I started a conservation innovation grant, a USDA grant with, and so he gave me 15 acres  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  along with four other farmers to look at.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:31):**  And the idea over three years was that we would put multi-species cover crops in.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  And what we noticed was he had basically a corn-soybean rotation and we put cool season  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:47):**  cover crops in.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:48):**  I think four species or basically four was rye, hairy vetch, crimson clover and daikon  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:57):**  radish.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  So when he harvested his corn, he would then plant that cover crop.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:03):**  When he harvested his soybeans, he would do the same.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  Possibly the most important number that we have found there was that his organic matter  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:13):**  on that particular field went up from, went up about 60 to 70 percent.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:21):**  So the numbers I'm remembering are about from 0.9 percent to 1.6 percent.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  So that was on a sandy coastal plain soil.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  One of the other things that in that experiment that we noticed was that at the end of the  
**[0:38:44-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:44):**  first growing season when we went back to do our soil tests, we noticed that Jason,  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  the soil test phosphorescent potassium that I was assured would drop like a stone, we  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:01):**  noticed that the soil test phosphorescent potassium were almost identical to what they  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  were at the beginning of the growth or the previous year.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  So I went to my five farmers.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:15):**  They each had gave me 10 to 15 acres and I said, how about we just don't fertilize this  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  year?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  So they trusted me.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:25):**  I don't know why they trusted me.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:27):**  They did.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:29):**  And this happened on all the other guys' farms.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  But Jason hasn't had, he hasn't added phosphorus or potassium on this sandy coastal plain soil  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  for seven years.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:45):**  And we still see steady phosphorus and potassium soil test values.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  Our organic matter has increased and our soil test pH has actually increased.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:04):**  So his soil test pH is about 6.5 and 6.6.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  And typically he was adding lime every second year.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:15):**  So just on those inputs, Jason has saved a lot of money.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:20):**  He still, with his cover crop, and then he also adds manure every second year when he  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  grows corn.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  He puts 50 units of nitrogen on and when it rains, well, he gets 150 bushels of corn.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  So conventional wisdom says to get 150 bushels of corn over here in this state, you have  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  to add 150 plus another 20 pounds of nitrogen to the soil.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:55):**  And we just haven't seen that.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  So Jason's yields have stayed the same or they may be improving, but his input costs  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  have gone down.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  His soil test values remain static on the P and K. And his calcium, not calcium, his  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:14):**  pH has stabilized as well.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  Pretty amazing benefits just from putting in some cover crops.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  Right, right.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  Well, you know, and someone would argue, well, what if we didn't put any cover crops?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  And I'd say, yeah, I think, you know, that's really worth an experiment.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  But imagine what the implications would be is then does that mean the soil science of  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  all those previous years was wrong in any case?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  So we attribute those stabilizing to cover cropping and certainly adding the chicken  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  litter every second year, I would also imagine helps.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  He puts one to two tons a year every second year on.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:00):**  What is the potential cons to cover cropping?  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  Because there's got to be people who are saying like, I'm just not going to do that.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  Is it the worry that they're going to spend the money on the seed and not get the return  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  on the money?  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:12):**  Like, is there a risk of doing it?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:15):**  And why wouldn't you do it, I guess is what I'm asking.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  Let me just add one other thing on Jason's thing.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:23):**  And then let's circle back to that question is we have noticed infiltration increases.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  And so whenever we have a five inch rainstorm, the water runs off from his neighbors and  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  basically infiltrates into his land.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  So every drop of rain that Jason gets essentially stays on his farm.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:46):**  Now when we get excess runoff, that is a problem.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  But that's also got to do with everything that's upland.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:56):**  But when you have a raindrop, even a one to two inch storm on his property, it's going  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  to sink straight in.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  Okay, so circling back, can you just ask that question again?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:11):**  People hear that all the benefits of cover crops is pretty amazing.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  It almost feels like a free lunch in a way.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:19):**  What yet not everybody's doing cover crops.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  What are some of the reasons you hear farmers say I'm not going to do it?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  Is it the worry I'm going to spend the money on the seed, spend the time, plan it and I'm  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  not going to get the return?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  Okay.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  Well, the funny answer, the funny and silly answer is that you lose tractor tires because  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:38):**  you have a lot of deer antlers in the field.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:41):**  So your tractor tire consumption does go up.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  One of the objections is that this is just an added cost.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  And then there's no thought given to some of those benefits because I think farmers  
**[0:43:58-0:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  have been inculcated to believing that if you cut back on any kind of chemical inputs,  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:08):**  you're going to have a disaster on your hand.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:11):**  So if you're a farmer and you're not penciling in a profit and then you're being told by  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  somebody with a funny accent like me that cover crops are going to help you, you're  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:26):**  saying the guy's lost his nuts, he's lost his marbles because he's asking me to spend  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  $30 on seed, an acre on seed and then I still got to drill it in.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  And then what do I do in terms of terminating the cover crop and planting into it?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  So it would be the added expense.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  I think the other concern many farmers have had and it's been met with so much YouTube  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  stuff is how do I plant into 10,000 pounds of residue?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  Because when that cover crop, warm season cover crop, cool season cover crop gets up  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  to about shoulder height, you know you've got about 10 or even 18,000 pounds, dry pounds  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:14):**  per acre of residue.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  How do you plant into that?  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  So there are a lot of guys who plant in green, some of them terminate and so there's a lot  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  of back and forth on that.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  But planting into it is another problem.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  I think farmers are also told that you get green bridging and I don't disagree with this,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  is that sometimes you get pest carryover.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  So for instance, there may be certain cover crop species that are hosts to nematodes for  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  example and they will carry those across.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  I'm not an expert on that so there's only anecdotal evidence that I have.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  But you know I've seen in some cases that where we had a crimson clover, we did see  
**[0:46:13-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  in the following corn crop, we did see spiral nematodes in our field.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  But I went to another farm that had an active growing crimson clover cover crop and I looked  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:27):**  there and I didn't find any.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:29):**  So you know the juries, as far as I'm concerned, the jury's out.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  But again I think I've had to learn that I shouldn't be dismissive and you know my stance  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  was always, you know if you've got multi-species cover crops out there, nature is going to  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  take care of herself and I don't think that's always the case.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:53):**  I think we've got to be very intelligent about choosing cover crops.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:57):**  But I'm not always sure exactly where that goes.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:03):**  I often trust what the farmers I work with see, you know what they see and then I kind  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  of try and confirm, you know try and collect evidence that either confirms or refutes a  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:16):**  particular hypothesis that they have.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  But if you go back it's going to be that added expense and how do I plant into that and then  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  the disease.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:27):**  Yeah because if you adhere to your base principle number one, that's no tillage or minimum  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  disturbance, you got to do a roller crimp, it's got to just die off seasonally and then  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  you are left with all that residue which I guess also mimics principle number five.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  I mean that is essentially the animal grazing.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:46):**  I get you're missing the urine, the dung, all the other microbes that the animals bring  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  but at least you're getting the quote, you know, trample that a livestock would bring  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  only you're bringing it in with diesel fuel.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:58):**  Yeah, I'm not sure if I agree with you on that fifth principle but yeah, you know I  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  think most of the farmers I work with still work with herbicides.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:10):**  So you know they're going to go over it and terminate that.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  I think the holy grail for many of us is how are we going to be able to terminate our cover  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  crops without herbicides and especially when you've got multi species cover crops with  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  different maturation dates.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  So but there is, I don't know if you've ever heard of a Phillips Harrow.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  There are a few of the farmers that I work with that want to save their grain drills  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:44):**  so they go ahead and spread their cover crop out.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  You know usually it's a 30 to 40 foot pattern and they run over it with the Phillips Harrow  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  and so this is on a crop that's been harvested and that looks like a herd of bison have just  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:01):**  gone over it.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  So Phillips Harrow, I don't know if you've ever seen one of them, but it doesn't actually  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  penetrate the soil but you'd have to look it up because I'm going to not be able to  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:20):**  describe it but when you pull it along you can pull it along at 10 miles an hour and  
**[0:49:26-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  you could have Phillips Harrows between 30 and 40 foot wide and they just disturb the  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  surface of the soil and they tend to give you the seed to soil contact.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:40):**  In that case the process of planting the cover crop may to some extent emulate hoof action  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:48):**  of animals.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  Yeah and looking at one for people listening it almost looks like a spiked rod, a rod with  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  a bunch of spikes, almost like a roll brush that somebody would use to brush out their  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  hair, a cylindrical tube, a bunch of rods sticking out that rolls, pokes the soil.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  What I found with farmers who have sort of committed wholeheartedly to cover crops, I've  
**[0:50:15-0:50:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  got a farmer who has 6000 acres and so he's got 1700 acres usually in the fall or usually

**[0:52:40-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  like chelating a lot of the essential minerals that we have.

**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  I also hear of anecdotal evidence that pest pressure now is way higher than it used to  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  be.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  It makes me think that gradually we have become used to systems that are so full of pesticides  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  and plants that are extremely unhealthy.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  So they're very unhealthy so what do we have to do?  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  Well they're attacked by pests.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  What do we have to do?  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  We have to spray them.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  What does that do that lowers the photosynthetic activity in the plant which makes it more  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:59):**  susceptible to pest species.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  So I think we're in kind of a downward spiral there.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  So again going back I don't have comparative numbers so I couldn't speak authoritatively  
**[0:54:17-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:17):**  on that but I have a suspicion that our production agriculture system has moved us to more and  
**[0:54:27-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  more unhealthy soils and I don't know whether certain kinds of tillage systems and I know  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  this is sacrilege to my soil health brothers and sisters but you know are they tillage  
**[0:54:40-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  systems that may be less destructive than some of the herbicides that we're using.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  So it's a question that I would have been absolutely on the side.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:52):**  No we need to use herbicides because tillage is extremely damaging.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:57):**  Now I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but I think there are unintended consequences  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  when we use herbicides and pesticides.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08):**  Do you think tillage should be more measured on a curve?  
**[0:55:12-0:55:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:12):**  I hear a lot about no-till and one of the biggest gripes about no-till is people see  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  small things like even maybe that Phillips Harrow and they'll say well that's tillage.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:24):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:26):**  Well that's just not a hard definition and maybe you know obviously one if I till one  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:32):**  inch into the soil that's going to be less destructive than if I mold board plow it 12  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  inches deep and really invert the soil.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:41):**  So is there a curve of quote damage when it comes to tillage?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  Right.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:47):**  I'm a complete agnostic on tillage.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  I wouldn't be able to answer that.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:52):**  Again I heard on one of the John Kempf podcasts I wish I knew the name of the guy but he was  
**[0:55:58-0:56:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:58):**  talking about certain kinds of tillage being worse than others and one of the things that  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:06):**  surprised me was he said you know when you've got tines that sort of tillage is less destructive  
**[0:56:11-0:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:11):**  than when you've got something like a disk system.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:19):**  But again I'm a complete agnostic on tillage so I wouldn't be able to really tell you although  
**[0:56:27-0:56:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  you know instinctively you know the moldboard plow if you're plowing stuff that might have  
**[0:56:34-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:34):**  been if you're body plowing and you're bringing it up I've seen guys that have done that and  
**[0:56:41-0:56:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  their soils in this part are terrible.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:43):**  You know they're bringing in sandy systems they're bringing that clay to the surface  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  and when they bring the clay to the surface and it's left fallow for you know a few weeks  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  in the baking sun guess what happens to that clay it turns into pottery.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:59):**  So they've got pottery on their land.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:02):**  So I'm not a big fan of tillage but I'm beginning to be a little bit worried about some of these  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:12):**  herbicides that we're using and I don't know what that solution is.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:17):**  So ideally like you said the holy grail is a way to terminate cover crops, no tillage,  
**[0:57:23-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  no sprays.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  Yeah and when you do that you're going to have to be judicious.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  You know the best way to do that would be to find a cover crop that terminates easily  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  and probably you know the best way you know I've been speaking to some organic hemp guys  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:41):**  and you know that they were really interested in soil health but their multi species cover  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:46):**  crop you know the rye might have died but the hairy batch carried on growing.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:51):**  So you know if we're going to do this well we would probably have to select a species,  
**[0:57:57-0:58:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:57):**  make sure it matures on time and then when we mechanically terminate it, it all terminates  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:04):**  at the same time.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  So it is a holy grail.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:07):**  I think Rodale Institute probably has a lot of research on that where they till every  
**[0:58:15-0:58:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:15):**  third year for perennial weed species.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:19):**  What about this, given your growing apprehension around chemical sprays, herbicides, given  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:28):**  the reluctance to till, is planting a single species cover crop that terminates easily  
**[0:58:35-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:35):**  mechanically better than multi species cover cropping that you don't know how to terminate  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  and get your next crop in?  
**[0:58:44-0:58:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:45):**  I don't know, I think I've probably got livestock supporters if they're listening, you know  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:52):**  they're going to say, you idiot, it's livestock.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  When you bring livestock into your system, I think livestock often is going to help fix  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:08):**  a lot of those problems because livestock love things like Palmer amaranth as long as  
**[0:59:16-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  it's not too big.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  To answer you, in terms of one system or the other, I just don't know.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:24):**  I just don't know.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:27):**  But I suspect that if we're going to move this forward, we're going to have to think  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:31):**  about adding that livestock component.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  What about in terms of the P and the K in the system?  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:40):**  In a cover cropping system, you've gone through a couple case studies where the levels are  
**[0:59:45-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:45):**  staying the same.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  They're not dropping and we're not adding P and K into the system externally.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:53):**  The plants obviously need them biologically to perform.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:56):**  Can you walk through the cycle of what is happening with that P and K in the soil that  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  it's being used by the plant when the plant needs it, when the plant's growing?  
**[1:00:07-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  The plant dies.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  The P and the K aren't just going up to the sky and going away.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:13):**  They're ending up back in the soil because if those measurements are staying the same  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:17):**  or increasing, we're concentrating them in the soil.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  How is the plant using them and then getting them back into the soil where those levels  
**[1:00:25-1:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:25):**  stay the same or increase?  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:26):**  Okay, yeah.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  And let me just add, this is only my experience in coastal plain soils.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  For instance, in the one thing where we were looking at the potassium concentrations, we  
**[1:00:41-1:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:41):**  did notice slow drops of soil test phosphorus over time, but we never saw phosphorus deficiencies.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:50):**  Again, I think this goes back to get to your question.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  I think this just goes back to harvesting sunlight.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  When we're harvesting sunlight with a cover crop, we then are accessing mineral nutrients  
**[1:01:07-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  in the soil through root exudates and then through interactions with soil microbes.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  Those mineral nutrients were not there or were not available in the past.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  The cover crop then grows up, it dies, and then some of those nutrients are passed on.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:29):**  Potassium for instance is always in the inorganic form, and it goes back into the soil before  
**[1:01:34-1:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  the plant dies or it actually just leaches out of the plant in the soil.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  So there are again many different methods.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:43):**  But you also talk about the removal of things like nitrogen or at least phosphorus from  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:53):**  the system through grain removal.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  So we're seeing that removal, but we're seeing slow decreases in soil test P, but we haven't  
**[1:02:08-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:08):**  yet seen in our situation soil test P deficiencies.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  I know a few guys in North Dakota who haven't had added synthetics for over 20 years, their  
**[1:02:23-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  soil test values in that particular, especially something like P, have gone down to places  
**[1:02:31-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:31):**  that would scare the dickens out of agronomists.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  But their plant tissue P is just fine.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:39):**  And so I think we're seeing much more in nature, much more of a just in time system where the  
**[1:02:47-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:47):**  P is mobilized when it's needed from the minerals in the soil.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  And the only way you can mobilize that is through improving your soil biology.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:58):**  Do you think the idea of looking at plant tissues is something maybe more farmers should  
**[1:03:02-1:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  embrace to see what's actually in the plants when they're growing that whole just in time  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:07):**  system if it's pulling?  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:09):**  Your soil test may not show it, but the plants definitely going to show it when it's mid  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:13):**  growth and then you're going to know, am I short on it?  
**[1:03:15-1:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:15):**  Do I have it?  
**[1:03:17-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  Maybe I'm all good.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:18):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:19):**  A year ago, I would have said absolutely yes, because this is how I've weaned to some of  
**[1:03:27-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  the farmers that I work with on fertilizer because we went in and we found, for instance,  
**[1:03:36-1:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  I think in sort of 2015 to 2017, where we stopped applying phosphorus fertilizer, we  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:44):**  had two out of 500 deficiencies in phosphorus.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  And that was on corn in the early part of the season.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  We went back the next week and those deficiencies were no longer there.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  We did the same with potassium, where we found that plant potassium was up and down, not  
**[1:04:06-1:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:06):**  based on what the supply was, but was based more on what the weather was.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:13):**  So I think it's a good report card.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:16):**  But what I've become more aware of more recently is that a plant may experience a particular  
**[1:04:24-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  deficiency or you might see those symptoms of a particular deficiency in the plant leaves  
**[1:04:32-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:32):**  or roots, but the plant tissue test comes back just fine.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  And what I'm to understand is that some of the minerals in that plant tissue may be chelated  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  inside the plant tissue itself.  
**[1:04:49-1:05:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:49):**  So therefore, while it's inside the plant tissue, it may not be available to that system.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:00):**  I think plant tissue tests are of limited use in terms of maybe weaning ourselves off  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:10):**  some of the high input numbers that we're used to.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:15):**  But the newer sort of buzzword, and I haven't done any of this, is looking at plant SAP  
**[1:05:22-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  analysis rather than the plant tissue analysis and beginning to take a deeper dive in those  
**[1:05:29-1:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  especially maybe looking at a differential between your newer growth and your older growth.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:37):**  So I think these are useful going back.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:42):**  Plant tissue tests are probably useful, especially in your gross macronutrients, to kind of reassure  
**[1:05:50-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  you that you're not sort of hurting yourself when you grow your crops.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:00):**  But probably plant SAP analysis may be a little bit more precise.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  With the row crop farming guys that I work with, probably in the final analysis, it's  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  maybe the farmer's eyes that tell us the most.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:18):**  In the past, I've said, don't worry, it'll all work itself out.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:24):**  And I think more and more I need to start trying to understand maybe some of the visuals  
**[1:06:29-1:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:29):**  that we're seeing in crops and being able to say, well, that does look like a boron  
**[1:06:34-1:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:34):**  deficiency.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:35):**  Let's use some kind of foliar fertilization.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:39):**  How do you see foliar fertilization fitting in to this?  
**[1:06:43-1:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  If the soils are healthy, working, that mineral pump is going, powered by the sun, where does  
**[1:06:51-1:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:51):**  foliar feeding come in?  
**[1:06:52-1:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:52):**  Are you just doing what now you used to do to the soil where you used to just add stuff  
**[1:06:59-1:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:59):**  to the soil?  
**[1:07:00-1:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  Now we're going to put it on the plant instead?  
**[1:07:01-1:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:01):**  Right, right.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:03):**  Well, remember your foliar fertilization, you're using orders of magnitude less.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:11):**  And it's less about the NPK that you're putting out there.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  It's probably going to focus on some of the micronutrients and a little bit of phosphorus  
**[1:07:20-1:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:20):**  and small amounts of nitrogen.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:21):**  But what I understand about foliar fertilization is that your uptake in the plant is much higher.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:30):**  So the advantage might be that you can supplement the nutrients in a crop and the supplementing  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:42):**  of those nutrients in a crop in a system that might still be on its way to getting better  
**[1:07:48-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:48):**  would be useful and profitable.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  I don't know how useful and profitable it would be in row crops where commodity prices  
**[1:07:58-1:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:58):**  are really awful right now.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:01):**  So I think theoretically we can address some nutrient shortfalls through foliar spraying,  
**[1:08:10-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:10):**  but I think the question is, you know, is there a benefit, especially when commodity  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  prices are terrible?  
**[1:08:19-1:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  With your chemistry background, what might be the benefits of foliar feeding over root  
**[1:08:27-1:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:27):**  feeding?  
**[1:08:28-1:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:28):**  Part of me is saying, well, the roots are designed to uptake nutrients.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:32):**  Why am I not soil drenching these micronutrients versus foliar feeding them through a leaf,  
**[1:08:39-1:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:39):**  which has some ability to take in nutrients, but it can't be as effective as a root or  
**[1:08:44-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:44):**  is it as effective?  
**[1:08:46-1:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[1:08:47-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:47):**  What do you know on that?  
**[1:08:48-1:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  What your intuition tell you?  
**[1:08:50-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:50):**  Well, again, foliar feeding very, very much smaller amounts.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  But the uptake in the plant leaves can be much quicker.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:05):**  So foliar feeding may more be in the line of correcting over time.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:11):**  But I have to say I'm still really in kindergarten to be able to really address this.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:17):**  I think foliar feeding also probably, you know, you're going to have to do it every  
**[1:09:21-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:21):**  10 to 14 days.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  So go back and back and back.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:25):**  And that's where I think the profitability or the cost benefit analysis has to be looked  
**[1:09:30-1:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:30):**  at.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:31):**  But again, you know, this is only something I've entertained sort of since the beginning  
**[1:09:36-1:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:36):**  of this year.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:38):**  So I'm definite, you know, you'll have to ask other people who understand foliar feeding  
**[1:09:44-1:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:44):**  a lot better than me.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  If we go back to those five base principles, minimize soil disturbance, keep a cover, keep  
**[1:09:54-1:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:54):**  a root in the ground.  
**[1:09:57-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:57):**  If it was possible with a row crop, and a lot of people listening to this, they're not  
**[1:10:01-1:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  necessarily growing row crops.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:02):**  I know you have a lot of experience with row crops.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:04):**  They're growing smaller crops of vegetables.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  Do you see a system where if I could grow a perennial type cover crop, keep that in  
**[1:10:14-1:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  the soil all the time and grow that alongside of my cash crop, that that is kind of your  
**[1:10:21-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:21):**  dream system where there's maybe not 365 all year round, depending on where you live, but  
**[1:10:29-1:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  for the majority of the year, you have that cover crop in there, you have the cash crop  
**[1:10:32-1:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:32):**  in there.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:33):**  They're both growing symbiotically.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:35):**  And the cover crop, you're not necessarily worried about terminating it.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:38):**  You're just more worried about keeping it alive so that carbon pump is working and the  
**[1:10:42-1:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  microbes are feeding off of it.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:44):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:45):**  I know of at least one instance where that in fact happens, there's a few guys in Georgia,  
**[1:10:54-1:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  one guy I specifically met, and he had a crimson clover cover crop.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  And I think he's added a little bit of white clover in that.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:04):**  And he essentially stripped hills into that crimson clover.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  And his corn and cotton then come up in that strip.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  And by the time the strip closes with the clover cover crop, his crop is well on its  
**[1:11:21-1:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:21):**  way.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:22):**  So I think those systems are definitely something one should aim for.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  I think Elaine Ingham was doing some work with a bunch of different people on looking  
**[1:11:39-1:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:39):**  at natural ground creeping cover, natural plants like pony's foot that typically sat  
**[1:11:48-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:48):**  on the ground and covered the ground and then putting cash crops in between those.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  So that certainly is another way to do it.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  If you're not spending money on cover crops, how cruel would that be?  
**[1:12:05-1:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:05):**  What about nature's cover crops?  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:07):**  What about weeds?  
**[1:12:09-1:12:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:09):**  There is this huge idea in ag that weeds are bad.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:14):**  They don't fit into the system.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  And if you have low growing weeds, like a purslane or something like that that's at  
**[1:12:22-1:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:22):**  the low and you're growing corn where you're harvesting way above it, do you see any sort  
**[1:12:28-1:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:28):**  of competition or is that a wrong that is just kind of came up through ag where those  
**[1:12:35-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  weeds need to be removed because they're not stealing nutrients away from the crop and  
**[1:12:39-1:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:39):**  maybe they're making the system better.  
**[1:12:41-1:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:41):**  What are your thoughts on weeds coexisting with cash crops?  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:45):**  Have you ever seen this book, Managing Weeds Without Poisons by Charles Walters?  
**[1:12:51-1:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:51):**  I think I've heard of that one.  
**[1:12:53-1:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:53):**  I have not read that one.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  I think he's the founder of Acres USA.  
**[1:12:59-1:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:59):**  And then of course he refers to other things.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:02):**  And really what Charles Walters says is that weeds tell us about, they speak to us about  
**[1:13:09-1:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  what's happening in the soil.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:11):**  So going back to your question about purslane, something that would be a ground, a natural  
**[1:13:18-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:18):**  ground cover theoretically in between corn, I don't see would be a problem.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  I think it's a question of us learning how to understand weeds again or weedy species  
**[1:13:30-1:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:30):**  and they're there typically as a symptom of what's happening in the soil.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:39):**  I don't know that we should be just leaving weedy species out there if we're say doing  
**[1:13:47-1:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  row crops.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:48):**  But I think the definition of a weed is a plant out of place was something that allowed  
**[1:13:58-1:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  the development of chemicals or not allowed, but justified the development of chemicals.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  And I think the better we understand weedy species and what they're telling us, the better  
**[1:14:11-1:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:11):**  we're going to be able to manage them.  
**[1:14:14-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:14):**  Again if we have cows, that's not a problem.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  I would be hesitant to tell my row crop farmers just to leave the weeds going.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:23):**  One of the things that we have in the southeast would be henbit and chickweed, which are not  
**[1:14:29-1:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  very, so there's a big argument, oh, just let the henbit and chickweed grow.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:36):**  And we can terminate that.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:38):**  And when you terminate those, there's basically nothing left.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:42):**  They just meld into the soil.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  I'm not a great fan of them because they don't provide that much biomass and they don't provide  
**[1:14:53-1:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:53):**  much ground cover either.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:56):**  But I would not rule out being able to look at some of the natural quote unquote weedy  
**[1:15:02-1:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  species that we have and see how do we fit those into our systems.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:10):**  And I've tended to be maybe a little bit narrow minded on your conventional cover crop species  
**[1:15:18-1:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:18):**  without going into say what someone like Charles Walters has been talking about 50 years ago.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:24):**  And you have that book by Charles and I think some people look at that with an ag and they  
**[1:15:29-1:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:29):**  say that's pseudoscience, it's a bit woo woo.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:33):**  What's the current feeling or understanding in academia from your perspective of weeds?  
**[1:15:40-1:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:40):**  Are they a plant out of place or do we have any sense of when weeds show up, this is why  
**[1:15:47-1:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:47):**  this particular weed is here?  
**[1:15:50-1:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:51):**  Well, keep in mind, I'm not from an agricultural school.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:56):**  I'm from a school of public health, so I come at it from a slightly different angle.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:00):**  I'm also not an ecologist, but if we had a more ecological understanding of weeds, I

**[1:16:44-1:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:44):**  I think a lot of it, again, this is just my thinking, a lot of it is just basically driven

**[1:16:52-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  You don't sell product if you say, well, let's figure out how we can work with mother nature,  
**[1:17:02-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  what plants are going to work with us and how does this work?  
**[1:17:06-1:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  It just doesn't sell product.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  That goes to herbicides, pesticides, chemicals.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:14):**  I'm not anti the use of fertilizers and things like that, but I think the scientific questions  
**[1:17:26-1:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:26):**  that have been asked often are skewed towards what would make the industry more money.  
**[1:17:37-1:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:37):**  If you observed anything anecdotally from maybe farms you visited, Gabe Brown, some

**[1:17:52-1:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:52):**  they've really built up healthy soils.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:54):**  Have you ever seen a correlation where you could say, this soil looks better, it looks

**[1:18:02-1:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:18:04-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:04):**  We see that all the time.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:06):**  I've been fortunate in that I work in South Carolina, South Dakota.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:13):**  I've been to Idaho, Colorado.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:19):**  So number one, it's much easier for me to see and to touch and to smell and to say whether  
**[1:18:30-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:30):**  soil is healthy or not.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  And so you've got people like Brendan Rocky, for instance, who is in Colorado and he farms  
**[1:18:39-1:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:39):**  potatoes, but he doesn't only farm potatoes.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:42):**  He will rotate that out every three years with quinoa.  
**[1:18:47-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47):**  But not only that, he also has a cover crop that he grazes and not only that, he's going  
**[1:18:53-1:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  to put companion crops in it.  
**[1:18:56-1:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:56):**  And so, you know, Brendan doesn't really have much of a weed problem.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:01):**  You know, he probably does.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  He does elect to use herbicides if he needs to.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:07):**  But in his system, weeds are less of a problem.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:11):**  The guys in the southeast that I work with, that's in South Carolina and then North Carolina  
**[1:19:19-1:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:19):**  and Georgia, the guys who've been cover cropping and have been experienced in this a long time.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:25):**  Palmer amaranth, which is just a huge problem in conventional fields.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:31):**  Palmer amaranth is just not a problem to these guys.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:34):**  Jason Carter, I think, usually now he handweeds most of his fields of Palmer amaranth.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:42):**  So the answer is yes, you can actually see in long term systems or not even long term  
**[1:19:48-1:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:48):**  systems, but systems where you just start keeping the soil covered, your cover crops  
**[1:19:53-1:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:53):**  are going to outcompete a lot of the weeds that were absolutely pests in your system.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:59):**  Do you think it's a now competition or do you think it's the biology has fixed the mineralogy  
**[1:20:06-1:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  and the weeds aren't trying to rectify a problem because the problem isn't there if we believe  
**[1:20:14-1:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:14):**  this concept that weeds heal specific things in the soil?  
**[1:20:19-1:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:19):**  Yeah, the answer is yes.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:23):**  There's both competition, but there's also evidence that in soils that become more and  
**[1:20:29-1:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:29):**  more healthy.  
**[1:20:32-1:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:32):**  Remember for the most part, weedy species, Elaine Ingham has talked about a much more  
**[1:20:40-1:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:40):**  helpful definition rather than a plant out of place.  
**[1:20:44-1:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:44):**  These species are going to be typically small early successional plants that grow very quickly,  
**[1:20:54-1:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:54):**  produce a lot of seeds and then die.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:57):**  So their interest, if you would want to use that word, is not in generating these mycorrhizal  
**[1:21:06-1:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:06):**  relationships that are usually a characteristic of later successional plants and perennials.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:14):**  Their interest is in growing really, really, really quickly and then producing seed and  
**[1:21:20-1:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:20):**  getting out for the next cycle.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:23):**  And what happens is when you get more and more soil structure, more and more mycorrhizal,  
**[1:21:30-1:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  higher fungal to bacterial ratios is that the seed no longer is stimulated to actually  
**[1:21:41-1:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:41):**  germinate.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  And so it will only germinate if the soil gets disturbed or compressed or compacted  
**[1:21:49-1:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  or waterlogged or something like that.  
**[1:21:51-1:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:51):**  So I think soil condition, not only in terms of your fungal to bacterial or your microbial  
**[1:21:59-1:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:59):**  relationships, but I think there's also evidence that, for instance, soil that have very, very  
**[1:22:06-1:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:06):**  high soluble calciums really disfavoured the growth of weedy species.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:13):**  Yeah, it's really interesting.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  Pardon me?  
**[1:22:16-1:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:16):**  I was just going to say, it's really interesting when you think about that whole succession  
**[1:22:19-1:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:19):**  and all the interconnected relationships between the mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[1:22:25-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:25):**  And I was talking to someone else and they were looking at weeds saying they might not  
**[1:22:30-1:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:30):**  form those relationships with mycorrhizal fungi under the soil, but a lot of weedy species  
**[1:22:35-1:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:35):**  might form fungal relationships on their leaves because they're early inhibitors or they're  
**[1:22:40-1:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:40):**  more picking up those types of nutrients.  
**[1:22:43-1:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:43):**  That's interesting.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:44):**  Yeah, I've never heard of that.  
**[1:22:46-1:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:46):**  Yeah, you know, I've got some pigweed in my strawberry patch, which is very fungal, but  
**[1:22:52-1:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:52):**  the pigweed is kind of really pathetic looking.  
**[1:22:55-1:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:55):**  You know, I don't know if it's going to set seed or anything.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:58):**  So yeah, so but, you know, I think it's in terms of a helpful definition of saying weeds  
**[1:23:06-1:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:06):**  are early successional habitat plants.  
**[1:23:09-1:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:09):**  And my general experience is that if we create the soil conditions and then the above ground  
**[1:23:15-1:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:15):**  conditions as well, those seeds, you know, if you have something covering the soil, if  
**[1:23:22-1:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:22):**  there's no sunlight getting to that seed and there's no heavy disturbance of that land,  
**[1:23:29-1:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:29):**  there's no stimulus for that seed to germinate.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:31):**  To germinate, right, right.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:33):**  You know, shifting gears a little bit here, organic matter and its ties to cation exchange  
**[1:23:41-1:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:41):**  capacity.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:42):**  Cation exchange capacity is another one of those things on a soil test.  
**[1:23:45-1:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:45):**  People see it.  
**[1:23:46-1:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:46):**  I'm not sure they fully understand it.  
**[1:23:48-1:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:48):**  From a chemical background, how would you explain that to somebody and how does that  
**[1:23:53-1:24:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:53):**  tie into increased organic matter and improving soils having a different cation capacity,  
**[1:24:02-1:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:02):**  cation exchange capacity compared to a soil that's poor?  
**[1:24:05-1:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:05):**  Yeah, well, in your soil test, keep in mind that cation exchange capacity is actually  
**[1:24:12-1:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:12):**  a calculation based on your soil test, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:19):**  So that's actually if you it's just a formula based on those three things.  
**[1:24:27-1:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:27):**  And then it also not assumes that you're also looking at those are your base.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:37):**  Those are your base cations.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:39):**  You also have acid cations being the H plus, the aluminum and then iron.  
**[1:24:46-1:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:46):**  I think those are the main ones.  
**[1:24:48-1:24:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:48):**  But essentially, theoretically, cation exchange capacity is how many cations, so cations being  
**[1:24:58-1:25:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:58):**  those ions with positive charges.  
**[1:25:02-1:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:02):**  How many cations can a soil particle grab onto most soil particles have a negative charge?  
**[1:25:11-1:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:11):**  And usually this is related to clays.  
**[1:25:15-1:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:15):**  In our part of the world, we have one to one clays which are not really we don't have very,  
**[1:25:22-1:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:22):**  very high cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:25:25-1:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:25):**  So we would have in the region of I think four, typically four to seven milliequivalents  
**[1:25:31-1:25:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:31):**  per 100 milligram.  
**[1:25:34-1:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:34):**  When you go up into the corn belt, you might have 20 to 27.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:40):**  The kicker about organic matter is that organic matter has a much higher cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:25:48-1:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:48):**  So it's got lots more negative sites on it that will hold on to these cations.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  And my understanding is that organic matter typically for a pound of organic, basically  
**[1:26:02-1:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:02):**  the cata, if you had pure organic matter, the CECs are closer to 300.  
**[1:26:08-1:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:08):**  So it stands to reason that when you start adding 10, 20,000 pounds of organic matter,  
**[1:26:17-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:17):**  one percent of organic matter is going to be roughly 20,000 pounds of organic matter  
**[1:26:22-1:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:22):**  in the top six inches of your soil.  
**[1:26:25-1:26:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:25):**  When you add that amount of organic matter, it stands to reason that your CECs will increase.  
**[1:26:40-1:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:40):**  What we've seen in systems where we, for instance, have not put lime is we've actually seen our  
**[1:26:46-1:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:46):**  CECs drop, even though the organic matter has gone up by one to two percent.  
**[1:26:55-1:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:55):**  So theoretically, CECs should be increasing.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:00):**  But because it's based on a calculation of your soil test, calcium, magnesium, potassium  
**[1:27:07-1:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:07):**  and sodium, I don't know that it always specifically reflects CECs.  
**[1:27:14-1:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:14):**  And I know if you add lime to your system, you're going to artificially raise that CEC  
**[1:27:19-1:27:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:19):**  if you're capturing that high volume of calcium in your soil test.  
**[1:27:27-1:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:27):**  More calcium in your soil test is not a bad thing.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:30):**  But we just have to be, I'm not enough of an expert of CECs, but I am aware that it's  
**[1:27:36-1:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  a calculation and one has to be careful of it and use it as a general rule of thumb and  
**[1:27:45-1:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:45):**  be just a little bit aware of it.  
**[1:27:48-1:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:48):**  One thing I'm trying to do through this series is encourage people to do more experimenting  
**[1:27:54-1:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:54):**  and try stuff and then know why they're doing what they're doing, not just accept, like  
**[1:27:59-1:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:59):**  off a soil test, I should add this.  
**[1:28:01-1:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:01):**  Why should you add it?  
**[1:28:02-1:28:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  What's actually going on?  
**[1:28:03-1:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:03):**  And to try and get people to be more citizen scientists.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:07):**  When you have something like your results with the Johnson-Sue Bioreactor, when you  
**[1:28:15-1:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:15):**  like the system, when you probably fundamentally think, hey, this makes sense, yet you don't  
**[1:28:20-1:28:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:20):**  get results that line up, how do you tackle that?  
**[1:28:24-1:28:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:24):**  What advice do you have for somebody who believes in something and wants to try something, then  
**[1:28:29-1:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:29):**  they do it and it's just kind of like, well, I got a nothing burger here.  
**[1:28:33-1:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:33):**  Well, farmers, you know, good innovative farmers like to fail at least once a year.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:41):**  I think it's just a question of persistence.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  And part of that might just be because you have a mindset that says, OK, well, that didn't  
**[1:28:53-1:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:53):**  work.  
**[1:28:55-1:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:55):**  It's not because David Johnson's system is not good, but it's something that I may or  
**[1:29:02-1:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:02):**  may not have done in my system.  
**[1:29:04-1:29:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:04):**  You know, I followed the recipe in my case.  
**[1:29:09-1:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:09):**  I followed the recipe.  
**[1:29:11-1:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:11):**  You know, looking back, sorry, I'm diverting.  
**[1:29:17-1:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:17):**  But I think it's just a question of persistence and understanding that if you meet with a  
**[1:29:27-1:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:27):**  lack of success in something, you know, it's back to the drawing board.  
**[1:29:33-1:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:33):**  It's rethinking through what could have gone wrong.  
**[1:29:39-1:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:39):**  Just to answer your question earlier on, you know, it might be that for me, I was taking  
**[1:29:48-1:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:48):**  beneficial microbes and putting them into a system where they didn't really have a great  
**[1:29:57-1:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:57):**  habitat.  
**[1:29:58-1:30:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:58):**  I would have thought it was a good habitat because it's a soil that's getting healthy,  
**[1:30:03-1:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:03):**  but they might have gone out there and, you know, subsisted off a little bit of milk and  
**[1:30:09-1:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:09):**  molasses that I gave them and then they died right there.  
**[1:30:13-1:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:13):**  Yeah.  
**[1:30:14-1:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:15):**  I think that's one thing a lot of people, they don't fully think through and I'm totally  
**[1:30:22-1:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:22):**  guilty of this is a lot of this stuff is contextual.  
**[1:30:25-1:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:25):**  Like it might work great in one particular biome, but as you know, from working in aquatic

**[1:30:36-1:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:36):**  not everything that works in South Carolina is going to work in California is going to

**[1:30:51-1:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:51):**  it to work in your system.  
**[1:30:54-1:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:30:55-1:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:30:56-1:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:30:57-1:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:57):**  Well, Buzz, I want to thank you for taking some time to come on and share everything  
**[1:31:01-1:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:01):**  that you're doing today.  
**[1:31:02-1:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:02):**  For people that want to learn more about the work that you're doing, you have a podcast,  
**[1:31:08-1:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08):**  you do consulting, if they want to follow along and learn more about you, where can  
**[1:31:13-1:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:13):**  they go?  
**[1:31:15-1:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:15):**  Well, the main place that we work in my labs at the School of Public Health is soil health  
**[1:31:27-1:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:27):**  labs.  
**[1:31:28-1:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:28):**  So if you go to soil health labs, plural, on Facebook, you'll see some of the stuff  
**[1:31:34-1:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:34):**  that we do.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:35):**  We work with the USDA in South Carolina.  
**[1:31:40-1:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:40):**  We've got a project that we're doing with Washington, DC, that takes us to Idaho and

**[1:31:53-1:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:53):**  Then we've also got a project that we've got with South Dakota called Maritor Myth.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:01):**  And we're thinking of changing that brand name, but if you follow Maritor Myth, we'll  
**[1:32:07-1:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:07):**  be telling you where we're headed.  
**[1:32:10-1:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:10):**  We're probably going to call it Growing Resilience.  
**[1:32:12-1:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:12):**  But the main place is to follow soil health labs and to follow some of the stuff that  
**[1:32:20-1:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:20):**  I've done over the last few years.  
**[1:32:23-1:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:23):**  On Facebook, I have a page called Dr. Buzz Kloot, but you'll see that I have been less

**[1:32:31-1:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:31):**  And most of it is trying to regroup after a lot of big flurry of activity from how much  
**[1:32:40-1:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:40):**  fertilizer do we really need to not good results with my Johnson Sue work.  
**[1:32:47-1:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:47):**  Great.  
**[1:32:48-1:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:48):**  Well, thanks again.  
**[1:32:50-1:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:50):**  I'll share it all, and I appreciate your work.  
**[1:32:53-1:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:53):**  Well, I appreciate your willingness to speak to me.  
**[1:32:58-1:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:58):**  It's been very good.  
**[1:32:59-1:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:59):**  You've asked me some very searching questions.  
**[1:33:02-1:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:02):**  So I hope I've done justice to your questions.

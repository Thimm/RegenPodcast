### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So we meet again.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:16):**  You kind of shoot yourself on the foot because as you apply the fertilizers, it makes it  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  a soil more amenable to weed growing in it.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:29):**  The weeds serve a purpose.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  The voice you're hearing?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  That's Dr. David Johnson.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  David is a molecular biologist and soil scientist focusing on fungally dominated composts and  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  carbon sequestration.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  David sees compost as more than just adding organic matter to the soil.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  It's a way of inoculating and adding biology to the soil.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  Today the conversation is going to range from fungally dominated compost and how little  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  you actually need to add of it to the soil to see an improvement to improving soil by  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  recreating and rebuilding the soil ecosystem, not just one part of it.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  David and his wife also created the Johnson-Sue Bioreactor as a way to create fungally dominated,  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:16):**  high quality compost to be used in agriculture.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  As a scientist, he's absolutely brilliant and I hope you get a lot out of this conversation.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:26):**  Let's jump right into it with Dr. David Johnson.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  So David, the first thing I really want to ask you was in all your years of dealing with  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  microbes, what has been the most fascinating thing to you?  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  Is there one thing that really stands out and just blew your mind when you found it  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:47):**  out?  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  Well gosh, there's a lot of things, but I think what really started to put it together  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  was the influence of our own stomach, our microbiome in our stomach on our health and  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  our well-being.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  And the number of things that they do and their relationship to our health, how they're  
**[0:02:06-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:06):**  about 80% of our immune system, and their ability to turn on and off genes in our body,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  all of this is fascinating.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  And it just transferred to the soil how we're seeing a regeneration of that soil microbiome  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  has so much influence on the productivity of the system, nitrogen fixation, phosphorus  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  solubilization.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:33):**  And as we bring it back, how much influence it can have.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  That has to be the biggest eye-opener.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  We woke up one morning and we had to pinch each other to make sure this wasn't a dream,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:48):**  that it was real.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:50):**  The potential that we saw to bringing these microbiomes back in soils.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:56):**  Where do you think agriculture's current understanding is of microbiology when it comes to soil?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  I think we can say we know it's there.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  We know it's more complex than we'll understand.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  But do you think agriculture really respects how important it is and how important the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  balance of those microbes are?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  At this point, there's very few.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  The people that are out on the leading edge are seeing this.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  They know that's it.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  But we're still probably back in the 60s looking at microbes as pathogens exclusively, not  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  as beneficial parts of the system.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  But we're getting there.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:42):**  I mean, we see Monsanto and Bayer start to bring out biologicals now because they see  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  this is the future.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:49):**  It's just a matter of time.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  I think this will be the agriculture of the future.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  Our understanding is still very limited on this.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  We're just scratching the surface.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  It's such a complex system.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  Elegantly complex.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  Totally complex nonetheless as far as the decisions we make in agriculture, how we treat  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  the soil, all the different operations that we perform on the soil.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:17):**  We still have a lot to learn on that.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  But there's so much potential when it is brought back properly.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  What we're seeing both in rangeland and cropland.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  If we look at rangeland or cropland, where do you think the biggest miss is right now  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  in terms of biology in those soils?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  So we're not talking chemicals or anything like that that can obviously harm that biology.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  But in terms of the biology present in those soils, are farmers not doing enough to encourage  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:46):**  the right kind?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  Are they not doing enough to encourage any kind?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  Are they just too much of one?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  Where do you see soils right now?  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  I think most of the practices that we've adopted over the last 150 years have been degrading  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  soil microbiomes.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  Either through plowing or disking or the application of all the different biocides.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  All of this has been a negative influence on building solar biology.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  And as I say, those farmers and rangers that are out on the leading edge, they understand  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  that that is what they're raising, is the soil biology.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:25):**  The bacteria are the grass of that system as far as the consumption by organisms at  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  higher trophic levels.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:34):**  And they're understanding that if they do the right management techniques, they can  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:40):**  bring those soils back.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  Many of them have.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  We've seen some very interesting changes in rangeland.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  Half of us here in the Chihuahuan desert, we have one rancher that's gone from 250 acres  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  per cow to 25 acres per cow.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:57):**  Just with grazing management.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:59):**  And this is not an unusual story.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  We see another rancher here in central New Mexico, Nancy Ranny.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  How she's gone from four species of grasses to 45 species of grasses in less than a decade.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:13):**  And bringing back, in our area, I live in the desert.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  And it's the desert because of one reason.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  It's because we overgrazed it.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  It used to be grasslands belly high to a horse when the Spaniards came through.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  But then with our grazing techniques, we grazed it into a desert.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  And nice to know is with proper grazing, you can bring it back.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  But that seems to be the only mechanism is what developed on the Great Plains with the  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  bison and how they were kept in tight herds with predators.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  And they were moved along at regular intervals, it deposited their dung and their urine and  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:50):**  their saliva.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  Basically inoculating that grazing land as they every time they would go over it.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  Because the manure would be rolled up into small balls by the dung beetles placed in  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  the ground and composted in place.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:06):**  It was just a great inoculation event.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  And it built up some impressive grasslands.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  I mean soil carbon five, six feet deep, the ability to grow forage in even low water environments.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  The rancher Alejandro Correo, south of us, he gets seven inches of rain.

**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  And he now has grasses belly high to a horse.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  So we can do the same thing in our crop land as well.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  Focusing on restoring that microbiology in the system.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  And it's a system.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:50):**  That's what we need to look at it as.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  It's not just bringing back fungi.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  It's not just bringing back bacteria.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  It's a whole system that we have to recreate in that cycling of the carbon and cycling  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  of the nitrogen.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:05):**  It's an energy equation.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  We have completely destroyed the productivity of these soils.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:12):**  We're working with compromised photosynthetic capacity on these soils.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  And as we bring this biology back, we can increase the amount of photosynthesis, the

**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  Because the biology seems to be key.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  It is for us.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  And it appears to be the same for the soils.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:43):**  When you go from four species to I think you said 40 species in that example.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  What's changing in the soil to allow those extra X number of species to now say I can

**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:57):**  It's not just all manure being deposited.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:00):**  In other words, if we just took grassland and we just put manure over the top of it  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:04):**  or compost over the top.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  So it's again, it's the restoration system.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  It takes a certain amount of disturbance as well.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  I could recommend a video that Peter Vick put out on a rancher in Texas that the name

**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  This particular one in Texas, in order to restore the soils that were just barren, it

**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  It's as I say, it's a system that we're trying to bring back in all these different compartments,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  into the design of the hoof of the cow and how its impact on the soil.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:04):**  The saliva and also the tearing of that grass when the cow eats it produces hormones that

**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:16):**  In the Great Plains, usually only about 40% of that forage was actually consumed by the

**[0:10:23-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:23):**  About 60% was either trampled into the ground or left there for a food resource for microbes.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  There's a certain amount of the carbon that has to go back into this system in order to  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  start rebuilding these soils.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  But if you have reduced photosynthetic capacity on the front end, which is what we're really  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  fighting right now, unless we bring that back, we're not going to be able to build the carbon  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:48):**  up in the soils the way we should be able to.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  The fungi we're finding in a research project, again with Peter Bick in the Southeast, looking  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  at about five pairs of ranchers doing either the adaptive multipathic grazing and a conventional  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  for at least a decade.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  What I'm seeing in the research that I've done is it's the fungal community that we've  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  destroyed in all these systems.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  It's the most fragile, but the fungi function as both logistics and communication.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  They transport elemental nutrients in cooperation with the bacteria in the soil to the plant  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  in exchange for the energy that that plant has captured to fund or energize that system  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  in the soil for the microbes to be able to extract or fix the nutrients from the atmosphere.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:40):**  If we can't bring back that photosynthetic capacity, we're not going to really be able  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  to fix these soils.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  But the nice thing is we can.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  We've seen in this research the ability to increase productivity five times on forage  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:54):**  production in these systems.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  As you bring this biology back, it starts stacking on itself, increased carbon into  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  the system.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  We're also seeing on the back end a reduced respiration rate, at least a relative respiration  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  rate.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:11):**  The carbon that stays in the soil longer, you get a better carbon use efficiency.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  Most of the ranchers or most of the scientists are going to look at this and say, okay, you've  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:24):**  increased carbon by 14 times.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  You've increased the soil microbial community biomass by five times.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:34):**  Going to the current perspective, you're going to increase respiration.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  But the funny thing is as you bring this fungal community back, as you bring the whole system  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  back in into operation, you are going to respire a little more carbon, but it levels off.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:53):**  So relative to the amount of carbon that you have in the soil to start with that could  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  be oxidizable or respirable by the microbes, they don't respire it.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  They put it more into more biological growth than into respiration.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:08):**  That increasing the biology in the system increases the ability of that system to extract  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  the nutrients from the soil parent material.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  The system just starts stacking and building on each other.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  More nutrients available, more energy and carbon available in the system, more plant  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  growth.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  At least that's what I'm observing.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  It's not only in grazing, but in crop land as well.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  You talk photosynthetic capacity and increasing that to build up the below ground biology.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  What is it above surface that's happening that's helping below surface?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  Is it just more sugars coming out of the roots, more exudates coming out of the roots?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  So the more you can grow up top, the more is being pumped down below?  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  I think a lot of it is that having the microbes there to make the nutrients available.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  In photosynthesis and in nitrogen fixation, they're all protein structures that are performing  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  all these metabolic functions.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  In every protein, you have metal cofactors that allow these energy conversions to occur.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  This depends on magnesium as far as the capture of the energy from the sun.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  But there's a whole suite of other proteins along the line in the transferring that energy  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  that are required for an efficient flow of energy.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  If you don't have the microbes in the soil to extract those nutrients and make them vital,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:42):**  I'm talking more than just nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  These plants use almost all of the 92 naturally occurring elements on the periodic table.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  There's no way as farmers and ranchers that we can contemplate what we need to add to  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  the system or what we need to make available as far as these micronutrients to make the  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:03):**  system function properly.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  And yet nature has over the last 45 million or 53 million years on grazing land has developed  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:13):**  a system that's quite efficient at doing this if we allow it.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  If we look at the Great Plains as they used to be, and I know there's some still small

**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  And then we have cropland that has been treated conventionally for let's say 100 years.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:35):**  And it's what we classify as poor soil compared to that Great Plains soil.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:41):**  Can you walk on it through a step by step process, not in terms of how, but in terms  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  of as we change our management practices, what would happen to that poor soil on its  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:53):**  way to becoming that deep Great Plains soil?  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  What does that story mean?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  Well, you know, I have to take you back to what we're seeing in the human microbiome.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  In one instance where they've done an experiment and they've removed fiber from the diet of  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  mice to see what happens to that stomach microbiome.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  They have a decrease in diversity in that system.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  The more generations it goes through, you just get a decreased diversity all the way  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  through.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:29):**  You would think, okay, we'll bring the fiber back, you know, just bring the carbon back  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  in your soil.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  But it doesn't restore that microbiome structure.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:39):**  It doesn't bring back diversity.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  The only way it brings it back is if you come in with an inoculation from a healthy microbiome.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:48):**  And we're seeing the same thing in humans that if people suffer Crohn's disease, IBS,  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:54):**  decades, some people die from it.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  Some people have resections of their intestines, more antibiotic regimes.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  And yet they find out that if you can bring the microbiome from a healthy individual,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  like in a fecal transplant, and put it in to the person with IBS or Crohn's, in many  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:14):**  cases they can be cured in 24 hours.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  And it seems to be that essential or important in these soils that we've broken is to bring  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:25):**  that biology back.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  We see just with an inoculation of the compost in the bioreactor, we did research in a project  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  in Wilcox, Arizona, where we came in with two pounds of compost per acre as an extract  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  that we injected into the furrow at planting.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  In that research, what we saw is we compared a conventional approach with 256 pounds of  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  nitrogen.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  We had an intermediate treatment with 15% of that, or 38 pounds of nitrogen in that  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:02):**  two pounds of the compost.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  And then we had another treatment just with the compost, the two pounds per acre rate.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  What we saw is we matched productivity to the conventional with the beam or the compost  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  plus 15% productivity, 15% nitrogen.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  That 218 bushels of corn.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:26):**  And this was quite unexpected because we replaced probably 180 pounds of nitrogen in that system  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  just with biology.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  And in the compost only, we only suffered a 6.6% loss in productivity.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  So there was again, about 140 to 150 pounds of nitrogen that we brought into that system  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  just with the biology.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  So it's from what we're seeing in this research is that you need to be able to bring a healthy  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  community back into this.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  And the compost process that my wife and I developed seems to give you a very robust  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:07):**  and diverse microbial community.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  We see as you allow it to mature, we see a four times increase in the diversity of the  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  microbes.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  You'll see microbes that start out in the composting process.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  And at the end of that year, they're not dominant.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  Some of them aren't even present, but they've been replaced by a whole nother suite of microorganisms  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  that have much more diversity and much more capability.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:35):**  So again, we're learning a lot on this.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:38):**  It's not all known.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  We're still at the very beginning and say scratching the surface as I was saying earlier  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:47):**  to you.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  Is inoculation enough?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  Meaning it has, well, I mean, in the sense of it has, there has to be food in that soil  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  for the organisms you're putting into that soil to consume.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  So and I know this is generalizing, but do you think that most soils, there's enough  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  food there for microbes?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  If you add microbes, at least some will be able to proliferate, multiply, and establish  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:19):**  themselves?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  Or do you need that inoculant plus food source or the inoculant at the same time?  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:27):**  It's again a system.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:29):**  And the microbes won't do it by themselves.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  This is not magic.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  They need a living plant at all times to have that carbon flow.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  It's kind of like banking, you know, you need a certain amount of money going into your  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  savings account in order to build things up.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  But it's a system that we're trying to restore and having a plant grow all the time, either  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:54):**  cover crop or commodity crop is essential to restoring the biology.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  It won't happen without plants.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:02):**  It's that relationship that developed between the soil microbiome and the plants that make  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  this planet what it is today.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  So I know from watching some videos of presentations you've done, when you've applied some of the  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  compost to different properties, it's very sparse, I would say, compared to what some  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:19):**  people do.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  Imagine you took a sheet of white paper and you kind of threw a handful of seeds on it.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  You're going to see a lot of white around those seeds.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  And that's the rate that you're applying and you're seeing a big difference.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  I know at least in the small scale farming world, a lot of compost application is you  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:35):**  have a white sheet of paper.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  You put compost on, you have covered that white sheet of paper and you can see zero  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  white.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  So on one hand, beforehand, you have the concentrated inoculant going into the soil.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  On the other hand, you have people just piling compost on.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  Do you think that an approach of just constantly putting on compost is it's working, but maybe  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  you're working too hard or it's not really a means to an end?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  Is there some way that people can move from this, just dump it on to a more sparse application?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  Well, yeah, that's what we're seeing.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  I started out at 400 pounds per acre, which is a dusting.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  So it's not a nutrient amendment the way we're developing this.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  It's an inoculant of the microbiome.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  We're down now to two pounds per acre.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:33):**  Even having success.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  I mean, the farmer was $80 an acre more profitable by using the compost from this bioreactor  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  and that research in Wilcox.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:49):**  This was a very, very poor soil that we started.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:52):**  It was very compacted.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  Some of the infiltration rates on it were above 10 minutes.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  So it was a very compacted soil.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  We did grow a cover crop on it before we planted this first year.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  Instead of growing into the soil, the root mass would push the soil up.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  So when you drove over it, it was like driving over a corrugated surface.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  So we didn't start with a great soil on this.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  We did have one cover crop under our belt on it.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  But then we came in with the biology and we saw that dramatic improvement in the productivity  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:31):**  without the use of nitrogen minerals.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  So it's, again, it's a system that we're bringing back and understanding that it's not magic.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:43):**  It's just biology, microbiology.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  And it depends on a constant flow of energy, just like we do.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  If we don't have energy, we're cavemen.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  If we have a little more energy into the system, we start to be able to do more things.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  We start to be able to procreate more.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:02):**  You start even more energy, you start to have specializations of the different organisms.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:10):**  Add a little more energy into the system.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  Eventually, you'll have synergy in these systems as you bring the biology back and the energy  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:17):**  into the system.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  It's all about energy flow on this planet.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  And it's the microbes that developed all the different protein structures to capture that  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  energy and to channel it through living organisms.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  And this is what we have to try to restore, is that whole system that evolved on the planet  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  and to our benefit as far as being able to grow the food that we need to grow.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  Restoring a poor soil is more better initially.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  And I'm thinking small scale here.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  Somebody who has a thousand acres, they love the sound of two pounds per acre.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  Somebody who has one acre could say, I can do two thousand pounds on my one acre.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  That's not a problem for me to distribute that out.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  Is there an assumption or is there a direct correlation between, took really high quality  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  compost at the food source and inoculant in one and you put more of it on a poor soil  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  initially you're going to get results that much faster?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  Yeah, I can just relate what I've done in the research.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:26):**  I just did an experiment looking at the influence of garden and these are still low rates at  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  two pounds, five pounds, 10 pounds and 20 pounds per acre rate.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:38):**  I saw no difference in the productivity between that many different rates.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  But what I did notice in, I had another experiment going on beside it of a in-furrow treatment.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  All those were in-furrow, they were sprayed in as I planted the seed, but I had one where  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:58):**  I sprayed the inoculant on top of the surface.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  And then I watered it in immediately.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:05):**  There was double the productivity of the injected into the furrow at planting compared to spraying  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:12):**  it on top.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:14):**  So it was pretty dramatic to see these plants doing double the productivity, same amount  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:21):**  of water, same amount of sunlight.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  And yet the productivity was so much higher when the biology was right there with the  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  seed when it germinated.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  So higher rates, I don't have the data in between 400 pounds and 40 pounds.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:40):**  That would be something to look at.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:42):**  But I've been looking at larger scale productivity because I know we need to make a change.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  I see 70 farmers hitting a brick wall as far as they've destroyed the soil fertility.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  They're making cents an acre on profitability.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:02):**  And yet they know they can't pass this land on to their son or their daughter because  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  it would be a burden to them.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  And yet as you bring back the system and its functionality, farming becomes fun again.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  I've never seen happier farmers and more profitable farmers.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:21):**  And those that are starting to look at this as a biological system, that are starting  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  to use that power of observation to say, okay, what do I need to do next?  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  It's not intuitive.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  Nature depends on diversity.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:37):**  Diversity not only in the community of microbes are there, but also in the activity that goes  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:42):**  on above the soil.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  As far as what you plant, when you plant, how do you treat this, how do you treat that.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:51):**  There's a full lifetime of education in farming.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:54):**  It's not all easy button.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  You do it this way every year.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:59):**  So there's a lot to learn, but observation will be key.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  It sounds like that's a case where an inch could make a big difference.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  I'm thinking you're drilling in seed.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:08):**  It's not going in that deep, but you're injecting the inoculant in with the seed as you're drilling  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  it in versus you put it on soil and then you water it in.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  This intuitively to me, it doesn't seem like number two, the water in method would leave  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:25):**  it that far away, but apparently there is enough of a difference there that that biology  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  needs that root interaction right away to really get going.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  Why do you think that is?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  Yes, it's just having that community available as it germinates.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  The Hagerty's in Australia, when they do the very similar injection rate, it's two kilograms  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  per hectare, which is almost identical to two pounds per acre.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  You can see pictures of the seed and how much, barely German germ, the cotyledon's only about  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  an inch long.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  Yet the rhizosphere that's developed in that community that is impressive, has devoted  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  a lot of energy to associating with those microbes.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  If they're not there and available, it just seems like the plant just flounders.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  I could show you a picture of what it looks like.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  There's a dramatic difference of where I've injected and where I sprayed it on top.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  So on a small scale for somebody farming, maybe the ideal way to get this going would  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  be if you're doing a lot of transplanting of your plants, would be when you're seeding  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  these plants, you're either coating that seed or you're quote inoculating that seed in the  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  beginning in the nursery.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  So when it goes into the field, you're transporting that cube of soil that has not just roots,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  but a community with it that goes into the soil and then it can multiply out in the soil  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  once it's there because the plant and obviously that community are staying together.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  Seed coatings work.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  The hagridies also, they spray their seed with the inoculant as they feed it into their  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  hopper.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:16):**  I've done some experiments where I've sprayed the seed and planted it dry and sprayed the  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  seed and planted it wet.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  And there's a dramatic difference between dry and wet.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  Wet will outgrow the dry treated quite handily.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  So it's having that living community available at germination that seems to make this work  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  so well.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  At this point in the episode, I mean, we're talking a lot about inoculant compost, your  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  specific way of making compost.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  I want to introduce people to the idea of the type of compost you make.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  At its core, what are the base principles around the compost that you're using?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  The method that we developed maintains several, four key factors on this.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  It's aerobic.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  It always has oxygen.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:07):**  The way the bioreactor is designed with the columns up the middle, you're never more than  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:13):**  6 to 12 inches from ambient air.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  So it's a completely aerobic process.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  It's a process that operates at about 70% moisture content.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  That's critical.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  It's undisturbed.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:29):**  You never turn it.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:31):**  You don't need to.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  As long as it's aerobic, as long as you have the 70% moisture content, the biodegradation  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:39):**  process goes forward and it seems to increase in diversity, the microbial diversity, the  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  longer that you let it go.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  Also we employ worms in it.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  So it is a vermicompost as well.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:50):**  And the worms, we only put in about 100 worms, the red wigglers.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:57):**  Just after it gets down past 80 degrees Fahrenheit so you don't cook them.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  And they will, about 100 of those will populate that pile completely by the time it's done  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  and it'll be full of baby worms.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  And the ending texture is a lot like clay.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:15):**  You can squeeze it between your fingers.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:17):**  You can squish it into a ball when it's done.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:22):**  And it's, the microbial community is pretty impressive.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  When I do metagenomics on it, we see about 2,700 species of bacteria.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  We see probably 4 to 500 species of fungi.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  So it's, that's another thing that's having it 70% moisture content, having it aerobic,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  that allows fungi to proliferate.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:48):**  And you end up with a significant number of fungal spores because over that year you start  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:52):**  to consume all the energy resources in that compost.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:56):**  So what does the fungi do when it runs out of food in its environment?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  It'll sporulate so it can live when conditions are better.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  So we see a significant number of spores.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  And that's what we're putting in with the extract is we're seeing spores of fungi and  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  also a lot of bacteria.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:16):**  So it's restoring that community through that process.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  With a clay-like texture at the end of it, I think that's different than a lot of compost  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:26):**  you see people buy that looks more like, it's kind of mulchy.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:31):**  It still has identifiable bits of organic matter in it.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  It have a different hand feel or kind of friable.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:41):**  What are the big differences you see in Johnson Sue bioreactor compost versus traditional  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:48):**  compost?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  They sell a landscape yard near you and they sell compost.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  What are the differences in those methods?  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:54):**  Well, the methodology, they're turning that compost several times in the first week.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  So the fungal community never really gets to develop.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:05):**  And every time they turn it, the system reheats up.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  So you don't go through that phase.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  In this composting method that we use, you're through the thermophilic phase and that heating  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  phase within a week and the temperature starts to go down.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  It depends on what you put into it.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:23):**  As far as how high the temperature goes, the more nitrogen you put in there, the higher  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  the temperature will go and the longer it will stay.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  But normally, the heating phase is four to five days.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:34):**  After that first week, you're pretty much through and the temperature will start going  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  down.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  This whole system allows that fungal community to dominate.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  So you don't see that in turned compost because every time they turn it, they destroy all  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:49):**  the fungal hyphae.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  You can see this within 24 hours after you fill that bioreactor in the method that we  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:56):**  use, you can go and you can start to pull the organic matter that you put in apart and  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  you can see all these hyphae, both of the fungi and actinomycetes just completely populated  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  the pile.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  So the pipes that we put in the middle, I think there's six pipes that we put in there,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  but after 24 hours, you can pull those out.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  I mean, the hyphae from the actinomycetes and the fungi have completely threaded that  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  pile together.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  So you have a column once you pull those pipe out that doesn't collapse.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  As it matures, the whole system will start to fold in on itself.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:34):**  You'll end up with something that looks like a very rich dark chocolate cake at the end.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:40):**  If you grab it and have any moisture in it, you can squeeze it and it does just meld together  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  like clay.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  That's what we're observing in the compost process.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  I think one of the biggest comments I've seen on the one that I built was a lot of people  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  have suggested, add this to it, add that to it.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  They're all nitrogen sources and they're all saying, do this and it'll speed it up.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  They're missing the point here that the goal isn't fast results.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:08):**  The goal is the right results and that just takes time.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:13):**  So if you did try to speed this up by adding fish emulsion or whatever to it, what are  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:19):**  you trading off?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  What are you missing?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  I tried at the beginning on some other, you know, before we developed this by trying to  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:30):**  add nitrogen to the system to speed it up.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  It failed.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:36):**  What I see is, you know, a lot of the resources I used to make these piles are very low in  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  nitrogen.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  I mean, you're talking leaves, 50 to 60 to one or higher.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  And I saw that the benefit is allowing the system to fix its own nitrogen with free-living  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  nitrogen fixing bacteria, you start to develop those community of microbes that can do that.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:02):**  And I saw there's plenty of nitrogen in the composting process because I see a lot of  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:07):**  free-living nitrogen fixers.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:10):**  That community develops very strongly in these composts.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  You know, I've got the metagenomic data that I can show you.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  This group right here, they're free-living and they're a major component of the system.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  So I think the more you can leave it alone and let nature take its course, it's like  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:28):**  a good wine or a good cheese or good bread.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:33):**  All of these, you know, it's a system that you kind of let nature do what she's done  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:38):**  for millions of years.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  And the results seem to show a much better compost.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  So is this idea that you see a lot out there of 18 days to finish compost, 30 days to finish

**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  Do you think that's doing more harm than good?  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:56):**  Whether you're sure you're adding organic matter to the soil and that will help your  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  soil in the long term, but it's like you're only focusing on half the picture.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  You're not seeing the whole picture.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:08):**  I think from the research I've seen, if you can allow nature to do it in her time frame,  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:18):**  the results are much better.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  I mean, I don't know that they can use theirs at a two pound rate and see this type of benefit.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  I know the Hagerty's observed in Australia, they got their compost from one person on  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  the east coast of Australia and they're on the west coast.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  They had it shipped all the way across Australia, which is not a small country.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  And they thought, well, we'll just use somebody else's compost.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  And it failed.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:46):**  So I think that's what we're doing an experiment right now to see how consistent these composts  
**[0:38:54-0:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  made all across the USA to see how different they are or how similar they are.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:02):**  So that will hopefully answer a few of those questions that we have on it.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  As I say, there's still a lot we don't know.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  But what we do know is it's beneficial to plant growth.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  It can be applied for a cost from 25 to 50 cents an acre if you're a large farmer.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  It grows great tomatoes just straight.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  If you're a regular farmer just doing a garden at home, you can't go wrong with this stuff.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  It really makes a difference in the way plants grow.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:31):**  What are your thoughts on forcing air into the system, injecting air into the system  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  where you're not turning it?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  You take that exact same setup, you observe all the other base principles and you're not  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  keeping it moist, only you are blowing air into it.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:46):**  I've read some studies on that and it seems like fungi can just increase their efficiency,  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:53):**  growth rates, give more oxygen present.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  I see, okay, well you are using an outside input.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:59):**  It requires some extra parts.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  But I don't see it changing what you're going for that much.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:05):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  From what I would say to even dry the pile up if you're forcing air through it.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:15):**  This is more, we developed this basically both for third world and to be able to do  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:22):**  it in a first world country with parallel processing.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:26):**  The bioreactor is four foot diameter, five foot high.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  We wanted it as energy free as far as having input.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  The biggest input is a gallon and a half of water a day being sprayed over the top and  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  allowed to go through by gravity to keep the moisture content at 70%.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:48):**  That's the only energy impact into this system.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  I think we were concerned, I guess, more with third world when we designed this just to  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  make sure that they could do something like this.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  We do have those bioreactors going in three different countries in Africa, India, Pakistan,  
**[0:41:07-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  Siberia, believe it or not, Crimea, all over Europe, New Zealand, Australia, South America,  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  Central America, and many here in the US and Canada.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  I think it's the less energy input, the less work you have to do with this, the better  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:29):**  off it is.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  Don't think you'll speed it up that much by blowing air because as long as the pile is  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  aerobic, what more does it need?  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:37):**  It doesn't need any more airflow.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40):**  The research idea I found that anything more than a foot into a compost pile goes anaerobic  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  within minutes.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:49):**  We're never more, as I say, more than six inches to a foot away from ambient air.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  This pile stays aerobic all the time.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  I can't see the need to actually pump air into it.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  No, no, fair enough.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  Another big question I see is, kind of answered it there, but give me your thoughts on this,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:06):**  I'm doing this here in Southern California, nice weather year round.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  A lot of people in temperate climates have said, well, how does this work in an area  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:13):**  where I have four months of true winter?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  You mentioned Siberia.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  If you go from a warmer climate or say a tropical climate to something temperate and cold, do  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  you see performance or do you just need more time?  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:27):**  If you can keep it warm, keep it from freezing.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  You had one large one done in central Colorado where they had to put it into a greenhouse  
**[0:42:37-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  and they used a different system, same principles, but they did a 30 by 40 foot bioreactor with  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  all the pipes and everything and a floor underneath that allowed the airflow and they were successful.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:50):**  They produced a really good compost, about 100 tons of it.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:56):**  And the pile didn't get down to 32 degrees, but when they went in and dug, the worms were  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:02):**  still active.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  So it may take a little more time in a colder climate, but you need to keep it from freezing.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  It's a living organism.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:12):**  The worms in there are transiting and having their impact on the biodegradation process  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  and all the other organisms as well.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  So if you can either keep it inside.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  We had one dairy farmer in, was it Manitoba, that keeps it in his dairy barn and his cows  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  keep it warm.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  And we had another one in Quebec that is looking at, he keeps an anaerobic pile going that  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:39):**  he can maintain airflow to, to keep the temperature of that pile up.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:43):**  He has a water loop through that and he runs that into an aquaculture that he keeps good  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  to minus 45.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  So it's, you can stack hay bales around it, maybe put a heat tape underneath it.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  Just innovate as far as trying to keep it from freezing, put it next to a warm building  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:04):**  and hay bale that or inside.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  Some people are doing it inside in their shops and just keeping it where it won't freeze.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:13):**  But there are tougher environments.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  Yeah, we're in New Mexico, so that's not an issue.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  Although we've been down to minus 16 for three days in a row on some of my bioreactors and  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  not above zero and they still did fine.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:27):**  As long as there's a warm up period after it.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  And the great thing about it, you want to put it inside a barn or shop is there's really,  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:34):**  I haven't noticed any smell.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  I know you claim that.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  I can verify that there's no odors, there's no flies, none of that.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:41):**  You're not watering enough to have like water drained through the bottom of it.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:45):**  So it's a relatively clean system to have inside.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  Yeah, it's quite unique that it doesn't smell.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  That's the biggest problem.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  What shuts down composting operations is the smells, the odors, and also the fluent that  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  runs off from the process.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  But there's no runoff from this process when it's done right.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  And there's no smells.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:09):**  As long as you put the pile together right, you won't have smells.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:13):**  Does the system scale up and down if you keep those same base principles?  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:19):**  Never more than 12 inches away from oxygen.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:22):**  So if we had enough up pipes that we eventually removed, we kept it at that moisture content.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:28):**  But I go bigger.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  You had a 30 by 41 so obviously it can go a lot bigger.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:33):**  Did you go smaller?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  One thing I've tried a lot here over the years before I even discovered yours is I've done  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  this in trash cans where I drill holes in the side of a trash can down the center.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  I've always put a tube in there.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:45):**  After I saw your system initially, I didn't.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:47):**  But just put the tube in the center.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  It took me a little while to figure it out.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:51):**  It works really well I think.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  It took me a little while to figure it out too.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  If it wasn't for my wife, Wei-Tien, this bioreactor would never be.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:59):**  I would have been turning compost by hand in a windrow.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  Sure, sure.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:05):**  So credit to her.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  I mean it makes it easy and I always left the tube in there and then I went back and  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  watched the videos and like oh he's pulling the tubes out and I was really nervous to  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  pull the tube out.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  I was too.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:16):**  No problem.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  The school of hard knocks and serendipity here.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:22):**  And the wife saying, I'm tired of washing your clothes.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:27):**  We're going to do this.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  So just do it, do it.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  So yeah, with the system, can you scale up and down or do you need a perfect mass?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:38):**  We have some people scaling down.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  I can never have enough of this.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:44):**  You put about 2,000 pounds of wet material into it in this size bioreactor and you end  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  up with 700 pounds product.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  So if you're a farmer, you can get what, 350 acres.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  Looks like if it's a really good compost, you could probably get a full section off  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  of one bioreactor.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  So how much do you need?  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  As I say, you can never have enough, at least when you're doing research and people asking  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  you for it, all that.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  But one bioreactor can cover a lot of area if you need it to.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:18):**  And yet you can parallel process them, make more units, start them at different times,  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  have them available at different times.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:27):**  It's really easy to, with the finished product, just open that cage up and be able to access  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  the compost the way we designed it.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  And then you can close it back and hold it, just keep it going.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:41):**  The finished compost, if you have any leftover, we'll make a smaller bioreactor, about a two  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:47):**  foot diameter, about 18 inch high, and we'll put the compost in there.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:50):**  We'll throw a drip system or irrigation system on it to keep it wet, and we'll put alfalfa  
**[0:47:57-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:57):**  on the top to keep the worms fed.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  But it can go for a long time.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:02):**  I've had some up to four years, and eventually I had to use it.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:08):**  So I don't know past four years, but it stayed good up to four years.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  As long as you keep, put some alfalfa, ground up alfalfa on top to keep the worms fed, and  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:19):**  they're doing what they do in a system.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  One of the more popular trends in smaller scale homesteading gardening for vegetables  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  is wood chip mulching over garden beds.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:33):**  If you think about the base principles behind the bioreactor, we're never more than 12 inches  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:37):**  away from oxygen, we're keeping it moist, it's slow.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  What are your thoughts about, let's say we didn't put the material into the bioreactor  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:47):**  and we just laid it down on our production beds, it was only 10 inches thick, so even  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  the bottom wasn't 12 inches away from ambient air.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  We're watering it to keep it moist.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:00):**  Do you think you're using anything in that type of system versus having it in that cylindrical  
**[0:49:07-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:07):**  bioreactor, so composting quote in situ versus creating compost in a composting device?  
**[0:49:14-0:49:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  You know, since you said wood chips, wood chips, I only use wood chips in this at the  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:21):**  beginning because I started with dairy manure.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  I'm now just using straight leaves or straight alfalfa to compost.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:29):**  Just something that breaks down easier.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:30):**  The wood chips are ideal for the garden.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:35):**  I think any type of cover that you can offer to that soil to allow that in situ restoration  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42):**  or that microbial community, I do it on my garden.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  I mulch my garden heavy because, well, number one, I can't keep up with the weeds if I don't  
**[0:49:50-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  do it and it's so much more beneficial as far as I use less water.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  Just to have the biology working there, I don't have to haul it in.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  I definitely recommend mulching if you have a garden.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  It's just a no brainer when it comes just to the weed issues.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:14):**  They keep a nice environment there where you have your roly polys and they will pretty  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:19):**  much clear cut anything that tries to sprout underneath that mulch.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:23):**  I found that out the hard way with a cover crop that I rolled and planted cotton into.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  Roly polys would come in and clear cut my cotton.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  You do have to do transplants that way unless you protect a seedling, a seed either with  
**[0:50:44-0:50:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  I'll use a court glass jar for when I'm seeding like my cantaloupe or my tomatoes or my chilies.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:50):**  I'll just put a jar over it till it germinates and that keeps the insects from coming in  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  and clear cutting it.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  There's a lot you'll learn on this as you go through the process.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  Again, observation is really helpful.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:08):**  One thing I love the idea of is multiplying it out in the form of an extract.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  Let's say you have one bioreactor, 2,000 pounds in, 700 pounds of finished product out.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  Now you want to increase that and essentially turn it into more than 700 pounds.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  How can somebody go about making an extract to coat seeds with?  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:31):**  On the seed coating, if it's strictly a seed coating, I would go with a slurry.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:36):**  That's really simple.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  Take about 10 pounds of compost and I'll add a cup of milk where it has about a tablespoon  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:45):**  of molasses in it.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:48):**  Then I'll add enough water to make a slurry like a pancake batter.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  I'll push that through a screen to get all any of the large organic matter that didn't  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  degrade, something that would go through a seeder small enough.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  I will take one quarter of that with a 50-pound bag of seed and I'll tumble that in a cement  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  mixer for about a minute and a half to coat the seed.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  Then plant it as quickly as you can, even damp.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  It will actually flow better, a little damp in your planter if it's a large system.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:22):**  Then you've got that slurry coated seed.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  The extract is different.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  You just make an extract.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  I have a YouTube channel that most of this is available on as far as making the slurry  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  and coating the seed or making the extract.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  That's another mechanism.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  If you forget what I say here, you can go on YouTube and just look for me and then you'll  
**[0:52:46-0:52:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:46):**  find my channel.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:47):**  There are not great videos, but I think enough to help you get the idea of how it works.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  Yeah, that's what I use actually to build mine.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:56):**  So I found it very helpful.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:00):**  Oh, okay.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:01):**  Long lines of extract, what are your thoughts about using it as a tea?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  Put some in, bubble it, and then use it as a foliar spray, not to provide nutrients to  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:13):**  the plant, but just to get that beneficial microbiology on the surface.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  Okay.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  Yeah, the Hagertys do that as well.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  They'll do a seed coat, an injection, and they come back with a foliar after the plant's  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  about six to eight inches high.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:30):**  They see benefits.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:31):**  When I look at making a tea, as you're saying, you're brewing it.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  You're putting in food resources to boost the microbial community.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:41):**  I've done some analysis on the community of these systems.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:45):**  As you brew it, you start to bias the population.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  You start to lose the diversity where the microbes that can utilize the nutrients that  
**[0:53:55-0:53:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:55):**  you put in there will increase in population.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:59):**  The others that don't, that are maybe secondary or third down the line on the different byproducts  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:05):**  of other organisms, they will fade away.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:09):**  So I saw a loss in the diversity of the system as you brew it, just because of the nutrients  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  that you add to the system.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:20):**  Do you think you could maintain that diversity, yet get the benefit by doing something like  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:25):**  this?  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:26):**  I add some number five cups of it to a bucket.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  I fill that five gallon bucket with water.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:33):**  I just stir it around enough to agitate it and kind of cleanse the material, organic  
**[0:54:39-0:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:39):**  matter of anything that's on the surface.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:42):**  I've mixed it up.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  Now I use that straight, so I just stir it and go right out to the plant.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:47):**  That's basically an extract.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  I just recirculate.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:50):**  I have a system with an agricultural pump and I recirculate it to a 55 gallon drum.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  I keep washing the compost with that water that's recycling.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:05):**  So that's, the extractor's online as well, but it's, you're right, it's just knocking  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:10):**  the microbes off the organic matter.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:14):**  What we're seeing, I did some analysis on this, we were seeing about 83 million bacteria  
**[0:55:21-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  per square foot put into the field, in that field in Wilcox, and a little over 10 million  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  fungal spores at that two pound rate.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  So per square foot, that's a pretty significant number of microbes, especially when you bring  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  that diversity back in.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  Have you seen any correlation in any of your studies between the amount of quote, weeds  
**[0:55:44-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:44):**  in the soil and the progression of that soil from something that's more bacterial dominant  
**[0:55:53-0:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  to something that's closer to imbalance, fungal to bacterial?  
**[0:55:57-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  You know, only from what I've heard from Australia, where they saw about year eight into the system,  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  they start to exhaust that weed seed bank.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:09):**  Having the cover on the soil, rolling those covers is very helpful in keeping weeds down.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:15):**  We saw that in Wilcox.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:18):**  And we have an aerial of that and we were looking at where they've applied the conventional  
**[0:56:23-0:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:23):**  synthetic fertilizers.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:25):**  The weed pressure was much heavier in that treatment than it was in either the beam with  
**[0:56:30-0:56:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:30):**  the 15% or the beam only.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:32):**  And beam is biologically enhanced agricultural management.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  It's just using, restoring biology into the system.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  But we noticed from an aerial significant weed pressure from the use of the synthetic  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:45):**  fertilizers.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  You kind of shoot yourself on the foot because as you apply the fertilizers, it makes it  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:51):**  a soil more amenable to weed growing in it.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:57):**  The weeds are, they serve a purpose.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:00):**  They're there trying to restore that soil.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  And you can watch the different sequences as you improve the soil that you'll move from  
**[0:57:07-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  one weed to another.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  Like here in the desert, if you go out and scarify the soil, you'll have tumbleweeds  
**[0:57:16-0:57:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:16):**  for three years.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:18):**  And after that, another weed will come in to help restore that soil.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  But those seeds are out in the desert.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  And yet that desert, if it's undisturbed, they don't germinate.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:31):**  And yet when you come in and disturb that system, you see that the tumbleweeds will  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:35):**  germinate and they're voracious in growing.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  It's amazing what a tumbleweed can do in a shorter time.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:43):**  But it's as you keep the covers on the soil, you have a complete community of micro arthropods  
**[0:57:51-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:51):**  and they're eating those weed seeds up.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  That's another thing.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  The different parts of this system, the micro arthropods and their function, the beneficial  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:03):**  insects and their function in the system, as you bring all these back into the system,  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:09):**  it starts to function properly.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  We've come in and we've cut it off here or cut it off there, create a problem.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  So this is where the observation comes in.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:20):**  We were talking to some cotton farmers in Turkey and they were having a red mite problem.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  Well, they're also having thrips.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:28):**  Well, there's thrips that feed on the red mite population and the eggs that the red  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:35):**  mites lay.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  So you have to start developing that beneficial insect community as well in this system.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  It's an elegant system.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  It's really neat to study and see how things work when they work properly.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  But we need to allow that to move forward and to promote that as much as we can in our  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  agriculture.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  I see people listening to this or growing annual vegetables in a system where you have  
**[0:59:01-0:59:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:01):**  a crop go in and you're rotating it out, the next crop goes in.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:06):**  Is this crop rotation, if you're pretty on in terms of your timing where one crop comes  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:10):**  out, next crop goes in, is that enough, quote, permanent cover?  
**[0:59:15-0:59:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  Or do you think you could go even further for vegetable farmers, like having a perennial  
**[0:59:22-0:59:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  cover crop growing in addition to the vegetables?  
**[0:59:24-0:59:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:24):**  Or is the rotation of vegetables sequentially enough to get the above ground part working

**[0:59:34-0:59:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:34):**  Well, we see Singing Frog Farms in California.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:39):**  They do six, seven different successive crops on their land.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  And they're seeing that they come in with sets, but they'll cut the other vegetable  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  previous vegetable off at the surface, leave the root in the soil, and just plant the next  
**[1:00:01-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:01):**  vegetable crop into that soil.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  And they're being very successful at it.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:05):**  And it's enough to pump them out of carbon into the soil for those organisms to survive.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:12):**  It looks like they were having to apply compost before, but I think they've moved away from  
**[1:00:19-1:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:19):**  that and they've completely restored that system and that community.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:23):**  For now, it's pretty much self-supporting as far as the carbon flow, the energy flow,  
**[1:00:29-1:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:29):**  as long as you have something growing.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:31):**  What have you seen with your research with the theme of just that?  
**[1:00:34-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:34):**  Do you think you can get to the point where you can get off compost or if not, can you  
**[1:00:42-1:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  get down to that two pounds per acre level?  
**[1:00:47-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:47):**  Can you get the system where it just grows itself and you are never making compost again  
**[1:00:54-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  to improve it?  
**[1:00:55-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  You might make compost because you have the gas around and you need something.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  I think if you're just using it for commodity crops, you will have to inject every time.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  When I put it down at 400 pounds per acre and I kept a crop growing, I never had to  
**[1:01:11-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:11):**  add again.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  And I kept seeing year after year after year of successive increase in growth.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:17):**  We saw a five times increase after the first year and we saw another five times increase  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:24):**  from that year to year six.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:31):**  If you put it on heavy and keep it covered, keep something growing, I don't think you'd  
**[1:01:34-1:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  ever have to apply again.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:36):**  But if you're using it in a commodity crop where you have row cropping and you're putting  
**[1:01:41-1:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  it in such low amounts, I think you would have to keep doing that until you could build  
**[1:01:49-1:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:49):**  your soils up.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:50):**  And that would involve having covers in between or breeding and grazing in.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  But if you're putting it that light, I think you would have to do it every time.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:01):**  That's research that we want to do, but we haven't got the funding to do that yet.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:08):**  We're working on some other projects right now.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  Do you have any thoughts on soil mineralization of let's say annual crops where you're exporting  
**[1:02:18-1:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:18):**  biomass from one property somewhere else?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:22):**  And if you're not reapplying some sort of biomass to reintroduce minerals, are you exporting  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  minerals from your soil enough to detrimentally harm the soil?  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:34):**  Or do you think that there's enough minerals in the soil, the more biologically active  
**[1:02:38-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  the soil is, it can mine it from the bedrock, all the little bits of rock and things like  
**[1:02:46-1:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  that in the soil.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:48):**  So this idea of remineralization maybe isn't as important as some people might emphasize?  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  As long as you have the biology and along those elements are there in that soil parent  
**[1:02:58-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:58):**  material, they can be extracted by the microbes.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  That's how this planet developed.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:05):**  We take such small amounts out, what 96% of it that we pull off of a field is either carbon,  
**[1:03:14-1:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:16):**  All of those have been gases at one time and you're pulling them in as a gas.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:20):**  They're in the atmosphere, they're freely available.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:24):**  The other elements, you are pulling some out, but it's such a small amount.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:29):**  And like phosphorus, we have probably over 40 years supply of phosphorus that we've dumped  
**[1:03:36-1:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  in the soils that's inaccessible to a plant because there's not the right biology there  
**[1:03:40-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:40):**  to make it available.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  Due to soil physical chemistry, the phosphorus gets locked up and the plant can't access  
**[1:03:49-1:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  it unless it has the right microbe.  
**[1:03:52-1:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:52):**  We saw 15 species of phosphorus solubilizers in this compost develop in soils where we  
**[1:04:01-1:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:01):**  had applied the compost.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:03):**  So pretty much if the element is there, it can be extracted by the microbes.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  We even see that one microbe can extract gold from soils.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  And if it can do gold, possibly the most impervious to break down, metal, if they can do gold,  
**[1:04:24-1:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  they can do pretty much anything.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:26):**  I qualify this as long as you have the nutrients there.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:29):**  In some cases, like the soil we're working with on one research project, they don't have  
**[1:04:36-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  selenium and they don't have molybdenum.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  Molybdenum is very important in nitrogen fixation.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:41):**  It's a co-factor in the enzyme for fixing nitrogen.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:46):**  We also see selenium is very important for immune systems in plants and how they react  
**[1:04:57-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  to other organisms trying to attack them, even viruses.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  So if it's there, I believe then the microbes could mine it.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:10):**  If it's not there, you may have to supplement.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  And I usually will do a total elemental analysis on the soils that I start to work with just  
**[1:05:19-1:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:19):**  to see if there's any underlying issues of one element missing.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:23):**  So critical, like molybdenum.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:26):**  If you don't have that, hamstring your ability to fix nitrogen.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:32):**  That's key in this system is having those organisms function properly.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:35):**  I know when nitrogen is fixed, it's expensive in terms of carbon.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:40):**  Maybe it's like 10 to one, I forget the exact ratio.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:43):**  12 units of carbon for one unit of nitrogen.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:47):**  Does that give some credence to this idea of growing a nitrogen fixing plant with another  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:53):**  type of plant?  
**[1:05:54-1:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  If you think of this, sister's example, beans grown with corn, with squash.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:59):**  Beans are fixing nitrogen.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  The nitrogen fixation process requires a lot of carbon to make that happen.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:06):**  Maybe the bean can't produce enough itself.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:09):**  So now you have another plant, corn and or squash, which is pumping out its own source  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:14):**  of carbon into the soil around those beans.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:19):**  Does it make sense to have a nitrogen fixer and a non-nitrogen fixer paired together to  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  make sure there's enough carbon in the soil or is the biology just going to do that?  
**[1:06:30-1:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:30):**  I think I've always gone with mixed species, multi-species covers.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:35):**  Just to try to take advantage of that synergy that develops between plants is really interesting  
**[1:06:43-1:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  research done in Canada.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:45):**  They compared multi-species covers to a single species, triticale.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:51):**  You can see in the triticale, they didn't get a lot of rain.  
**[1:06:54-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:54):**  In the triticale, it didn't get a bit calf high.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  Yet, in the multi-species mix, same amount of water, when the fields were right next  
**[1:07:01-1:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:01):**  to each other, you had a cover crop that was above your needs.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:08):**  How these plants work in synergy together is another great thing that we need to explore.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:17):**  They help each other in many ways in the flow of that energy and the utilization of water.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:25):**  You're seeing an increase in above-ground biomass with the bean approach.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  Does quality of product move linearly with that?  
**[1:07:39-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  Sometimes a big blueberry looks good, but it doesn't necessarily taste as good as a

**[1:07:46-1:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:46):**  Do you see plants growing big and expressing their genetic potential how they should, or  
**[1:07:53-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:53):**  are they growing big at the expense of, say, whatever commercial goals we might have for  
**[1:07:59-1:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  that plant?  
**[1:08:00-1:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:00):**  Yeah, there's no comparison on tomatoes.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:05):**  We did 62 pounds of tomatoes on one tomato plant in this stuff, just playing around.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  The taste, of course, commercial tomatoes have no taste.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:17):**  We're starting to look into the nutrient availability.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:24):**  The tests are very expensive, so it's something that we're working towards now.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  We have some things going, but that would be the next step.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:35):**  If you're growing more biomass, does it have more nutrients in it?  
**[1:08:40-1:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  Is it more nutrient dense?  
**[1:08:42-1:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:42):**  That's a great question.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:43):**  I can't answer that one yet.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  All I know is that we have much higher sugar content in these plants.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  I know that the cows, when they see these plants, they will make a beeline towards them  
**[1:08:59-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:59):**  as compared to your regular pastures.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  Cows are pretty smart, very selective.  
**[1:09:07-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:07):**  They'll test all the different available plants in a field before they'll go graze.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  They know.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:14):**  So higher sugar means more efficient rate of photosynthesis and or more photosynthesis?  
**[1:09:20-1:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:20):**  Yes, it's directly correlated to photosynthetic plants because you're making sugars.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:27):**  Everything on this planet is made from sugar.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:30):**  That's the original building block for everything on this planet.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  Every protein, every fat.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  It's interesting that it all comes from sugar.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:43):**  So if you have an above ground portion of a plant that is struggling, what's happening  
**[1:09:50-1:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:50):**  below ground that's potentially causing that?  
**[1:09:54-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:54):**  Let's assume it's not under insect attack.  
**[1:09:56-1:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  There's no herbicide or anything like that.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:58):**  Let's just say it's poor biology.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  At the root soil interface, what are some things that might happen below ground that  
**[1:10:08-1:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  would negatively affect what's happening above ground?  
**[1:10:11-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:11):**  Oh, just not having a complete community there to do what needs to be done, kind of like  
**[1:10:19-1:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  a factory.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:22):**  If you're manufacturing cars and a few of your workers don't show up, it stops the whole

**[1:10:29-1:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  It's having all the organisms there to function in what job they do.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:38):**  Nature won't always pick the same because a lot of these organisms have multiple capabilities.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:44):**  A lot of your pseudomonas, they have several capabilities in carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling,  
**[1:10:54-1:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  phyto-hormone production.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  Just having the community there that can do the job essentially.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:03):**  If there's no other issue, if there's nothing wrong with the chemical or the elemental component  
**[1:11:11-1:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  of the soils, if it's just the biology, then it's probably just not having the right microbes  
**[1:11:16-1:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:16):**  there.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:17):**  Because I think a lot of people miss this.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:18):**  I think they think the root goes down and it just sucks up whatever it needs out of  
**[1:11:24-1:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  the soil, but it needs something in the soil to present to the root and then there's an

**[1:11:32-1:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  Is that what's probably potentially missing?  
**[1:11:36-1:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:37):**  It's our own perception of us.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:41):**  We don't realize that cell count, we're 90% microbial as a human.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:49):**  Gene count, we're less than a tenth of a percent human.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:52):**  It's predominantly microbes.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  It's what makes us up and what makes us operate.  
**[1:11:56-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:56):**  It's the same thing for the plant.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  I think the plant is our artificial experiment one for microbes, artificial intelligence.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  It wasn't mobile enough so it tried us.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  We're number two and kind of went awry somewhere on us.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:16):**  If you think humans, a lot of people in studies have now shown that there's a direct link  
**[1:12:22-1:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:22):**  between health and the amount of gut flora that you have and the diversity of gut flora.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:30):**  Have you seen enough in terms of observation and data to say that plants grown in the healthier  
**[1:12:37-1:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:37):**  soils in your trials are more resistant to pest pressure and or disease?  
**[1:12:43-1:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:43):**  No doubt.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:44):**  Other people, their research that they've done, the higher Brix, actually insects don't  
**[1:12:50-1:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  like a higher Brix plant or a higher sugar content cell.  
**[1:12:53-1:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:53):**  They will avoid.  
**[1:12:54-1:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:54):**  Usually insects are attacking the distressed plants, those that are having trouble.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:04):**  There's research that I've seen that pretty much demonstrates the healthier the soil is,  
**[1:13:09-1:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  the healthier plant is, the less impact that you'll have from insects.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:14):**  Same thing with fungal diseases, blight and things like that and tomatoes where maybe  
**[1:13:19-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  they're very susceptible at a certain time of year in the poor soil but this could increase  
**[1:13:24-1:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  their resistance.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:26):**  What I noticed when I was first starting doing this, we were in a greenhouse with another

**[1:13:39-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:39):**  We noticed that an extract of this did as well as any of the fungicides that they were

**[1:13:47-1:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  What you're doing is you're bringing back what I see as a competitive innovation.  
**[1:13:51-1:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:51):**  You're bringing back a healthy community that can repel any particular organism being dominant  
**[1:14:00-1:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:00):**  like phantophthora.

**[1:14:03-1:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:03):**  Also if you'll dip seed potatoes in this or dip a tree that you're going to transplant,  
**[1:14:10-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:10):**  you get a better transplant or you get a reduction in the attack by different fungi in the system.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  It's like us.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:20):**  We depend on that diversity in our microbiome for our health and the soils are the same

**[1:14:28-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:28):**  It depends on that diversity.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  As I say, it's competitive innovation.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:33):**  Everybody keeps each other in check instead of having a niche that gets destroyed like  
**[1:14:38-1:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:38):**  you put an insecticide in there and it kills a certain niche of microbes and causes a problem  
**[1:14:44-1:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:44):**  because other organisms will move into that niche.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:48):**  If they're pathogens, then you've got a problem.  
**[1:14:51-1:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:51):**  But if you have a whole community of interacting microbes that keep each other in check but

**[1:16:04-1:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:04):**  So I think it's more having the environment, having all the players there that can really  
**[1:16:13-1:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:13):**  bring the mycorrhizal community up.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:15):**  You can try a test area and see if it helps.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20):**  I always recommend that to farmers, you know, try a small test area and see if you get any  
**[1:16:26-1:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:26):**  benefits from it.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:29):**  For the most part, I think they're there.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:31):**  They just don't have the right environment to survive in.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34):**  They need the helper microbes, just like all of us depend on somebody else in this society  
**[1:16:41-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:41):**  for production of a good or to buy what we do.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  So it's the same thing in the soil.  
**[1:16:50-1:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:50):**  It's a biological barter, so to speak.  
**[1:16:53-1:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:53):**  And having all the organisms there, some of them can start to thrive that couldn't before.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01):**  That would be your mycorrhizal.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  Try it in a small area, see if it works.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:04):**  Are there any ways for people to kind of see where their soils are at now?  
**[1:17:12-1:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:12):**  Say they think they have good results now.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:16):**  And they think, oh, my vegetables are growing great.  
**[1:17:19-1:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:19):**  I have great tomatoes, I have great lettuce in the field.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:22):**  They're wondering, okay, could it be better?  
**[1:17:24-1:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  Is the best thing to do, you got to try it?  
**[1:17:27-1:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:27):**  Or is there some sort of test?  
**[1:17:29-1:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:29):**  Can you see this under a microscope?  
**[1:17:30-1:17:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:30):**  Can you send a sample soil somewhere to say, okay, where is my community?  
**[1:17:36-1:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:36):**  From what I've observed as a molecular biologist, I don't see a good test yet.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:42):**  I see a lot of looking at fungal to bacterial ratio through microscopy.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:51):**  You can get such varied results that you can't really make heads or tails of what's going  
**[1:17:57-1:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:57):**  on.  
**[1:17:58-1:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:58):**  It's blatantly obvious, yeah.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  But I've sent the same compost sample in and had to analyze three times.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:09):**  And I got three different results going from bacterial dominant to fungal dominant.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:13):**  So that scares me away from, it is helpful.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:21):**  Phospholipid fatty acid analysis.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:24):**  The originators of that test to look at the microbial makeup of that system, say do not  
**[1:18:33-1:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  use it for a fungal to bacterial ratio.  
**[1:18:35-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:35):**  So you can use it for change over time, but not as a good comparison because they depend  
**[1:18:40-1:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  on phospholipid fatty acids.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:43):**  And we've put certain groups of phospho fatty acids into one group saying they're fungal  
**[1:18:50-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:50):**  based and some bacterial based.  
**[1:18:53-1:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  But there's bacteria that produce the fungal phospholipid fatty acids and there's fungi  
**[1:18:59-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:59):**  that produce the bacterial.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  So it's not a great test for doing fungal to bacterial ratio.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:08):**  I think the science is still weak in that area.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:14):**  I know my wife puts it this way, that there's not one single test that lets us know if we're  
**[1:19:21-1:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:21):**  healthy as a human being.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:23):**  We have to go through a series of analysis in order to really maybe even then figure  
**[1:19:29-1:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  out what's wrong with us.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:31):**  I think we know more about humans than we do about soils, so we're way far behind as  
**[1:19:38-1:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:38):**  far as being able to diagnose the health of the soil.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:41):**  You think it's worth the average person, farmer, to get a microscope and look at their...  
**[1:19:48-1:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:48):**  Yes.  
**[1:19:50-1:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:50):**  Just the realization, looking at the life in that soil, realizing it's a living organism.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:00):**  That kind of puts the perspective into that, well, maybe I need to treat this different.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  Seeing that much life and that much activity going on in the soil, it's eye opening for  
**[1:20:17-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:17):**  a lot of people to see all that activity.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  Another thing that I think a lot of people maybe judge their soil quality on, if you  
**[1:20:26-1:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:26):**  send it in for a soil test, the number that comes back is there's an organic matter percentage  
**[1:20:31-1:20:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:31):**  on there and a lot of people hang their hat on.  
**[1:20:35-1:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:35):**  I have.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:36):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:37):**  Is that potentially misleading?  
**[1:20:41-1:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:41):**  The second part of that would be, is there a percentage of organic matter that's too  
**[1:20:48-1:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:48):**  much?  
**[1:20:49-1:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:49):**  If you have too much organic matter, biology isn't consuming it fast enough.  
**[1:20:57-1:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:57):**  That might say, okay, well, there's a bad problem.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:59):**  You're just dumping organic matter onto something that just can't eat it quick enough.  
**[1:21:04-1:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:04):**  What are your thoughts around percentage of organic matter in relation to soil health?  
**[1:21:08-1:21:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:08):**  Is there an upper limit where there could just be too much?  
**[1:21:11-1:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:11):**  Yeah, it's not that simple.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:15):**  What I've seen as far as soil carbon, a lot of farmers, just anecdotal evidence, seen  
**[1:21:24-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:24):**  how their soils and how their plants respond, they're seeing a change at 3% soil organic  
**[1:21:30-1:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  carbon, soil organic matter, excuse me.  
**[1:21:33-1:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:33):**  That'd be about 1.72% soil carbon.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:37):**  They see the dynamics change in how a plant grows.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:40):**  I did a greenhouse experiment looking at change in soil carbon and change from bacterial dominant  
**[1:21:47-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:47):**  to fungal dominant.  
**[1:21:49-1:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  I saw the maximum productivity, the maximum photosynthetic capacity occur at 3% soil organic  
**[1:21:59-1:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:59):**  matter, same place that farmers are.  
**[1:22:04-1:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:04):**  I think there's some truth to, you do need a certain threshold of carbon in that system  
**[1:22:11-1:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:11):**  for it to function properly.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:12):**  It's an energy vehicle.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:13):**  It's an energy resource.  
**[1:22:18-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:18):**  It's the biology as well.  
**[1:22:20-1:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  I don't know that too much.  
**[1:22:25-1:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:25):**  We see Gabe Brown hitting 8, 10%, up to 12% in some of his soils.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:34):**  I've not seen a problem.  
**[1:22:36-1:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:36):**  He had five inches of rain each year for the last three years on his pastures, and yet  
**[1:22:43-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:43):**  we went to visit him in July and he had grasses up over the hood of his four by with five  
**[1:22:50-1:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  inches of rain.  
**[1:22:51-1:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:51):**  These completely changed the dynamics of that soil, brought the carbon back, brought the  
**[1:22:56-1:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:56):**  soil biology back.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:00):**  To have a system that efficient that he could use five inches and produce that much forage  
**[1:23:07-1:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:07):**  out on a pasture is amazing.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:10):**  Most people struggle with getting forage grown, but his, with the grazing management that  
**[1:23:16-1:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:16):**  he uses and how he treats the land.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:20):**  He has some impressive results.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:24):**  For as good as his soil is, do you think he, his soil could benefit from some of the extracts  
**[1:23:33-1:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:33):**  that you talked about or buying this fungal?  
**[1:23:36-1:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:36):**  I'm trying to catch up with Gabe.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:44):**  Since he has the grazing, you don't need this if you have grazing.  
**[1:23:49-1:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:49):**  I'm just trying to emulate what nature did and what he's doing, what Will Harris is doing,  
**[1:23:55-1:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:55):**  Alejandro Creo.  
**[1:23:56-1:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:56):**  All of them can outperform me with the animals.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:01):**  We can do pretty well.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:03):**  We can definitely restore and regenerate these soils in agriculture with this system.  
**[1:24:09-1:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:09):**  Where it might be useful in a grazing context is if you are, some of the earlier examples  
**[1:24:14-1:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:14):**  you had, you're starting with a poor pasture or a limited species pasture and you're trying  
**[1:24:20-1:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:20):**  to move that along quicker.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:22):**  In addition to your rotational grazing, you could introduce some of this compost to help  
**[1:24:28-1:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:28):**  get that inoculate going, get the flywheel moving in the system.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:31):**  But once it's going.  
**[1:24:33-1:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:33):**  Yeah.  
**[1:24:34-1:24:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:34):**  As I said, the cattle with grazing makes everything go forward.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:41):**  It will help maybe.  
**[1:24:43-1:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:43):**  We're starting to look at some inoculations in grazing management, but the jury is still  
**[1:24:50-1:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:50):**  out on it as to what the impact is.  
**[1:24:53-1:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:53):**  Putting this all together, for people watching along with this at home, I think the big takeaways  
**[1:25:00-1:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:00):**  for me are one, slow down on your composting.  
**[1:25:05-1:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:05):**  Maybe change your process to get more diverse compost that maybe errors on the fungally  
**[1:25:11-1:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:11):**  dominated side.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:12):**  I'm gathering a lot of soils are probably maybe more bacterial dominated.  
**[1:25:17-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:17):**  Oh yeah, we're very bacterial dominated is the problem.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  We don't have the fungi.  
**[1:25:26-1:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:26):**  Which is I think a big misnomer.  
**[1:25:28-1:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:28):**  I think a lot of people have this assumption that trees, tree crops need fungi and herbaceous  
**[1:25:36-1:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:36):**  plants need a bacterial dominated soil.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:39):**  And maybe that's true for some herbaceous plants, but not the ones we typically grow.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:46):**  Normally from what Lane Ingram has shown, it's about a one to one fungal to bacterial  
**[1:25:51-1:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:51):**  ratio and we're sitting in ours at.03.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  So we are very bacterial dominated in our agricultural soils here.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:00):**  It's practically no fungi in the system.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:04):**  So get some fungi back into the system, restore that biology and then keep some sort of little  
**[1:26:09-1:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:09):**  living cover on surface to keep bringing nutrients and exudates and sugars down into that system  
**[1:26:17-1:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:17):**  and then just kind of watch it go.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:21):**  Step back.  
**[1:26:22-1:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:22):**  Resist.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:23):**  Don't try to do anything.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:26):**  Try to just observe and maybe you can help it, but most often if you just observe, you'll  
**[1:26:34-1:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:34):**  figure out what you need to do next.  
**[1:26:37-1:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:37):**  If you found that that's a curse and maybe you have that too of we want to try and do  
**[1:26:41-1:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:41):**  too much, the human wants to try and move it along.  
**[1:26:44-1:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:44):**  You pick up any agricultural catalog and the amount of soil amendments and things you can  
**[1:26:49-1:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:49):**  pour onto your soil is insane where yes, we need to maybe steward or kickstart this along  
**[1:26:57-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:57):**  to undo a lot of what we started, but it really is just at some point, it's just time and  
**[1:27:05-1:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  good stewardship.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:06):**  It's hard to resist trying to do something.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:11):**  Hey, you want to build a bioreactor, a Johnson-Sue bioreactor, they can look up your video, find  
**[1:27:19-1:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:19):**  plans of that online.  
**[1:27:21-1:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:21):**  Where can people go to learn more about the work that you're doing?  
**[1:27:25-1:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:25):**  I suggest California State University, Chico.  
**[1:27:29-1:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:29):**  They have a center for regenerative ag and resilient systems and they have a lot of good  
**[1:27:36-1:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  speakers on there, a lot of good videos.  
**[1:27:39-1:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:39):**  The process for building this, there's a lot of people that have registered on that site.  
**[1:27:45-1:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:45):**  I definitely suggest the center for regenerative ag and resilient systems at Chico, California.  
**[1:27:51-1:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-03-DavidJohnson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:51):**  Perfect.

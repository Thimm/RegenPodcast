### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Adding live microbes to the soil, does it actually make sense?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  Intuitively, we might think yes, but what are you actually adding to the soil?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  It's a question that you need to know the answer to.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  Because while you might be adding something beneficial to the soil, there's also a pretty  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  good chance that you might be adding something worthless to the soil, or even worse, something  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  that's harmful to the soil.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  Today I'm talking to Dr. Jane Fyfe from 3 Bar Biologics about microbials and soils.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  She's going to answer questions like, does it make sense to add live microbes to the  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  soil?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  What's the best way to deliver those microbes?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:02):**  And what type of expectations should you have if you're adding these microbes to the soil?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  Let's get those questions answered and many more with Dr. Jane Fyfe of 3 Bar Biologics.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  If you look at the, I'll call it the old school approach or a lower tech approach, if it's  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  you had any biological product, anything out there.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  In the past, they would just be, you'd have to either apply it as a seed coat and then  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  plant the seed with it already on it, or you'd have to plant it and then spray the soil surface  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  and let it percolate through and hope it makes contact.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  Looking at both those options, a seed coat and say a soil surface spray, when it comes  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  to biologicals, what are the limitations of those application methods?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  And when I talk about biologicals, recognize there's a huge umbrella of biological products.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  And what I'm talking about really is the microbial biologicals.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  So these are living, they include either bacteria or fungi.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:12):**  In some of the challenges there with say for seed treatment is, you know, for treatments  
**[0:02:18-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  that are done way by manufacturers way up in the supply chain, right, that's, you know,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  months in advance that the microbes are applied to the seed.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  And that can be challenging to maintain viability of those microbes on the seed for, you know,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:35):**  many months potentially.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  So that's one challenge.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  And it's a limitation because it limits the types of microbes that are being put on as  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:43):**  seed treatments.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  Basically it limits it to, in the case of bacteria, bacteria that form spores.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  So these are bacillus strains, which are most commonly found as seed treatments.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:55):**  But there's a whole wide range of different bacteria that don't form spores.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  And it really limits their ability to be applied as a seed treatment back at the manufacturer,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  right.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  In terms of the farmer, you know, with seed treatments, you have a lot of chemistry on  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  there as well.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  So, you know, whatever the seed package is, you know, you're kind of stuck with what that  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  is.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:22):**  So the ability to apply a biological later, potentially closer to time of use, can widen  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  the range of microbes that are possible to put on the seed.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  You do have to be mindful of the chemistry that's on the seed to make sure that there's  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  compatibility that it's not going to harm the microbes.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  But it gives the farmer a lot more flexibility if they're applied closer to time of use versus  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:51):**  being treated far in advance.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  The other, like I had talked about, in-furrow delivery, it gives the farmer a lot of flexibility.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  So they're not having to make decisions on seed treating well in advance.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  They can make decisions, you know, as they go out that day, right.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  What are they going to put in their tank mix and gives them flexibility on biologicals  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  as well as, you know, insecticides, fungicides.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  So there's kind of, you have to understand both the impact on the microbes, but then  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  also the flexibility to the farmer for using these types of products.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  When you look at plant growth enhancing microbes or beneficial microbes that are either, maybe  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  they help reduce disease pressure, maybe they help actually stimulate growth.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  How much does that spectrum open up when you can go to a just-in-time application approach  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  versus a spore seed coat approach?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  It opens up tremendously.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  And this is where, you know, you look at decades of research, decades of research in finding  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  these plant growth promoting bacteria and fungi, but very limited commercialization.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  And part of that reason comes back to the stability of the living microbe and by, you  
**[0:05:18-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:18):**  know, being able to use them, you know, closer to the farm gate where they haven't been put  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  on as a seed coat.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  That can open up the number of bacteria.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  And a lot of the discovery work that happens, and this is at universities, at, you know,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  companies big and small, there's a tremendous amount of discovery work going on right now.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  And roughly three quarters of the bacteria just kind of through discovery work are what's  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  called gram-negative bacteria.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  So if you go into the research literature and you look, nearly three quarters are, you  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:59):**  know, these non-spore forming bacteria.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  And the reason is they're so ubiquitous in the soil.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  They're everywhere.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:05):**  They associate with the plants readily.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  So when you're doing, you know, you're looking at the soil and the plant and the bacteria  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:13):**  that's associated with it, what you find is a lot of these bacteria that are hard to get  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  into a product form.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:20):**  And so, you know, that's one of the reasons the company that I work with, 3 Bar Biologics,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:28):**  we wanted to find a way to better deliver these microbes so that more of them that were  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:34):**  discovered in research could be made into product because they're just so hard to get  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  into a stable product form.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  But we're seeing more and more of these microbes being discovered.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  And so how do you work on getting them into a product form?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:47):**  And that's really kind of the Achilles heel of the industry right now in an area we're  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  working in.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  In 3 Bar, the company you work for, 3 Bar Biologics, that came out of OSU and a lot  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:57):**  of the research that was being done there.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  Can you talk about some of the research that was taking place at Ohio State and how that  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  led to the company?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  You know, and so, like I said, this discovery research, you know, it usually starts with,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  you know, soil samples, samples from plants, and you start to look at, you know, what's  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  associated with it.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:18):**  And then you screen out microbes that can really provide a good benefit to the plant,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  right?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  And through this work at Ohio State, and there's, you know, many, many land-grant universities  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  in the United States and all over the world that are doing this kind of research, and  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  several researchers at Ohio State had found, you know, a number of strains that could provide  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  benefit to plant health.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  They were all gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria, like I had said, these bacteria  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  that are really hard to get into to stabilize.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  And so it was through that kind of realization of, you know, all this great research is being  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  done, but, you know, products aren't being developed.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  You know, we're not getting these great potential from the microbes into the hands of farmers.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  And so that was really kind of why the company was founded, was on the premise of, you know,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  there's got to be a better way to get these microbes into a product, into the hands of  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  farmers.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  And so we developed the technology to do that.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  We call it our live microbe technology, but it was really out of that realization that,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  you know, here's these great microbes, but to get them to the farmer, we're going to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  have to do this a different way.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  How challenging is it to just multiply out those microbes?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  So you know they exist in the soil, they're beneficial.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  And even if we forgot commercialization and we just said, hey, I want to, I have a lab  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  here or I have the most basic equipment that any farmer would have possible.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  How easy is it to take those and multiply out the ones you want and then just get them  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  into a large enough quantity that you can then go apply them on the field?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  Even if we take out like, hey, we're not trying to sell it, we're not trying to commercialize  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  it, what I'm getting at is I think a lot of farmers would love to do that.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  How complex actually is that?  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  Yeah, so it sounds easy.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:16):**  You can grow a lot of microbes, but maybe not the ones you necessarily want.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  So you know one of the challenges in, you know, growing microbes is making sure that  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  you're doing it in a, what we call aseptic manner.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:31):**  So you're doing it in a way that you're starting with everything sterile, you're adding the  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  microbes that you want and growing them.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  And in the lab, that's, you know, fairly straightforward to do.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:44):**  Those trained in microbiology do it quite well.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  But for a novice or somebody that's not familiar with the art, it can be more challenging because  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:53):**  you can contaminate something so easily.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  And so in general, it can be done pretty straightforward in a lab environment, but you get out on the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  farm, you're in an open system, you know, it becomes more challenging to maintain, you  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:09):**  know, to maintain a pure culture, if you will.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  You know, so you don't really know what you're getting.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  You're probably multiplying something, what that is, right?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  It could be pathogens, right?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  So you don't want to multiply pathogens.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  So yeah.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:21):**  One microbial product that I think a lot of farmers have had access to in the past, it's  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  like a powder, you know, whether it's mico something usually is in the name, and there's  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  a powder there.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:33):**  Are those the non gram negative bacteria?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:37):**  Are those the spore forming bacteria?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  That's what would be in those powders?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  In some cases, yes.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  And thank you for bringing up the dry formulation.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  Because the microbes will survive, they basically get put into a dormant state.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:55):**  So when they're dry like that, that you kind of put them to sleep.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  And so both the spore form as well as the non spore forming bacteria can be made into  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:06):**  a dry formulation and be fine at room temperature for a period of time.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  So that's actually a really good strategy for formulation and developing a product.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  But it's really, it can be very expensive.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  Anytime you're doing further processing beyond just growing the microbes, from a manufacturing  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:24):**  standpoint it can be really, it can get more and more expensive.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  And so as a finished product, you know, those products, if they're not using kind of lower  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  tech technology to create the dry formulation, they can be kind of priced out of the market,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  if you will.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  What about efficacy in the field of a liquid applied product versus a dry formulated product?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:50):**  Do you think there's a difference there?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  Well, back to, you know, the microbes are in a dormant state when they're formulated  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  dry.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:00):**  Some of those products are wettable powders, so they'll be brought back into a liquid and  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  then applied.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  So there can be some kind of coming out of that dormancy, some lag there.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  But in general, they should work similarly, particularly if they're both delivered as  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:18):**  a liquid, if it's a wettable powder and brought back into a liquid and delivered as a liquid.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  But one of the things to keep in mind, you know, the extra handling involved with a,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:29):**  you know, with a dry formulation sometimes is an ideal.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:33):**  There's usually like having a liquid, they can just add it to their tank mix, it's a  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  little bit more readily usable.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  But in general, they both work just fine.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  I know from just looking at what 3 Bar's been doing, a lot of these microbes originated,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:50):**  you said, right out of an Ohio field, and they were isolated out of there.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:55):**  One concern that I know people have, and this has came up in episodes and other people,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  have various thoughts on this about local efficacy of microbes.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  So you get a microbe out of Ohio, and I want to use it here in California, or I want to  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:12):**  use it in Florida, I want to use it in Maine.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  Is it going to work the same in all conditions?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  Or are they that specific where in Ohio, microbe out of that field is going to work best in  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  that field in Ohio?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  There is some regionality.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  And it really comes back to, I think, understanding that not every microbe is meant to be a silver  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  bullet where it works everywhere all the time.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:41):**  Some that are coming out of conditions that say are cooler, wetter, will probably do better  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  going into conditions that are cooler and wetter, and vice versa, strains that are isolated  
**[0:13:52-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:52):**  out of places that are more arid, maybe have less drier conditions, probably do better  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  in those types of conditions.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:03):**  So there is some dependency there.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:07):**  But microbes, they can work across.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  So I think trying at least at a regional level to make sure that they work across some different  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  climates is important.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:21):**  And also the function that they give.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  Every microbe, it's not going to solve all of the problems in the field, but in targeted  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  ways they can help, say for instance, help with nutrient availability or help the plant  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:36):**  through certain abiotic stress.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:38):**  You have to kind of understand where you're applying it and why, and know that it's not  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  going to be something that's going to solve all of the problems in your field, but it  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  could help under certain conditions to improve your yield in certain areas under certain  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  conditions.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:54):**  That's a good point that you brought up there, because I think some people expect a dramatic  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  transformation like this weak, staggering plant.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  You apply it and boom, you have a redwood growing all of a sudden there.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  When it comes to realistic expectations, what should someone think about if they're considering  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:13):**  applying a beneficial growth microbe?  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  Yeah, so certainly under more controlled environments, you can set up experiments where you can see  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:23):**  kind of a half-dead plant and one that had microbes applied to it is growing quite well.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  But out in a field under conditions, varying conditions, you may not see that same kind  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  of direct response.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:40):**  But one of the things that we see with a microbe we've been using that was discovered at Ohio  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  State, it works really well under conditions where if you want to go out and plant earlier,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  it's helping that plant through kind of that early abiotic stress when it's cooler and  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  wetter.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  So in that environment, this microbe really works well and you can see some of that immediate  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  early season kind of vigor when the bacteria are used versus when they're not.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  So there's a case where certain conditions, this microbe can help the plant through that  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:15):**  kind of stress and you can see it in the early vigor.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  Will that translate to a huge increase in yield at the end of the season?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  It depends on the season, but you can at least say I saw an early vigor response, it helped  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:32):**  the plant through some of that early stress.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  And so you have to think about, understand how these products work, that they can help  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  under certain conditions, but not expect that they're going to give you a 50% bump up in  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:48):**  yield.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  It doesn't quite work out that way, but using them can help in general.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  We like to think of it kind of as a insurance policy that if the conditions are more detrimental  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  whether that's some early season flooding or some conditions that were harder to get  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  the stand up, they can help the plant through those conditions.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:14):**  So it's kind of like a de-risking, if you will.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:19):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  But if you look at all the factors that affect a crop, a really dry year, a really wet year,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:25):**  conditions, yield increase, is there one area that you say, okay, this is really a sweet  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  spot for microbes?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  Like if you look at all the research, microbes can definitely really help here.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  And then once you start getting out into other areas of yield increases, drought tolerance,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  whatever it is, they have less of an effect.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  Where's the sweet spot for microbes at this point, do you think?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  So the ones that have been isolated, we call them kind of the wild types, the naturally  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  derived, right?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  So they came out of the soil or from plant material and those microbes, they do, you  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  kind of have for plant, as a plant growth promoting microbe, kind of the laundry list  
**[0:18:22-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  of things that they can do, are fairly consistent if they're plant beneficial microbes.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  So they help with, you think of these microbes, they're little chemistry factories, if you  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:39):**  will.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:40):**  So as they associate with the plant and are fed by the plant, that's the relationship  
**[0:18:46-0:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:46):**  that forms, they're basically producing a wide range of different chemistry.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:56):**  So these metabolites that they're producing, and these could be plant hormones, they can  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:02):**  be different organic acids.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  And so it triggers this response in the plant as well.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  And so that's where that association happens that can help the plant through the abiotic  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  stress, whether that's not enough water, too much water through some flooding event, too  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:23):**  hot, too cold, and so forth.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  And also, they can be antagonistic to pathogens, right?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  So they can help with some of the biotic stress as well.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  But all of this kind of general help these microbes provide, but it does depend a little  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  bit on the strain, a lot on the strain in terms of what genes it has.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:51):**  So it's genetic makeup and what maybe it produces more organic acids.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  So it really can help in this case with maybe solubilizing phosphorus or it produces certain  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:02):**  enzymes that help with say nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  So what research, what's happening in research is trying to screen out and find kind of your  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:11):**  super performers that have those genes that are producing certain enzymes or certain plant  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  hormones or so forth to have better microbes.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:25):**  So that's what we're seeing kind of in the pipeline are better microbes.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  But these are all naturally derived.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  So when you hear, I know one of the big complaints about using living microbe products is the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:39):**  variability.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:42):**  You put them into the field and depending on there's such a wide variety of variability  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  in the field that the microbes, they have certain triggers where they're producing certain  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  chemistry and so that variability kind of compounds on itself.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:58):**  So in some cases they may not be triggered to produce a certain chemistry.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:04):**  So those are the challenges and kind of how those challenges are being overcome is through,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:11):**  really through some of the biotechnology that is, we've seen some of it in plant systems.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:19):**  We're now seeing that with microbial systems where you can do genetic engineering to make  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  sure that the function that the microbe's supposed to be providing, it's going to provide  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  that no matter what conditions it experiences when it's put in the field.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:35):**  So that's kind of the next generation of products.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  We're starting to see some of them.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  Certainly they're being researched, but that's where we're going to have better and better  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  microbes because of that.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  Do you think, if we go to the question, somebody's going to say, why do we even need these?  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:55):**  Like if they're already there, shouldn't they already be proliferating in the system?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:00):**  How much do you think agricultural methods and management practices affect these field  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:07):**  microbes?  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  For instance, if you go back into research, is there a difference between say no till  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  and till?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  Is there a difference between continued coverage where you have a cash crop and a cover crop  
**[0:22:17-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  versus where you're having fields just sit fallow where there are more favorable conditions  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  to have these microbes just proliferate in the soil.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  So sure you can add them as more of an insurance, but you're not starting from such a depleted  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  state given some methods.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  Is there a tie in between management practice and what they're seeing in the field?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  But you have to understand kind of the context of adding them into the field as a precision  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  application, which we kind of talked about there at the beginning versus really kind  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  of improving your soil health.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:56):**  And that's what's getting a lot of attention and for good reason.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:00):**  You know, in soil health, the idea is that we're getting the biology back into the field.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  So increasing the soil organic matter, making sure that you have a very diverse and active  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:16):**  biology microorganisms as well as macroorganisms like worms, things like that.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  So you have very active biology.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  So that's the goal.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:25):**  In a smaller system, it's very achievable.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  In more conventional, larger, broadacre agriculture, it's achievable.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  It just takes a lot more.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:36):**  There is a good bit of management behind it.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:38):**  So the practices, you know, you touched on tillage, right?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  In conventional practice, we've disrupted the soil a good bit.  
**[0:23:48-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  So tillage is one thing, adding, you know, fertilizers, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  It all disrupts that soil environment.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  But you want to be able to, you know, get a certain amount of biology back and continue  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:09):**  to work on improving your soil organic matter.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  And in broadacres, like I said, it's just, you know, there's strategies to do that.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  Certainly practices that are getting more attention, which is great.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:23):**  The whole area of regenerative agriculture, which is kind of the buzzword around this  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:27):**  right now.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:29):**  And so some of those strategies involve, you know, either no till or, you know, strip till,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  you know, much reduced tillage than what has conventionally been practiced.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:42):**  So cover crops.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  So you know, the goal is if you're going to have the biology getting put back, you're  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  going to have an active root system there all the time, which is where cover crops can  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  really provide benefit.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  And then, you know, adding different microbiology sources.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  So you know, manures, you know, a great source of very diverse microbiota.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  So you know, how do you get more of that into the soil, I think is the challenge, especially  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  on a broadacre.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:13):**  With microbial products, or any biological product, but microbial products, the idea,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  you know, you could try to more broadcast them, but you have such a limited amount that  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:24):**  you're trying to get into the soil that the precision application is where these products  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:29):**  are more fit better in terms of existing practices, so that you're just putting it with the plant  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  so they can provide that direct benefit to the plant.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  If you went with a microbial product, and let's say you had no constraints on application,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  like you could full access to the crop from seeding to harvest, and there was no, we're  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  throwing economics out.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  Do you think that if you looked at the whole suite of microbial products that, let's say  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:00):**  it was corn, that there could be X amount of applications of microbial throughout the  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  corn's life to get a significantly better yielding crop if you didn't have those constraints?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  Yeah, no, that's a great question.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:19):**  Certainly depending on, you know, the function that the microbes trying to provide, so you  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:26):**  know, with corn, nitrogen's a big focus, and there are nitrogen-fixing microbes that can  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  certainly help that, and can they provide the nitrogen throughout the growth cycle of  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  the plant at an amount that you're not having to bring in, you know, nitrogen through, you  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  know, foliar application or whatever, which is traditionally done during, through the  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:52):**  season.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:54):**  You could apply other microbes to provide other functions at certain times.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  I don't think I can fully answer that question.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  I think it raises a good point, but there's certainly the ability to reduce some of the  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  synthetic chemistries we're applying with the biological products and do it in a way  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  where you're providing at different time points benefit to the plant to help kind of, you  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:21):**  know, the goal with this is step change, right, that we're able to have a step change in yield,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  reduce inputs to be more sustainable, and you know, biological products, you know, have  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  gotten a lot of interest and excitement over the last few years because they're seen to  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  be able to potentially provide that step change.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  But how they're delivered, when they're delivered, you know, the research, it's just there's  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  not a lot of research to get to the reduction to practice, and a lot of times that's, you  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  know, the discovery works important, right?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  We need to discover in the interactions with the plant and the discovery that's going on  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:05):**  there, that's critical, but then also reducing it to practice in a way that you can start  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:09):**  to see some of these changes is, you know, I think equally as important to make these  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  products work better.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  When it comes to precision application, if you look at something like foliar feeding,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  how effective is that at delivering a microbial product to a plant?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  When a plant absorbs microbes through its leaves, or it gets microbes on the surface  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:34):**  of its leaves, I guess, how effective is that in doing that?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  Is it, if you apply 100, 100 are taking, is it, you apply 110 take, where is it on the  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  scale of being effective?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:48):**  Yes, again, it depends on what you're trying to achieve.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  There are some, a couple foliar applied products that I'm aware of that are very effective  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:59):**  or can be effective.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:03):**  Some produce hormones, plant hormones, and so they associate with the plant, they kind  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  of, they can get in, grow into the plant, they're called endophytes, so they associate  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  with the plant and get into the plant tissue, and then they can produce things like auxin,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  which can really help with plant, stimulate plant growth.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:27):**  There's some other microbes that do different things, but that's one that's common.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  And that can be very effective at certain growth stages if you're trying to accomplish,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  you know, stimulate that growth.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:38):**  Biopesticides, we haven't really talked about that, but biopesticides, you know, depending  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  on where the pest is, they may need to be delivered fully, you know, onto the foliar  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:48):**  tissue or potentially into a bud or somewhere where that pest might be, and so they can  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:56):**  be very effective.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  The challenge with anything kind of, you know, foliar or above ground is you then have, you  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  know, UV, the sunlight, so you do have to be mindful of how you're delivering the formulation  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:11):**  to make sure that the microbes are protected a little bit so that they're not being killed  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  by UV.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  But some of that has already, you know, been worked on through additives you can include  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  in your tank mix and so forth in the formulation, but there are products out there, certainly  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  that work, that are effective, that aren't just applied with the seed.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:33):**  I don't know if you've came across this in the precision ag space, but is there enough  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  knowledge out there now on foliar feeding?  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:42):**  So let's say we're going, moving away from biologicals for a quick sec, and I just want  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  to apply nutrients to a plant.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:49):**  Uptake of nutrients through leaves versus uptake of nutrients through roots, is there  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  a difference there?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  And when you do precision ag, if you have to apply to foliage, are you going to get  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  the same benefit as if you were injecting it to the roots or drenching the soil?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  Do you know that?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:08):**  You know, that's a little bit outside of my expertise.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:13):**  You know, I know again back to corn, you know, farmers will go out and apply foliar nitrogen  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  to, you know, get it, that boost of nitrogen at certain growth phase.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:24):**  So I don't know the efficiency necessarily, but when you think about delivery, spraying,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  anytime you spray a liquid, it's one of the most inefficient processes.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  You lose a lot through, you know, just off-target movement.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:40):**  So from an efficiency standpoint, the more precise your delivery to versus a, you know,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  more spraying can get better, you know, further coverage potentially, but you can lose a lot  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:52):**  too.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  So you got to think about, you know, how you're delivering it, you know, feeding it.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:58):**  You know, it's challenging in broad acres because you have a lot of ground to cover,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  right?  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:04):**  So spraying is pretty typical with liquid material.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  When you're going in furrow, you have a little bit more control, right?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  You can control it right into that furrow, but a good bit's wasted in furrow too unless  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  you're, you know, there are some new technologies that are turning on and off between the seeds.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:21):**  So you don't waste, if you're just laying down liquid between the seed, you're wasting  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  a good bit of material.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  So there are new equipment coming out to help kind of be less wasteful.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  Well, with a lot of biologicals, is the waste truly waste?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  If you put it in an area in between seeds, I think, okay, there's microbes in the soil.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  They'll just either go dormant in the soil or they'll just wait for the roots to eventually  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:52):**  make their way over there.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  How much of that is actually wasted when you think about a microbial product?  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  Do you need it right up on the root?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  So, great question.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  You know, the microbiology that's in the soil, you know, if you have good biology happening  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:11):**  in your soil, you probably have a decent amount of root, you know, the food for the microbes  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  is there.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  With, you know, with root systems, it's the carbon and the exudates from the plant roots  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  that are feeding the microbes.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  There's other material in the soil too, other carbon in the soil that can help feed the  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:34):**  microbes, but they're going to, you know, there's a population dynamics.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  So when there are roots around, they increase and then they eventually tail off once those,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:46):**  maybe those roots aren't there.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  So to maintain it, you know, when we apply a biological product, maintaining, you know,  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  most of those microbes will maintain with the root system, but then, you know, when  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  you harvest the plant, they kind of go away.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:03):**  So you're not changing the soil microbiome with what you added.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:10):**  If you added them to say the entire field, right, not just with the plant, you're adding  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:14):**  such a small amount and then they're competing with what's there that they're probably not  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  making a big impact either.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  And so that's where, you know, you really have to, you know, to improve your soil organic  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  matter, improve the diversity of the microbes.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  You know, it takes time.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:34):**  It doesn't happen overnight, right?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  It takes repeated applications, whether that's manure, putting cover crops in, which cover  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  crops, you know, those seeds will introduce some microbes and then you're establishing  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  a population, you're helping what is there continue to maintain and increase.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:51):**  So it does take a good bit of management and effort over time to make that community come  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:58):**  back, right?  
**[0:35:00-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  Is part of the idea behind some microbial products not reproducing in the soil that  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  they need a specific point in a plant's life to actually exist and once that point passes,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  like that's their window, it's over?  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  I think this is where a lot of people get hung up.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:19):**  They think, well, I put this in, I have a live plant growing there.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  Let's say it's a cash crop.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  I follow that up with a cover crop.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:26):**  I still have a living root in the soil.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  Why do those microbes suddenly die off?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:32):**  Why don't they proliferate and why aren't they multiplying?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:34):**  If they're originally soil born, they're not modified to just, you know, die after 90 days,  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  why don't they stay in place and why can't they naturalize and breed out?  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  Yeah, no, that's, it is, it's a great question.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  And kind of the way I think about it and I kind of segment it is, you know, you have,  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  you know, what's there in a broad, you know, in the bulk soil, right?  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:59):**  And there is microbiology there, even, you know, conventional fields that have been,  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  you know, used fertilizer, chemical fertilizers for years, that diversity and kind of level  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  of microbes in that more conventional field that's, you know, used tillage and synthetic  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  fertilizers is going to be reduced.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  You're not going to have the same diversity.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  You're not going to have the same level of microbes than one that is, you know, really  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:28):**  working on improving the soil organic matter, improving the soil health.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  And what happens when you add, you know, whether it's multiple microorganisms, there's products  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  that are, we call them consortia, but they contain, you know, multiple different species.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  You could apply a product like that.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  You could apply a single species.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:52):**  When you're introducing that, the level that you would need to introduce in a bulk soil  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  to really make a difference would be very high.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  And that would be something that's pretty expensive to do.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:04):**  And like I was saying, you know, ways that you could introduce more roots in the ground  
**[0:37:10-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:10):**  with things like cover crops, you know, that can help improve, especially if you have a  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  diversity of those cover plant species.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  That helps too, because they're bringing in with their roots some microbes.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  And each plant, you know, there's dynamics that happen with different plant species with  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  different microbes.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:34):**  And it's very complex.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  And so the idea is, you know, you're trying to build up that diversity over time and not  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  have just single either plant species or microbe species.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  You really need that diversity to be effective.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:54):**  When you introduce a product with a plant, the idea is you're just helping that plant  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  to have better quality, better yield.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:00):**  You're not trying to change the whole field.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:03):**  Changing the whole field takes a lot of management and a lot.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  You got to do a lot of different things, right?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  Is this a fair analogy?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  I get sick.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:11):**  I take penicillin.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  Suddenly my body has all this penicillin in it from the tablet that I'm taking.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  But when I stopped taking the penicillin, that penicillin is not now reproducing itself  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  in my body at those high levels.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:27):**  Maybe there's some that lingers there.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  I don't know.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  But like when I take the overload away in the form of a pill, maybe there's some residual,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  but it's not set up to live in me the way it would in that tablet.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  Well and it's a good analogy in the sense of our bodies are healthiest, right?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:48):**  When we have a diversity of bacteria in our system, right?  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  Our probiotics.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  When we try to introduce probiotics, it can help improve your health for sure, but it's  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  really that natural diversity and through health and healthy habits that you can maintain  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  it, right?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  When you try to have to introduce more, it can help locally, but it's really that diversity  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  that maintains that health.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  The same thing carries over to soil and plants as it does in our bodies.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:32):**  Probiotics certainly can help target and if you have a pathogen, introducing an antibiotic  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  certainly can help with that pathogen, but it really is maintaining that healthy system.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  That's really where the whole regenerative agriculture, soil health is headed is we want  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  to get that system back, right?  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  That we've taken away over time with some of our practices.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:59):**  I guess in a fair way, we don't want bad bacteria to be overloaded in the soil.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  If you think about it, sure, we would love to have as many of these growth enhancing  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  bacteria in the soil as possible, but how much can the natural balance actually support?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:17):**  The system can go out of whack either way and it can only support one base level.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:24):**  If we circle all the way back and we look at the research that was done at OSU when  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  3-bar came out or some of the specific bacteria and organisms in the soil that proved to be  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  interesting and said, wow, okay, there's something here, this needs to be worked on more.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  And then those were identified and hence 3-bar was born.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  So most of that early work, and mind you, the folks that are doing the discovery work,  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  this is sometimes decades worth of their research, right?  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  To find certain strains or groups of strains.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  And so that work had been going on for a good 10 years by the time 3-bar came along.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:08):**  Largely in that work, there's a grouping of beneficial bacteria from the genus Pseudomonas.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  And if you go into the research literature, many, many Pseudomonas species have been identified  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  as being good growth promoters.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  And part of the reason is because they take a lot of different food sources, so they're  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  not real picky.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  They're rapid growers, so we call them good root colonizers.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  So when the plant root system's coming out, they grow really well and they're not so picky  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  about the plant species as well.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  So they're good generalists in that sense.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  And they're found everywhere, in the soil in particular.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  And so that's the environment they know.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  So they're good candidates, but they don't form spores.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:06):**  And so that's where, just like Ohio State discovered this range of Pseudomonas species,  
**[0:42:13-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:13):**  many other examples of that from both university and industry, very few products have made  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  it to market because they just don't do well when you try to scale up, manufacture, and  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  then eventually get them distributed.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  They just don't do well.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:33):**  So most companies don't put any effort into it because they just, it's going to be too  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  hard, right?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  So that's where we decided, okay, let's figure out a way to do this.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:43):**  And so that was where the technology that we developed, which is where the microbes  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  are actually grown at the point of use versus having to go through.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:54):**  So it basically allows you to get around the issues of being in the supply chain.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:02):**  So they're fresh.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  What the farmer gets is a fresh population, just like what the researcher was doing in  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  their lab, a fresh population.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  It's kind of the way that we've approached this, which is very different from kind of  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:16):**  the traditional way to manufacture these types of products.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:19):**  Right.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:20):**  And that's your live microbe technology.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:23):**  You walk people through what that would look like if they had that on their farm, they  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:28):**  can go to the website and check out what it actually looked like, but to visualize for  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  them, describe what it is.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  So basically we talked about microbes when they're in a dry form, they kind of go dormant  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  and they stay fairly stable for a period of time.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:48):**  So that's what we start with.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  We start with the bacteria, but we only need a small amount.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  That is what we put in our cap system as part of this kind of live microbe technology.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  Then the other part of the system is liquid and nutrients.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  So we keep them in two separate chambers and it's actually, you know, when you're ready  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  to use the product, you activate it, which means you, we've made it simple to use.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  So it's basically push of a button, but then it allows the dry formulation, which has been  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  stabilized to combine with the liquid and nutrients.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:25):**  And so when that happens, basically that's when the fermentation starts because the nutrients  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  kind of come back out of that dormancy and they start to grow because they now have nutrients  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  and liquid.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  And so what that looks like is it's basically a bag and box.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:41):**  So it's very easy for the grower to use, push of a button.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  But then you can pour it once the microbes have grown, which takes about 24 hours to  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:52):**  go through a fermentation cycle.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:54):**  Then they're ready to use.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  It's all contained.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:57):**  So there's no, you know, we've produced it so that there's no contaminants.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:00):**  It's contaminant free.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  You're growing.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:03):**  You push the button.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  The microbes over 24 hours grow and then it's ready to use.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  So you take that liquid and then you can apply it.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  You can, depending on your system and how you plan to apply it, you can deliver it as  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  a liquid.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:17):**  So it's very easy to use.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  The microbes are, you know, 100% viable to start.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  They haven't been produced way upstream and gone through viability loss over time.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:31):**  So you know you're starting with, you know, a very fresh population.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  So for these gram-negative microbes like Ohio State had discovered, this is a big deal because  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  otherwise trying to get them into, you know, to be viable by the time the farmer's using  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:45):**  the product is a very big challenge.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:48):**  So this is kind of a way to do that with our system.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:51):**  Because otherwise you're shipping them a jug, probably with dry ice or something, right,  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  to keep it cooler.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:59):**  Well, one workaround.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  So the technology that we developed is a workaround for this, right, where you're growing them  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  as close to the point of use as possible.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:08):**  Another workaround is refrigeration, right.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:11):**  So yes, you can produce them and then keep them refrigerated and then ship them under  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  refrigerated conditions.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  That's very expensive, not necessarily easy.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  But it does prolong their life to be longer than at room temperature or worse if you get  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:31):**  under elevated temperature conditions.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:34):**  And the main product that 3-Bar has is biostimulant.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:38):**  Can you talk about what that product is and what's in it, what it would be used for?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:44):**  Yeah, so these plant growth promoting bacteria that we've been talking about, they can fall  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  under what's called biostimulants or bio fertilizers in some cases.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:57):**  In our case with Bio Yield, which is the first product that we commercialized from the strain  
**[0:47:01-0:47:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:01):**  we were working with with Ohio State, we know that these bacteria, they produce, like I  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:08):**  said, they produce a range of metabolites.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  So these chemistries, some of them help kind of the plant through this range of antibiotic  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17):**  stresses.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:18):**  In particular, we see, you know, this cooler, wetter soil can really help boost growth of  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:23):**  the plant through the early stages of growth in those conditions.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:27):**  It also produces organic acids, which can help with phosphorus solubilization.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  So that's one area, any nutrient solubilization in the soil, it can help with the phosphorus  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  in particular.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:45):**  Is it primarily then pseudomonas based, I guess?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  Yeah, it's a pseudomonas species, yep.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:50):**  Got it.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  And the liquid that you're using to breed it out, is that something just like a sugar  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  water?  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  I mean, simplified down, but that's a carbon source?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  Yeah, it's a carbon, definitely microbes need carbon and nitrogen, and then a range of salts.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  Most growth media that you use in the lab, you know, you can, different microbes grow  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  best on different media.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  We can optimize that in our system, but a good nutrient rich media that you would use  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:23):**  in the lab.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:29):**  When looking at this, there could be a variety of farmers, somebody who grows corn, somebody  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  who grows lettuce, somebody who grows strawberries, somebody who grows tomatoes.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  Could any of those growers look at this product and say, how could this help me?  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  Or is it really targeted towards a specific crop?  
**[0:48:51-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:51):**  We definitely have started to collect more data on different crops.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  The bacteria, these type, what I call kind of, I hate to call them generalists, but these,  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  the bacteria that are known, like pseudomonas that are known for associating with plants,  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  you know, they can provide a range of benefits that are kind of general, the abiotic stress  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  helping with nutrient uptake, and that, these pseudomonas are very, like I said, they're  
**[0:49:22-0:49:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  not picky about their carbon necessarily, so they do associate with a wide range of  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:29):**  different plant species.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:30):**  That's not always the case, but in some cases, like with some of these pseudomonas it is,  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:36):**  and so you could use them on, and we have been collecting data, strawberries, we have  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  some data, other specialty crops, tomatoes, so we continue to work it out with different  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  plants.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:51):**  But we started, we started with corn and soybeans because that was kind of where Ohio State  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  started, so that was kind of where we first went commercially.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  In right now, what's the optimum application point?  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  Is it at, is it in-furrow when you're planting?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:07):**  Is that where you see the best use of this product?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  You know, that's a great question, and that's something, where we have started is applying  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:17):**  it with the seed at planting, so that as that seed germinates and the early root system  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:22):**  forms, the bacteria are right there to grow with it, right?  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  When you're adding the bacteria to an established root system, that's something that we're actually  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:34):**  investigating right now to see how that looks compared to when you're applying it with the  
**[0:50:39-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:39):**  seed.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  The thing to remember, you know, with the precision application with the seed, you know  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:46):**  you've got a lot of microbes right around that seed, so as the root system comes out,  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:52):**  you can, the bacteria can heavily colonize it.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  When you're doing like, you know, drip, drip irrigation, things like that where you may  
**[0:51:01-0:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  have a point source or even like a soil drench, you may not be getting the microbes close  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:08):**  to the root system, they might be a couple inches away.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  With a soil drench, if you're spraying down or doing something like that, now you're diluting  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:17):**  a lot of the bacteria across a wider area, so you may not have as many to start with  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  that the roots will interact with.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:25):**  So things to think about around delivery to help these products work better.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  I mean, ideally, you know, they're made to, if you're putting them in the soil, they're  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  made to interact with the plant in the root zone, right?  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:38):**  So you want to have the bacteria at a high concentration in that root zone, regardless.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  Right.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:44):**  For crops that are transplanted, if you look at lettuce and broccoli and stuff like we  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  have out here in California, other crops like that, would it make sense to apply this in  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  a nursery setting where you can be hyper focused, you can either apply it when the seed goes  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  down or just on each little cube of soil that you have right there?  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  Yeah, no.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  I mean, I think the earlier, you know, especially for crops that are kind of vertical and they're  
**[0:52:08-0:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  going to go through a cycle, applying them probably multiple times, but early either  
**[0:52:17-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:17):**  with the transplant at a young stage, during transplant, it just depends on, you know,  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  growers don't want extra steps added.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:28):**  So it has to fit into existing practices, right?  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:32):**  So if there is, you know, in plugs, you can certainly drench it in, it's right there,  
**[0:52:36-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  it's a small volume that can work really effectively.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  You just have to make sure that as the plant goes along, if you're going to repeat applications  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  that it needs to be near that root system and not, you know, otherwise you might be  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  wasting material.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:56):**  Sure.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:57):**  With so many microbial products out there and so many people thinking of the upside  
**[0:53:03-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:03):**  and yet worrying about the downside and the cost benefit trade-off, what are questions  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  you think people should really ask or information they should look for before they seek out  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  a microbial?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:20):**  Yeah, you know, and it comes back to what do you really need?  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:26):**  You know, I think for some of the growers in California, you know, there's, those needs  
**[0:53:32-0:53:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  are different than, you know, row crop farmers in the Midwest, right?  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:39):**  So look for products that can kind of meet those needs.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:46):**  You know, for instance, you know, if drought's an issue or trying to reduce water, there  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  are microbes that are coming along and I think some on the market that can help, you know,  
**[0:53:58-0:54:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  help the plant through that abiotic stress.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:00):**  If waterings intermittent, you know, they can help maybe reduce the amount of water  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:09):**  needed.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  There's bacteria that can, you know, help the plant through some of those conditions.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:14):**  That's a need, right?  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:17):**  You know, nutrient, kind of the area where there is a lot of focus right now is in nutrients,  
**[0:54:23-0:54:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  right?  
**[0:54:24-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:24):**  Reducing particularly nitrogen and phosphorus so that we don't have the runoff and contamination  
**[0:54:31-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  issues from fields.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  So there's a lot of research going on around nitrogen being able to fix nitrogen from the  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  atmosphere.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  There's bacteria in nature that do that, but the ability to kind of amplify that and make  
**[0:54:47-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:47):**  it work.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  So there's a lot of new microbes coming out, companies spending a good bit to develop better  
**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:54):**  microbes to do that.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  I think one of the things I would caution, you know, there are, you know, there's products  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  out there that have microbes in them.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  And mostly have, you know, they've been produced and have metabolites in them probably that  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:12):**  the microbes produced during their fermentation.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  Those products, whether the microbes are alive or not, they contain a lot of metabolites  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  that can provide benefits.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:22):**  So these are bioactive compounds that the microbes produce.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:26):**  And you can see benefit, but, you know, for a living micro product, you do want the micro  
**[0:55:32-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:32):**  to provide kind of extended benefit over time if that micro is added to your system, not  
**[0:55:36-0:55:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  just the chemistry that it produced.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:38):**  You know, make sure you understand, you know, are the microbes, you know, what level are  
**[0:55:46-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  they at.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  The regulatory framework for these products is coming in the US.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  It's a little bit behind some, Europe and some other places around the world, but we  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:59):**  don't monitor the quality of products yet.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:02):**  So there are micro products that are supposed to have living microbes in them, but they  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:07):**  don't, or they have, you know, contaminants in there or other species that are in there  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  that shouldn't be.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:13):**  So the regulatory framework for that's coming, but just be mindful of, you know, what, try  
**[0:56:20-0:56:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  to understand what's in your jug, right?  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:23):**  That it may not be completely living.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  One of the tests is if it stinks really bad, you probably have microbes that are on their  
**[0:56:33-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  way out because they're, you know, they're dying.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  So it shouldn't be a bad smelling product if it's fresh and viable.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:50):**  So just some things to be mindful of when you're using these products.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  It seems like a buzzword for a lot of products and it seems like a way that is for people  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:01):**  to sell a lot of product.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:04):**  And you know, I like what you said about, you know, know what you're actually getting.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:08):**  Is it living?  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  Is it the byproducts of those microbes?  
**[0:57:11-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  Do you have any sense of how many bad players are out there?  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  Not necessarily intentional, but given that there isn't a framework to say, here's what  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  it has to be.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  And we can say they're in there and there could be one or there could be one billion,  
**[0:57:31-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:31):**  but one is still in there.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  Do you, working in this, do you feel like there is a lot of latitude around what these  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:40):**  microbial products are, where people could find themselves in danger of buying something  
**[0:57:45-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:45):**  that's more or less just junk?  
**[0:57:47-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  And honestly, that's been the issue with this industry is the perception of snake oil, right?  
**[0:57:54-0:58:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:54):**  You know, people don't really know what's in the jug and that's a problem.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:00):**  But what I can say is I think where we are now, and there's a lot of science behind the  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  products that are, you know, newly on the market, that have been on the market more  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  recently that, you know, as the frame, as a regulatory framework comes along, that's  
**[0:58:18-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  going to be the standard, right?  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  I know some of this, there's been a couple of studies that have looked at product quality.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  You know, the Department of Agriculture in Oregon, I think has taken a big lead in monitoring  
**[0:58:33-0:58:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:33):**  products in their state.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:34):**  And some of the data that they have coming out of that work is it's less than, I think  
**[0:58:41-0:58:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:41):**  it's less than 40% of products had, you know, were meeting their label in terms of numbers  
**[0:58:50-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:50):**  of the viability numbers, as well as, you know, you said you were going to have these  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  species in here and you don't, right?  
**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:59):**  So quality does come down to, you know, meeting your label limits of having so many viable  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:05):**  cells in there, as well as making sure that you have only what you say you have in there,  
**[0:59:11-0:59:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  right?  
**[0:59:12-0:59:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:12):**  You don't have contaminants, which is as you scale up manufacturing processes, that becomes  
**[0:59:17-0:59:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:17):**  more and more difficult, right, to maintain not having contaminants in there.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:24):**  And so right now the data doesn't look good.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:27):**  As an industry, it doesn't look good for us, right?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:31):**  But what I can say is there's many, many companies out there that are working to, you know, we're  
**[0:59:37-0:59:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  working on innovation and technologies to do way better than kind of what the data says  
**[0:59:43-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:43):**  right now.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  So say I go to 3bar and I end up going with your tech, I get it on the farm, I apply it.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  Realistically, how should I focus my lens so I have appropriate expectations?  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  So I think two things right out of the gate is, you know, what you're applying is fresh,  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  viable, because you just grew it.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  So you have that at least, you know what's in your jug, right, from that standpoint.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:22):**  And then being realistic about what it's meant to do.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:26):**  And so, you know, certainly our label, the early vigor and, you know, with the microbe  
**[1:00:30-1:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:30):**  we're using right now and helping with nutrient availability and uptake.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:36):**  So don't expect, I think, more than what the product's supposed to do and make sure it  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  aligns with what you need, I think are two ways to kind of level that expectation.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:49):**  And then try it.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:50):**  And I think that's been our biggest thing with, at least where we've kind of done some  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  of our proof of concept work with corn farmers in the Midwest.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  We've had some farmers that have found a fit on some of their acres and continue to buy  
**[1:01:05-1:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:05):**  it year over year, and some that haven't really seen probably the level of benefit.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:10):**  And it comes back to is it really meeting a need you have, right?  
**[1:01:15-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  So that's kind of where we start with our growers is making sure there's a right fit,  
**[1:01:22-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  have them try it, and usually try it for a couple years because of the variability you  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  get year to year with climate and so forth.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:30):**  If somebody did have a question about fit usage, do you have people that they can call  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:36):**  up and talk to and say, hey, here's what I'm trying to do, here's what I have?  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  One other thing is along that line of farmer observation, is that a big key to really advancing  
**[1:01:48-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:48):**  this industry of you need some farmers who are willing to kind of go out on a limb, take  
**[1:01:57-1:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  a chance, and do their own split testing so they can see does this work, does this not  
**[1:02:05-1:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:05):**  work?  
**[1:02:06-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:06):**  I'm going to compare it against, I'm applying it on plot A, plot B is very similar in terms  
**[1:02:10-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  of soil structure and everything else, and I'm going to look at A versus B and just see  
**[1:02:15-1:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  what happens here.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:16):**  I feel like anybody doing any amendment of significance that offers some sort of benefit  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  like this, the only way you're going to convince yourself at the end of the day is by looking  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  at, okay, I control and then applied, do I notice a difference, do I see a difference,  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  do I taste a difference, whatever that variable is.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:39):**  And that's where I think the farmers that are doing that by, they're trying different  
**[1:02:48-1:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:48):**  things, they're kind of pushing, looking at new technologies.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:52):**  I think right now where we are with biologicals, that's mainly the farmers that are kind of  
**[1:02:59-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:59):**  using them and experimenting with them.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:04):**  And it's going to take, we're at the early stages of technology adoption, right?  
**[1:03:09-1:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:09):**  So it's going to take some of that experiment on the farm to see where it fits, how it fits.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  One of the struggles I have is we're not going to have a market unless farmers are buying  
**[1:03:21-1:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:21):**  these products, right?  
**[1:03:24-1:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:24):**  And so there's farmers trying them, some early adopters, but the research, what we haven't  
**[1:03:32-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:32):**  seen necessarily with, there are some university researchers, agronomists working with these  
**[1:03:43-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  products, but not a lot.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  Education has historically kind of been where some of these new technologies get vetted  
**[1:03:51-1:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  out.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:52):**  And just kind of the nature of funding and there's not a lot of research going on.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  There's more coming down the pipeline within universities, but not a lot.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:05):**  But I think farmers rely on that research too.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:09):**  So I think more of that in the US is needed, more funding for the universities to do that  
**[1:04:17-1:04:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  I think will help strengthen the industry at large and give farmers maybe a little bit  
**[1:04:21-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:21):**  more confidence in some of these products.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  But otherwise it really is the farmers trying things, but then also the industry carrying  
**[1:04:30-1:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  a lot of the load of industry, both companies and distributors doing a lot of this testing.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:38):**  Right.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:40):**  Just looking at your crystal ball here, if you looked ahead 10 years, seeing how everything's  
**[1:04:45-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:45):**  advancing on the day to day, what do you think the biological microbial space and ag is going  
**[1:04:51-1:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  to look like?  
**[1:04:53-1:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:53):**  Yeah, I think I'm just amazed at technology is moving fast right now because we have these  
**[1:05:03-1:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:03):**  tools to utilize, right?  
**[1:05:06-1:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:06):**  Technology tools, things that have evolved very rapidly over the last 5, 10, 15 years.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:13):**  So the ability to discover and the speed of that is quickening.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  I have an example I use and I've used in a presentation before looking at kind of over  
**[1:05:28-1:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:28):**  the last 20 years, it took the screening processes of naturally occurring microbes, isolating  
**[1:05:37-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:37):**  them, work that like Ohio State did and other universities have done, screening out, figuring  
**[1:05:42-1:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:42):**  out ones that work, timelines of kind of 15, 20 plus years to get a product to market.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:49):**  And what we're seeing now with some of the industry players and applying some of these  
**[1:05:56-1:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:56):**  biotechnology tools and genetic engineering tools, that timeline is shrinking to like  
**[1:06:03-1:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:03):**  less than 10 years to do that foundational work, get a candidate, test it out and get  
**[1:06:10-1:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:10):**  it to market.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:11):**  So I think we're going to see, continue to see the acceleration of technology in this  
**[1:06:16-1:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:16):**  area, biotechnology tools being used.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:20):**  And then the big one that I think may be the step changes that we're hoping for is when  
**[1:06:28-1:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:28):**  you start to bring the plant and the microbe together more intentionally to provide that  
**[1:06:35-1:06:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:35):**  bigger advantage.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:36):**  So you're basically doing the biotechnology work both with the plant and the microbe or  
**[1:06:43-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  microbes, multiple strains to really create a system.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  I think that's where the next 10 years, we'll be talking about it more holistically as a  
**[1:06:55-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:55):**  system.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  And that research is underway in quite a few places.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:01):**  Interesting stuff.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:02):**  And for somebody who likes what you're talking about here and likes what you guys have to  
**[1:07:07-1:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:07):**  offer, what's about the rough cost per acre of application at this point?  
**[1:07:11-1:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:11):**  Yeah, it varies.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:13):**  It depends and it varies.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  One of the things we have always strived for is return on investment for the farmer.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:21):**  And so we've focused on keeping costs, trying to keep costs down.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:27):**  And so for at least what we're doing with our product with a precision application,  
**[1:07:34-1:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:34):**  right?  
**[1:07:35-1:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:35):**  So it's going with the seed at planting.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:37):**  It's roughly between $4 to $5 an acre.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:41):**  So it's fairly low cost input for a row crop farmer.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:48):**  But products certainly can get into the $20 to $30 per acre range as well.  
**[1:07:57-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:57):**  Got it.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:58):**  And if people want to learn more about everything that you guys are doing, where's the best  
**[1:08:01-1:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:01):**  place that they can go?  
**[1:08:03-1:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:03):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04):**  I mean, our website is a great place, which is www.3barbiologics.com.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  If you're just interested in these microbial types of products and what they are, biologics  
**[1:08:21-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:21):**  in general, we do have a great industry association that has a good bit of educational information.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  And that's Biological Products Industry Association, so BPIA.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:37):**  You can find that out on the internet.  
**[1:08:39-1:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:39):**  And just lots of great resources beyond that.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:43):**  So websites and whatnot that are some universities that have some educational material out as  
**[1:08:48-1:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  well.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:49):**  So it's an area that's definitely, like I said, kind of at the beginning of more utilizing  
**[1:08:57-1:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  technology.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:58):**  And these products are going to get better and better as time goes on.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:02):**  And we're just really starting to understand how to better use these products, how to better  
**[1:09:07-1:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:07):**  deliver them to make a difference.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:10):**  So if you are interested, certainly start to do some research and think about the importance.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:19):**  Don't forget the importance of how you're delivering it because you do want to make  
**[1:09:23-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  sure that what you're putting in the field is going to be effective.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-16-JaneFife-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  Thank you.

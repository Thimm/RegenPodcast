### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Clay.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  What is it?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:23):**  When it comes to soil, clay represents a few things.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  It can reference particle size and it can also reference the mineral that is clay.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  When you think about clay in the garden or on the farm, for a lot of people, there's  
**[0:00:37-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  a negative connotation with clay.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  Yet clays play a very important role within the soil, such as protecting organic matter.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  Today we're taking a deep, deep dive into all things clay with Dr. David Laird of Iowa  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  State University.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  Dr. Laird is going to be talking about how clays play a crucial role in agricultural  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  soils and how all clays aren't created equal.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  This will be the deepest dive that you've ever taken into the subject that is clay.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  Let's get into it with Dr. David Laird.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  Using what you know, what are some of the misconceptions from an agricultural producer's  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  standpoint around clay?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  First of all, clay has several meanings.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  It's defined sometimes as a particle size, just any particles that are less than what  
**[0:01:45-0:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  we call two microns, which is a little, almost too small to see.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:56):**  But it also has a meaning in terms of mineralogy, the chemistry and the structure of the atoms  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:05):**  that make up that clay particle.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:08):**  There is a whole large family of different types of clay minerals.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  They have different properties, and depending on the amount of clay and the type of clay  
**[0:02:23-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  that you have, can have a big influence on soil properties.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  So I think recognizing that clays are actually minerals, that means they have a three dimensional  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  structure, the atoms are not just randomly scattered around, they are in very specific  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  structure and that impacts the properties of the clay.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  And another area where people probably don't have fully appreciate or often appreciate  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  is that clays evolve with time on a grand scale.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  And they are hugely influenced by climate.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  So if you go down into the tropics, you'll find very different types of clays in the  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  soil down there than you will up in more temperate regions.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  Here in the Midwestern part of the US, you find what we call smectites, two to one phyllosilicate.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  These are sort of like, they have this kind of the structure of mica, flat, and they're  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  made of silicon, aluminum, magnesium.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  But you go down into the tropics, and you find a whole different group of clays that  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  are dominated by iron and aluminum oxides.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:05):**  And they have evolved as the soil weathers through the influence of climate.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  Certain cations are leached out of the clays, the clays begin to structurally reorient,  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  and you end up moving towards these oxides.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  And there is a systematic pattern or process by which this evolution weathering of clay  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  minerals occurs.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  Does that aging of clay affect agricultural productivity soils?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:50):**  In other words, if you had a predominantly certain type of clay in a soil, could you  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  suppose that all else being equal, that soil may be more productive than a different soil,  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  a different evolution of clay?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  Clays have a big influence, but there are also other factors that influence the productivity  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:13):**  of the soil.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  Clays are just one of the factors.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  But yes, the type of clay matters.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  So here again, in more temperate climates, we have, and we mentioned these smectites,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  these mica-like clays, and they tend to have high ability to retain cations, a term called  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  cation exchange capacity.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:45):**  On the other hand, if you go down to the tropics, and the oxide clays, iron aluminum oxyhydroxide  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  phases, have a much lower ability to retain cations.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  And also, they influence the pH buffering capacity, and I don't want to get too deep  
**[0:06:14-0:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  in the terminology here, but pH is how acid or basic the soil is.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:22):**  And if you add some hydrochloric acid or more acid to the system, how rapidly that pH changes,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  well the clays that we have down in the tropics are very unbuffered.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  They can become very acidic very quickly, whereas the clays we have in temperate regions  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  resist change in pH.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:48):**  So a farmer adds ammonium forms of fertilizer, very critical for crop growth.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  Nitrogen exists in ammonium and nitrate forms.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  And that ammonium tends to acidify the soil as it is transformed.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  The soils in the temperate regions resist that acidification.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  They still need lime periodically, but the soils in the tropics will acidify very rapidly  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  and often are already acidified.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  So yes, it makes a big difference in the ability to hold nutrients and in the influence on  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  soil pH, soil reaction.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  Sometimes pH is called soil reaction.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  And those have a big influence on crop productivity.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  Can you talk a little bit about cation exchange capacity of clays and why that's important  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  from an agricultural perspective?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  Okay, so a growing plant, you know, we all know they need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:12):**  or potash.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  Sometimes potassium is called potash, right?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:16):**  Those are important macronutrients for a crop to grow in.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  But they also need other elements like calcium, magnesium, and metals like zinc in lesser  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:33):**  amounts.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  Okay, if my hand is a clay mineral, if it's one of these smectides, they have sites of  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  what we call isomorphous substitution.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  Basically, in the structure, we have an aluminum atom or we have a magnesium atom where an  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  aluminum atom ought to be.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  And that creates a negative charge which is manifested on the surface.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  So just think of a little minus sign right here on my hand, and that minus sign holds  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:17):**  a cation.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  It attracts it.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  If I'm down in the tropics and I have oxides, which don't tend to be platey, they're more  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  globular in nature, they don't have those negative charges.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  They're not able to retain a cation by electrostatic attraction, which means the cation is free  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  to leach when it rains.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:45):**  From a mineral standpoint, sand versus clay.  
**[0:09:49-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  Okay, well, sand, beach sand, is dominated by quartz, SiO2, silicon oxide.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  Quartz exists as roughly, not quite spherical, but about equidimensional particle.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  And quartz particles, those surfaces on the quartz particles, they can have a positive  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  charge, a negative charge, or a neutral charge.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  They have a positive charge when they're in a very acidic environment.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  You put them in acid.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  They have a neutral, they have a basic or a negative charge when they are in a very  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  alkaline environment.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:48):**  You put them in sodium hydroxide, right?  
**[0:10:52-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  But across most of the range, pH range, where crops are grown, where soils of agronomic  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  value, those quartz particles have a neutral surface.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  They do not have either a positive or a negative charge.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  So it varies as a function of pH.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:16):**  They have very low surface area, even a...  
**[0:11:22-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  And okay, so if you look at the mineralogy, it's dominantly quartz, there are other minerals  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  in there.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  There are minerals called feldspars and a number of other phases, but by and large,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  sand is hugely dominated by quartz.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  Okay.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  Clays are not quartz.  
**[0:11:50-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:50):**  They have some silicon in them, but they also have aluminum and iron and magnesium, and  
**[0:12:02-0:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:02):**  they have very different morphology, and they can have enormous surface area.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:11):**  So if I have a one gram of sand, so about the tip of my thumb there, of sand, that might  
**[0:12:22-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  have a surface area of, let's say, oh, a tenth or even a hundredth of a meter square per  
**[0:12:37-0:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  gram, so very small, if I had a one gram of a fully expanding smectite, a montmorillonite,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:51):**  so spectite's kind of a family name, montmorillonite is one of the members of that family.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  It can have a surface area of almost 800 meters squared per gram.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:06):**  So an enormous amount of surface area.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:10):**  And on those surfaces are those negative charges we talked about before.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  So your quartz particle is essentially tiny amount of surface area and neutral.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  Your clay particle has enormous amount of surface area and charged sites on those surfaces.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  Those charged sites hold not just one cation, but millions and billions of cations, and  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:41):**  the cations and the charged sites hold water.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  Okay, the quartz particle, you know, the water just runs right through it, doesn't stick.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  The clay particle, the water forms a nice film of water around it that encompasses those  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  cations and those charged surfaces.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:10):**  If we took the quartz particle and we round it down to make it equal size of a clay particle,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  so size was no different, would they both have similar surface area or would the clay  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  still have a lot more surface area and if so, why?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  Okay, so this really gets to a very complicated question of what is particle size.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:46):**  We operationally define it by a method that we use to measure particle size.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  We put some soil in a tube with water and we disperse it until it's a nice uniform homogeneous  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  and then we measure the density of it with a hydrometer.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  One of those things you measure the sugar content of a wine or the alcohol content of  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  a wine.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:20):**  And we measure that as a function of time and of course the sand particles settle out  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  first to the bottom of that tube and then the silk particles which are different size  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  between sand and clay settle out and that clay stays in suspension for a longer period  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:39):**  of time.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:41):**  And so we put a model together, a mathematical algorithm that assumes that those particles  
**[0:15:48-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:48):**  are perfect spheres with a certain density to it and how fast would they settle.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  The reality is that quartz behaves about like we would expect it to in our mathematical  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  model.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:08):**  By the way, that model is called Stokes' law.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  It defines how fast a particle of a certain size and density settles in water.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  But clays, because they are very thin and have very wide surfaces, they actually settle  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:30):**  more like a parachute.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:35):**  They don't, you know, you drop a rock and it goes down, you drop a parachute or a leaf  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  and it goes down very slowly.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:46):**  And this is because of the shape.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  So you say that they are less than two micron particle size.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  That's a clay, right?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  That's how we define it.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  But that means what we call equivalent spherical diameter.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  Reality is you can have smectites that are tens of microns across, bigger than your silk  
**[0:17:18-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  particles, but they will settle much more slowly because they behave like a parachute.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  So when we say particle size, it gets confusing as to what you really mean.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:36):**  Are you talking about equivalent spherical diameter or are you talking about the actual  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:41):**  physical dimension of the particle?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  And if you're talking about the physical dimension, are you talking about it in the X, Y plane  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  or in the Z plane?  
**[0:17:52-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  They can be extremely thin, like a sheet of paper, literally, you know, just imagine a  
**[0:18:01-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  sheet of paper floating in there, very, very thin, but big X, Y direction.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  So to get back and try and answer your question, if we could grind a quartz particle down,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  we can, it would increase the surface area, but nowhere near as much as you have with  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  these smectites.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  Furthermore, what would happen is the quartz would dissolve very quickly.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  If you look at the mineralogy of clays, you find quartz in the coarse clay fraction that  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  is in the greater than, or the size that is between 0.2 and 2 microns.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  You'll find quartz there, but you won't find quartz in the less than 0.2 micron fraction.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  Okay, however, these smectites, because they behave like a parachute, so if you use equivalent  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  spherical diameter, they are all less than this 0.2 microns.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  They can be tens of microns across, but they behave like they are a parachute moving down  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:31):**  through that water.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  They don't settle very fast at all, but there's a very different mineralogy down there.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  They do not, they are stable, whereas quartz, if it were that fine, would be unstable, would  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  rapidly dissolve, disappear.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:53):**  I don't know if I fully answered your question.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:55):**  You did, and it's really fascinating, and I'm glad you went to that extent to answer it.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  So a clay particle is essentially a clay particle forever, and I know a geological time scale  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:14):**  is a very long period of time.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  They evolve, but they never, and I'll say never, but I don't mean never, like it takes  
**[0:20:22-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:22):**  a very, very long time for that clay to dissolve like the quartz would dissolve, relative.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  It just depends on the soil environment.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  So these smectites are stable in a temperate region soil.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  If I took that smectite down to Brazil and put it in a oxisole, a really old soil down  
**[0:20:55-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  in the Amazon jungle of Brazil, that smectite would decompose, degrade very rapidly.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  Maybe not overnight, you understand, but in a year or two it would disappear, but it would  
**[0:21:15-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:15):**  persist and it might even grow in a soil here in Iowa.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  So the environment makes a difference, and what is the big difference?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  A lot of it is the pH, how acid or basic that soil is.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:37):**  The soils down in the Amazon tend to be quite acidic.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  They also are leached of what we call base cations, cations like calcium, magnesium,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  potassium.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:51):**  Those get leached out of those soils down there, whereas they are enriched in our soils  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  in the Midwest.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  And the presence of those cations has an influence on the stability of the clay and how fast  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:09):**  that clay can be decomposed or changed.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  I don't know if you know this or not.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  I'll take a shot at this question.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  Is there anything related to clays that made it possible for the Great Plains to evolve  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  to be what they were?  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:33):**  First of all, you also need to understand that depending on where you are in the Great  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:39):**  Plains, there's a big difference in time.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  So I need to back up one step.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  In classic literature, there are five soil-forming factors.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  The parent material, what type of rock, is one of those.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:10):**  The climate, is it hot and dry?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:15):**  Is it wet and hot?  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  Is it cold?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:19):**  Has a big influence on soil formation.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  Biology, and by biology I mean obviously plant communities, but also the microorganisms,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  and you can even throw human beings into that biology piece as well.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:43):**  Topography is another soil-forming factor.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  So if you are up on top of a hillside or if you're down in a valley, it makes a big difference.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  Material moves, is eroded off the hilltop and settles out down in the valley bottom,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  but also water moves through the soil laterally downhill towards that valley, and it leaches  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  nutrients cations from up high and carries them down, salts, and so on.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  The fifth soil-forming factor is time.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  So when you go into the Great Plains, and I'm located in Ames, Iowa, 14,000 years ago  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:42):**  where I'm sitting right now, there was, I don't know, somewhere like half a mile of  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  ice above my head.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  I'd be at the bottom of a massive glacier.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  Well when that glacier came marching down out of Canada, it was like a giant bulldozer.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  It ripped all the soils from the Canadians and from northern Minnesota and brought it  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:13):**  down here and dumped it here in central Iowa.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  It ground, took giant boulders and ground it up into flour.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:24):**  Okay.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  On the other hand, if I go down to, let's say, central Kansas, okay, okay, sorry.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  So my point was that the soils here in Iowa are actually very young.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  They're babies as far as soils go.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  But I go down to central Kansas, and they're very old, hundreds of thousands of years,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  maybe, I don't know, depends on where you are.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  If you know, sometimes you've got areas that are eroding and depositing, and those would  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  be younger.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  But if you have a stable surface, that soil could have been there for a very long period  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  of time.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  And we talked earlier about how clay minerals evolve with time.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  So imagine that I, after the glacier came down, right, I've got, I ground up a rock,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  that rock had in it mica, feldspars, quartz, and other primary minerals that got ground  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  up into flour.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  And then the glacier melts away, and we're left with this pulverized rock.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  Well, then these soil forming factors start impacting that pulverized rock, the, you know,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:05):**  the climate, the biology, the topography.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  What am I missing, time, and I forget, but I dropped one here.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  Those factors start influencing the evolution.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:22):**  And so you have chemistry going on, you have biology going on, you have physics going on  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  in that soil environment.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  And particles of primary minerals tend to be unstable.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  They tend to dissolve.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:47):**  On the other hand, clay minerals actually start to be nucleated and start to grow right  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:54):**  there in the soil.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:58):**  And some clay minerals are, like if you have a mica, a muscovite, right, you've all seen  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  the big sheets of muscovite.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  Well, if I, that's very similar to these clay minerals, but I can, I can sort of change  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  that a little bit.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  And there's iron in that muscovite, not a lot, but there's a little bit.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:31):**  And I can oxidize that iron, turn it from a two plus to a three plus phase.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  And when I do that, it changes the amount of charge on that surfaces.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  The mica will start to open up, the individual layers will open up, it'll get physically  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  broken into smaller and smaller particles.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  The potassium, which is sitting between each of those layers, it's leached out.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  Plants take it up.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:06):**  And so there's what's called a solid state transformation where I can take that mica  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  and turn it into smectites.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:15):**  There's also neogenesis, which is another process in which smectites formed by precipitation  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  reactions, they start literally chemically building on top of each other and grow right  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  there in the soil.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  So we have some of both of those going on in the soil environment.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  And so the 14,000 years that, since the glaciers left right here in Iowa, in central Iowa,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  have been enough that we've made some smectites, not a huge amount in many cases, but some.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  But if I go down to eastern south central Kansas now, we've had a long, long period  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  of stable, on a stable surface, not an eroding or depositional area, but on a stable surface,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:14):**  and a long time for weather to influence and biology to influence those soils.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  And the smectite, the easily weathered minerals, you know, pretty well weathered away.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  You've formed lots of these smectites.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  Go further south, down into Georgia, and the smectites start transforming into another  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  mineral called kaolinite.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:49):**  You're probably familiar with kaolinite because it's often used in making pottery.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  Okay?  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:56):**  But the smectites have very unique properties.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  They can shrink and swell, they can imbibe water between each of the layers.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:09):**  The kaolinite doesn't do that.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:13):**  It's when, and the transformation that occurs is the loss of silicon.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  So all right, now this is going to get really deep in the weeds, but in a smectite, we have  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:30):**  what's called a two to one layer.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  So you've got a silica tetrahedral layer, an aluminum octahedral layer, and another  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  silica tetrahedral layer.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  Three layers, basically that's four oxygen atoms thick.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  All right?  
**[0:31:52-0:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:52):**  What happens in a kaolinite is one of those silica tetrahedral layers disappears.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:00):**  And I have a silica tetrahedral layer and an aluminum octahedral layer left.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  So I have leached silicon out.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:12):**  I go further south, down into the Amazon now, and the kaolinite starts to do, there's still  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  a lot of kaolinite in the Amazon, but it starts to disappear.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  And I'm left with just iron and aluminum oxygen.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  So in other words, this time factor that influences soil formation and clay evolution involves  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  the leaching of what we'll call base cations, calcium, magnesium, potassium, they tend to  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  get leached out first, and then silicon gets leached out.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  And finally, we're left with nothing but this iron and aluminum oxides.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  Minerals like girthite, lipidicrocyte, gibbsite, these are the minerals that are, the clay  
**[0:33:07-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  minerals that are left behind after this process of evolution.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  So if I put, say a common plant, corn, corn in smectites, corn in girthite, is the plant  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  going to know the difference between the two or perform differently given what's leached  
**[0:33:34-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:34):**  out of that clay when you go from smectite to the Amazonian clay?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  The corn plant growing in Amazonian soils is going to be deficient in calcium, magnesium,  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  potassium, a lot of these cations that are really important for crop growth, unless I'm  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  putting those on.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:02):**  I can put lime on and I can put potash on, and I can make those oxisols productive.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  I usually don't have to do that if I've got a smectite rich soil.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:23):**  Let me pause you there.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:24):**  Is that because the smectite is holding it or are the minerals within the clay biologically  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:33):**  available?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:34):**  So some microorganisms in the soil can put out acids or enzymes that dissolve that clay  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  and break it down.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  Can they go do that from clay particles?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:46):**  Yes, because if you have a, okay, so this is complicated, but if you have a primary  
**[0:34:54-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:54):**  mineral like a feldspar, okay, this has some potassium in it and it is slowly being dissolved  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  away and slowly releasing potassium and plants are taking it up.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:07):**  If you have a mica, a muscovite, it is slowly being weathered, the layers are opening up  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:14):**  and releasing potassium.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  Once they get in the solution, plants or microbes can use that potassium.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  The same with calcium.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  Calcium isn't found inside of micas, but it certainly can be found inside of feldspar.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  Okay, magnesium.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  So you can weather those and release those base cations and as long as there's a balance  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  in equilibrium, as long as there are primary minerals to be weathered, you're going to  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  have a certain population in the soil solution which will be there for the plants.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  You go down to these oxisols down in the tropics and that's gone.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  There's no reservoir of those cationic nutrients left.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  You have to throw it all on top in terms of lime and fertilizer.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  In fact, in the tropics, most of the nutrients are actually in the organic layer, the litter,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  the leaves, and the biology.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  This is kind of an interesting phenomenon.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  I diverged slightly, but we have these incredibly weathered soils out of the tropics and yet  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  they support the greatest biome on the planet, the rainforest.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  Sounds like a contradiction, but there's a reason for that and that's the biology.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  A leaf falls to the ground in the rainforest.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  It hits the ground and there's potassium and calcium, magnesium in that leaf.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  But as soon as it hits the surface of the soil, there are organisms of fungi, bacteria,  
**[0:37:16-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:16):**  tylomycetes that eat up that leaf and recycle those nutrients back into the rainforest.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  So it's a closed system.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  Those nutrients are continuously recycled.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:34):**  But if I come in and slat and burn, you know, cut away the rainforest, then I disrupt that  
**[0:37:43-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  biological web and what nutrients are there quickly get leached out.  
**[0:37:52-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  And then the rainforest, the tropical forest, soils cease to be productive.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  Whereas the soils here in Iowa are intrinsically rich in these nutrients and can produce them  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:11):**  through the slow weathering of these primary minerals.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  Now the smectites, as I said, they tend to be stable in this way.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  So they're maybe not going to weather as rapidly.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  You know, unless I start taking them down to, you know, like Georgia or Alabama or someplace,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:33):**  then they're going to start weathering and disappearing and they will release some nutrients  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  as the weather.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  Being very simple is one of the huge benefits to an ecosystem for these smectites, these  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:52):**  clays, is they provide a stable source of nutrients that's accessible, but it's there  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:00):**  over a very, very long period of time.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  I think the key thing about the smectites is the cation exchange, those negative charges  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  that we talked about earlier, because they will hold cations and prevent them from leaching.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:22):**  But the smectites themselves, are they, you know, they have minerals making them up.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  Elements.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:30):**  Elements.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:31):**  Is the biology going in there and saying, okay, I'm going to take this smectite and  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:36):**  the smectite itself is, it's ABC components and suddenly now they're free floating.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:42):**  A is by itself, B is by itself, C is by itself because they've broken those bonds and the  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:47):**  smectite is no longer a molecule.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:53):**  That process can happen.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:56):**  Again, if you can start moving towards warmer, wetter environments, like down in Georgia,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:04):**  the smectites will slowly disintegrate and they'll go from this three layer system to  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  the two layer system.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:14):**  And during that process, there will be the release of any of the exchangeable cations,  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:22):**  which could be calcium, magnesium, potassium, for example, that are held between the layers.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  That will be released to the soil solution.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  This will take it up.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  Eventually if we start weathering it, they'll be leached out.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  Within the two to one layers, there is some magnesium, which is an important nutrient,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:48):**  but there isn't a lot of other nutrients.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  It's mostly silicon and aluminum, magnesium and some iron are the dominant elements inside  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  the structure.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  The exchangeable cations or the interlayer cations, those are the real reservoir of nutrients  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  for the plants.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:10):**  So think of, you know, I'm looking for a book here, right?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  A manuscript, I've got a book, right?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  I've got a bunch of pages in this book and all of the letters on those pages are like  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:32):**  those negative chart sites.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:35):**  And each one of those is holding a nutrient that, you know, could be a potassium or calcium,  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:45):**  right?  
**[0:41:47-0:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:47):**  But the pages of this book, you know, can be separated.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:54):**  I could take it.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  Now I've got two pieces, right?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  All right.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  So the answer is yes, but it's not the minerals that are inside the two to one layers.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  It's the minerals that are between the two to one layers that the smectite provides.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  Those cation exchange points, you have minerals held there by charge.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:27):**  There's a bond there.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  What in biology produces something strong enough to break that bond to release it?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:40):**  Plant needs it.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:41):**  How does it get off that point?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:43):**  How do you dissolve that bond?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:48):**  So if we're talking about a smectite surface where we've got a negative surface charge  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:53):**  site on that surface, and I've got a positively charged cation, the interaction that holds  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  that cation to the surface, the chemical bond is primarily what we call an ionic bond.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  It's just a positive negative charge thing, where the negative charge attracts the positive  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:14):**  charge.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  The only way you get that cation off is if another cation comes along and knocks it off,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  trades places with it.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:27):**  Okay?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  That other cation can be a proton, an acid, right?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  So a hydrogen atom, which has a plus one charge to it.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  So I could have a potassium cation held on this clay surface, and a proton, a hydrogen  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  atom, hydrogen ion comes in and knocks it off and takes its place.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  I'm left with the hydrogen on this smectite surface.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  The potassium is now in solution, and the plant can take it out.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  Plants will release acids from their roots with the very deliberate intent of extracting  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  the nutrient cations off the clay surfaces.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  Is that hydrogen bond in the acid more attractive to that negative charge point than the cations  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:31):**  positive change?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:32):**  In other words, I guess what I'm getting at, how does it, positive charge is going after  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  one negative.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:38):**  How does one knock another one off?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:40):**  If they're both equal strength, why doesn't the cation just hang on?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:47):**  Okay, so this is the heart of cation exchange.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  Well actually it gets really deep here, but first of all, there are billions and billions  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  of cations swarming around continuously.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:10):**  Some of them are held very tightly to the surface, right next to the surface, directly  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:19):**  touching the clay surface.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:22):**  But some of those cations, think of this eraser as a cation, are actually surrounded by water.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  And the water, there's a layer of water between that cation and the surface.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:36):**  And now I've got a proton out here or another cation, which is also surrounded by water.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:45):**  And that can come in and just sort of by like bowling ball or like billiard balls, right?  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  You shoot a pool, right?  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:55):**  You shoot a ball across the table, it hits another one, bing, and it flies off.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  So just by kinetic motion, movement, you can, you know, like a billiard ball, knock, hit  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  one ball, knock the other one off, that one stays behind.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  And that's going on billions of times a second in a gram of soil.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  And it's a matter of statistics.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:27):**  If I start putting in acid in there, hydrogen atoms that have a positive charge, eventually  
**[0:46:40-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  I'm going to be reaching out the exchangeable base cations like potassium, calcium, and  
**[0:46:48-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  magnesium.  
**[0:46:52-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  And the plant's able to then, is this another ratio thing where there's so many that have  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  been knocked off that the plant can soak them up before the ones that get soaked up reattach?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:08):**  Yeah, well, it's statistics, you know, you have to realize that plant roots, if you have  
**[0:47:17-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17):**  a, and this really gets at the heart of a lot of things.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  If I have a prairie or a sod, grass, right, I've got solid surface cover, but I've also  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  got millions of roots that are through the soil.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  But not only do I have all those roots and root hairs, which are sub microscopic, but  
**[0:47:48-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  I also have a fungi, mycorrhizae, that is living symbiotically in those roots.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  And the fungi have what are called hyphae, little tiny threads.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  And literally in that sod, or in a native prairie, I have a root, a root hair, or a  
**[0:48:17-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  fungal hyphae that is traversing every cubic millimeter of soil volume.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:25):**  It's everywhere.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  And they work together to take up nutrient ions.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:37):**  The fungi might take it up and give the nutrient to the plant, and the plant would give some  
**[0:48:44-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:44):**  sugar, basically, some food, nutrient, to the fungi, to the mycorrhizae.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  That symbiosis that's going on.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  Now if I go into a row crop field, okay, well, all right, now think about it for a moment.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:07):**  I plant the crop in the spring onto what is essentially bare soil.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  Well, I put the seed there.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  If there are no plants growing there, there are no roots, and if there are no roots, there  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  are no mycorrhizae fungi.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  The biology doesn't exist, that incredible network of roots, mycorrhizae fungi, hyphae,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  is not there to recycle nutrients.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:36):**  So in cultivated soils, much of the year, you know, only for, you know, four months,  
**[0:49:43-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  something like that, I've got a crop there.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  The rest of the year, I have nothing.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:49):**  Well, the soils are vulnerable to leaching, because I don't have that root hyphae network  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  there to recycle the nutrients.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:03):**  All right, so when it rains, any excess cations can be kind of leached out.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  So again, you know, we're really getting into the weeds here of chemistry, but...  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:26):**  It's good though.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  I think it answers a lot of questions.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  This is cool stuff.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:30):**  I'm into it, I'm into it, so let's stay in the weeds.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:34):**  Well, I have a question.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  So that's the point of that soil evolution, and this is one of the reasons why row crop  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:46):**  soils tend to acidify.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:49):**  They acidify because we put nitrogen on there, ammonium nitrogen, which releases protons  
**[0:50:56-0:51:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  or hydrogen ions that make it acid, but also we tend to leach the base cations out of these  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:09):**  row crop soils, and they get acidified, so we have to come in and periodically lime them,  
**[0:51:15-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:15):**  instead ag-lime, which is basically calcium carbonate, or calcium and magnesium carbonate,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  to replenish it.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:30):**  All right.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  We have evolution of soils and clays over a long period of time.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  Geologic timescale we've been talking.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  Now if we kind of go on a much shorter timescale, human scale, I think a lot of people have  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:44):**  noticed this in a row crop field in a garden, they start wanting to plant something, they  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  start digging and they're pulling up chunks of clay.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:55):**  Maybe they're basketball size, really large, feels like clay, looks like clay, chunks.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  When you start to put plants in that, people say, well, the clay goes away, but it's not

**[0:52:26-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  When you have a lot of clay, you introduce plants to it, what happens to that clay?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  Is it breaking apart?  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  Is it diluting down?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:37):**  Is it just fracturing?  
**[0:52:39-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  Is it going away?  
**[0:52:41-0:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  But on the timescale of the human lifetime, soils can evolve, but not very much unless  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:57):**  there's erosion or deposition.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:01):**  You can lose massive amount of soil in a single store in one night if you've got horrible

**[0:53:08-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:08):**  If you're not having erosion, then the changes are relatively slow.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  You can observe some of those changes in a few decades.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  For example, if one of the things we saw in soils that were being acidified by large amounts  
**[0:53:37-0:53:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  of nitrogen fertilizer was that we were chemically altering the soil and you were losing cation  
**[0:53:47-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:47):**  exchange capacity.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:55):**  The clay minerals were evolving so that you have freely swelling spectites with all these  
**[0:54:01-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  negative charges on the surface, but the interlayers were starting to get gummed up with hydroxides  
**[0:54:10-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  with aluminum iron, which inhibited the swelling and blocked the cation exchange sites.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  So that can happen on the scale of a few decades.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:28):**  You can see a change, but for the most part, it doesn't change very rapidly.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  The mineralogy doesn't change.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:37):**  Organic matter is different.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  Soil organic matter is a very reactive and very important component of our soil fertility,  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  productivity and its physical properties.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  What is soil organic matter?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:57):**  It's dead plant tissue microbes, but they have evolved.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  They are no longer, you know, certainly I put a leaf down there, you can recognize the  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  leaf and you can watch the leaf decompose.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  Now you're releasing various organic molecules.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  Those molecules can be a group of amino acids, a peptide, right, or it can be sugars, two  
**[0:55:35-0:55:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:35):**  or three sugar molecules linked together, saccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide,  
**[0:55:42-0:55:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:42):**  or something like that.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:45):**  And you can have various chemical reactions that cause those to polymerize.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:54):**  Or you can add in a silicon or aluminum that would tend to coagulate those organic molecules.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  And you are producing over time, what we call humus for humic substances that are present  
**[0:56:13-0:56:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:13):**  in the soil, that give soils the black color.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:21):**  This humic material exists in a number of different forms.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  Think of it kind of as a fuzzy furry film that sort of coats the mineral surfaces, fills  
**[0:56:37-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  voids between mineral particles, can fluff up the soil.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  Okay, you start taking your clay minerals and you cover it with humic materials, and  
**[0:56:55-0:56:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  they're going to be less likely to swell.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:58):**  You can even get some humic materials inside of the clays themselves, inhibiting the swelling.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  Humic materials also contain lots of other nutrients.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:12):**  So we've been talking mostly about cations like potassium, calcium, magnesium.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:21):**  For a plant to grow also needs nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:30):**  And these tend to exist as anions, negatively charged ions.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  The nitrogen can exist both as a positive and negative, can exist as a ammonium, which  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:44):**  is plus one, or it can exist as nitrate, which is the minus one.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  And it can be transformed between the two.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:54):**  Okay, it can also exist as an amino acid inside of that humic material.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:03):**  So typically, soil humus has a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 10 to 1.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:12):**  And as microbes consume the humus, the nitrogen, which is part of the amino acids that is part  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:22):**  of this humic material, gets released into the soil solution as an ammonium form.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  And plants can take that out.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:32):**  So the humus plays a very critical role in supplying particularly nitrogen, but also  
**[0:58:41-0:58:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:41):**  to some extent phosphorus and sulfur and other more anionic nutrients to support plant productivity.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:52):**  So really they work synergistically together.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  But what you're referring to is, you know, you talked about these chunks of clay.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:00):**  Well, of course, they're not pure clay, they're a mixture of clay, sand and silt.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:06):**  But if you get enough clay in there, they can dry out and become quite hard.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:12):**  You get enough humus in there, and you can basically sort of fluff it up.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  The humus has a low density.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:23):**  And it fills all these pores in between the particles and fluffs it up.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:28):**  It holds water, it provides habitat for microorganisms, and it provides food for microorganisms.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  So the humus, the soil or organic matter, evolves relatively rapidly.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:47):**  Whereas I mentioned ago that the, you know, the mineralogy doesn't change much on a human  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  lifetime timescale, a little bit, but not a lot, unless there's an erosion event, that  
**[1:00:01-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:01):**  sort of thing.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  But the organic matter can go up and down, up and down, depending on how you manage that  
**[1:00:10-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  soil.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  If I'm putting lots of manure on, I'm keeping, you know, I have a perennial crop, a grass  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:23):**  crop, as opposed to a row crop, which is there just firmly here.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:30):**  I'm putting greater amounts of organic matter, fresh biological material, plant roots, leaves,  
**[1:00:37-1:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  stems into the soil.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:40):**  I build up the organic matter.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:43):**  But if I, you know, let's say I grew silage corn, right, and I was cutting that silage  
**[1:00:52-1:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:52):**  off, taking it away, and not putting anything back on that soil, I would cause rapid degradation  
**[1:01:02-1:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:02):**  of soil quality, and much of that would be due to the loss of the organic matter.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:11):**  Also it would be due to removal of the potassium, calcium that are in the silage corn.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:18):**  Okay, so you can, in a lifetime, you can take a very fertile soil and make it very infertile,  
**[1:01:28-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  or you could take an infertile soil and build it back up, depending on how you manage what  
**[1:01:34-1:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  you put back in.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:35):**  We have a sandy soil dominated by sand particles.  
**[1:01:46-1:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:46):**  Can you add clay to that soil and turn that into more of a productive loam?  
**[1:02:01-1:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:01):**  And kind of part two of that is, or if you took a sandy soil and added organic matter  
**[1:02:06-1:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:06):**  to it, probably the more likely option for most people in that situation, what would  
**[1:02:14-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:14):**  be different?  
**[1:02:15-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  Would you take sand, you add clay and organic matter, or you take sand and that organic  
**[1:02:19-1:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:19):**  matter, are you going to end up with dramatically different salts?  
**[1:02:27-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:27):**  So if I had a very sandy soil that has low clay, low silk content, just sand mostly,  
**[1:02:35-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  right, and I put manure on it, let's say, it can be productive, and the manure will  
**[1:02:45-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  help, but for a short period of time, that manure will rapidly decompose, it will be  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  oxidized and be turned into carbon dioxide and other nutrient elements that are in the  
**[1:03:01-1:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:01):**  manure will either be taken up by a plant or leached out and very quickly, that sandy  
**[1:03:08-1:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:08):**  soil, you know, I get a flush of productivity from the manure, but then very quickly, it's  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:16):**  lost and I'm right back where I was starting from.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:20):**  Okay, clay works synergistically with organic matter.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  The clay minerals help to stabilize humus, soil humus, slow down its rate of decomposition  
**[1:03:39-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:39):**  and help to hold not only nutrients, but water in the soil.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  So conceptually, and this is done in some parts of the world, I could put clay into  
**[1:03:54-1:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:54):**  a sandy soil and mix it up and throw in some manure and other organic residues, and I could  
**[1:04:02-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:02):**  turn a really lousy sandy soil into a nice productivity, a nice high productivity soil.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  I could make a brand new soil, a high quality soil out of a sandy mess.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:22):**  One of the key problems with sandy soils is they have low water holding capacity.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:31):**  If it rains, most of the water just percolates through the sand and goes on down into the  
**[1:04:36-1:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  subsoil.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:38):**  So if it doesn't, you know, I could plant a seed in there, and if it rains every other  
**[1:04:44-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:44):**  day, you know, I'm going to grow my crop.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  But if you get a three week period with no rain, that plant runs out of water and dies  
**[1:04:55-1:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  for lack of water.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:58):**  In a clay or a nice loamy soil where I've got a mixture of sand, silt, clay, organic  
**[1:05:04-1:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:04):**  matter, has a much higher water holding capacity.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:11):**  It's able to, the plant is then able to live on reservoirs of water that are retained in  
**[1:05:20-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:20):**  that soil and get through that three week drought until the next rain comes and then  
**[1:05:27-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  keep growing.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  So the resilience is what that combination of clay and organic matter add to that soil,  
**[1:05:38-1:05:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  which is why it's so much better.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:41):**  You can grow, you know, great crops in sandy soils if you've got a fertigation system,  
**[1:05:53-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:53):**  so you're irrigating it and putting in nutrients, and you're spoon feeding those in, you know,  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:00):**  you can do it.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:05):**  But you've got to have a very high level of management to do that.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:10):**  You've got to spoon feed both the water and the nutrients to the crop in a sandy soil.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:18):**  Whereas in a loamy soil, you've got a much more robust and resilient system.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:27):**  And it requires, quite frankly, less management to get a good crop out of it.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:35):**  A lot of times you hear people talk about clay soils in a very negative way because  
**[1:06:40-1:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:40):**  of the work that may be associated with it.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:42):**  You know, it's hard to dig through, etc.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:47):**  It sounds like you're in this.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  I mean, you'd rather have that scenario because you can add organic matter pretty easily.  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:55):**  You can put that in and that's going to do a lot more for you than have a soil where,  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  you know, you snap your fingers and that percentage of clay is a lot lower, and yeah, you know,  
**[1:07:05-1:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:05):**  the soil is like nice and easy to work, but you're giving up on all the benefit of having  
**[1:07:11-1:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:11):**  that clay in there.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:12):**  Well, I wouldn't go that far.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  There's such a thing as too much clay.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:19):**  And I think a lot of farmers will tell you that.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:24):**  If you get too much clay, well, it can be tough.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:32):**  You know, it can get sticky, it holds so much water, you can't get, you try and drive through  
**[1:07:39-1:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  it and you get stuck.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:43):**  The soil can become impermeable.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:47):**  So you have rain landing on the soil surface.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:52):**  You don't want that rainwater to run off.  
**[1:07:56-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:56):**  You want that rainwater to soak in.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  You get too much clay in the soil and it doesn't soak in, it runs off the surface.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:09):**  You can have, and if you're in, let's say, a depressional area and you've got a lot of  
**[1:08:19-1:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  clay in there, well then water is moving in and it tends to be saturated.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:28):**  And plant roots need air.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:31):**  They need water, but they also need to be able to breathe.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:37):**  And you'll, if it's saturated for too long a period of time, it'll kill your crop.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  Unless it's rice, right?  
**[1:08:48-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  So some crops are engineered to survive, right?  
**[1:08:52-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  But most corn or wheat will drown if they don't have proper drainage through that soil.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  So what you're looking for is that balance, you know, everything in moderation, right?  
**[1:09:11-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:11):**  You want a good amount of sand, you want silt, you want clay, you want organic matter in  
**[1:09:16-1:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  the right mix, and you want porosity.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:21):**  You want holes, bubbles, air in there.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:25):**  And you want biology so everything is turning over rapidly, releasing nutrients from the  
**[1:09:33-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:33):**  organic matter and new organic matter being added.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  That's what makes the most productive soils.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  So if you had heavy clay soil, in a do-anything world, would it make sense to add sand to  
**[1:09:53-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  that clay soil to increase the size and break that clay up, dilute it out?  
**[1:10:01-1:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  You certainly could do that.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:06):**  If it's in your backyard, right, your garden, and you're willing to pay $10 for a tomato,  
**[1:10:14-1:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  absolutely, right?  
**[1:10:15-1:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:15):**  If you're a farmer who's trying to earn a living by growing crops, it's generally not  
**[1:10:21-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:21):**  going to be economically viable to do something like that.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:27):**  The cost of moving sand into a clay soil or vice versa, clay into a sandy soil, yes, it  
**[1:10:40-1:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40):**  can be done and yes, it can be effective, but often it is not going to be cost effective  
**[1:10:47-1:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:47):**  and be too expensive and you'll never recoup your investment from a strictly business perspective.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:56):**  Knowing that this evolution of clay does occur over very long periods of time, and I agree  
**[1:11:02-1:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  with you, adding sand to everything is not practical, but seed is relatively cheap.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:08):**  Could you make a difference in a farmer's lifetime, and not even a farmer's lifetime,  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  but in a farmer's career, economic lifetime, by putting plants into the ground?  
**[1:11:20-1:11:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  Can roots break up a heavy clay fast enough to change people to actually make a difference,  
**[1:11:27-1:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:27):**  or is that just sounds good in theory, but not in reality?  
**[1:11:32-1:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  No, no, no.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:35):**  That is actually fairly widely practiced agronomic agronomy through crop rotations.  
**[1:11:54-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  If you grow continuous corn and your soil is starting to degrade, you could put it into  
**[1:12:04-1:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  a four-inch lagoon.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:05):**  Alfalfa, for example, for a couple of years, and alfalfa has these magnificent roots that  
**[1:12:13-1:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:13):**  tend to break up soil, that tend to put in organic matter and human, and build up the  
**[1:12:18-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  organic matter and add nutrients to the soil.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  So a crop rotation that includes a four-inch lagoon is precisely what you're talking about,  
**[1:12:31-1:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:31):**  hoping to build up the organic matter and the nutrient value of that soil.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:37):**  And this is what we did before we had synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:42):**  We used rotations.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:45):**  Some farmers still do, many farmers still do.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  It all sort of boils it down again to economics.  
**[1:12:55-1:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  Do you have a market for that hay crop, right?  
**[1:13:05-1:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:05):**  But yes, absolutely.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:08):**  That's what management is all about.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:10):**  That's what crop rotations are all about.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:14):**  Looking through some of the earlier work that you did, going back 15, 20 years, that was  
**[1:13:19-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  looking at a lot of clays and organic matter relationship.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  When you have organic matter in the soil and next to clay, are they only interacting at  
**[1:13:30-1:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:30):**  those cation exchange points, or is there something else happening?  
**[1:13:33-1:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:33):**  Is that clay providing some sort of additional benefit to that organic matter?  
**[1:13:42-1:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:42):**  Clays and organic matter definitely interact.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:49):**  I did a lot of electron microscopy trying to understand how all this, you know, how  
**[1:13:58-1:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  the microstructure of where the organic matter is, where the clay particles are, where the  
**[1:14:05-1:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  sand particles are, how they interact.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:13):**  The clay can, for example, protect the organic matter from being decomposed.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:22):**  So I mentioned earlier about putting manure on a sand, right, and how rapidly manure is  
**[1:14:29-1:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  completely, the word we use is mineralized, turned into carbon dioxide and to nutrients  
**[1:14:38-1:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:38):**  and the nutrients are leached away and the effect of the manure is gone and there's virtually  
**[1:14:45-1:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:45):**  nothing left to tell you never put it there.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:48):**  In that loamy soil or soil that has higher clay in it, manure carbon gets more, you know,  
**[1:14:58-1:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:58):**  be more effectively integrated into the humic materials and will persist for a longer period  
**[1:15:05-1:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:05):**  of time.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:07):**  Clay is slowing down the rate at which it is decomposed.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:13):**  We don't know all the reasons why this occurs.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:17):**  Some of it is related to water and aeration.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  Some of it may be physical, like clay acting like a shield to keep the microbe from getting  
**[1:15:28-1:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:28):**  to the humic substance.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:33):**  Some of it may also be different elements like aluminum and silicon that are being bound  
**[1:15:42-1:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:42):**  up inside the humic material and making it more difficult for microbes to eat it.  
**[1:15:53-1:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:53):**  Think about it for a moment.  
**[1:15:54-1:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:54):**  If you had a nice bowl of oatmeal, right, you know, and you're eating it, right, you  
**[1:16:01-1:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:01):**  know, that'd be pretty good, right?  
**[1:16:04-1:16:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:04):**  But if I put sand in that oatmeal and you try to eat it, it'd be a tough chew.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:08):**  All right, well now think about it.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:11):**  I've got humic materials and if I put a bunch of silicon and aluminum and iron in there,  
**[1:16:17-1:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:17):**  it's going to be more difficult for microbes to eat it.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:23):**  Okay, so there's a lot of things going on, processes, physical, chemical processes that  
**[1:16:32-1:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:32):**  influence the biology that's going on in the soil.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:38):**  And those interactions are what build soil quality.  
**[1:16:46-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:46):**  Is that changing dynamically?  
**[1:16:47-1:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  Meaning if we look at that soil in our microscope today, and then we came back two years later  
**[1:16:53-1:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:53):**  might we see maybe the clay around the organic matter now, but two years from now we might  
**[1:17:01-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01):**  not be able to find that.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  You know, could that change over time based upon whatever's happening environmentally?  
**[1:17:15-1:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:15):**  It is certainly dynamic.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:17):**  If you go out to a natural soil, I don't care, the sod in your yard, I don't know, wherever  
**[1:17:23-1:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:23):**  you want to go, right?  
**[1:17:27-1:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:27):**  You are constantly mineralizing the soil organic matter.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:33):**  Okay, so that means you're making, it's being consumed by microbes, and they're turning  
**[1:17:39-1:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:39):**  it into carbon dioxide, which is going off to the atmosphere.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:43):**  They're releasing the nitrogen that's part of the amino groups, for example, that are  
**[1:17:49-1:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:49):**  peptides that are bound up in the humic material.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:52):**  That nitrogen is going through various cycles and being taken up by plants or being used  
**[1:17:59-1:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:59):**  to build new microbe soil, soil microbodies, right?  
**[1:18:04-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:04):**  You know, new organisms, right?  
**[1:18:06-1:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:06):**  It's constantly being recycled.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:13):**  But there's also a living biomass there, the grass, the sod, and you've got roots that  
**[1:18:22-1:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:22):**  are growing and you've got leaves that are being added to that constantly.  
**[1:18:27-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:27):**  So you've got, you're losing some, but you're adding some at the same time.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  Now conceptually, you approach what we might call, it's not true equilibrium, it would  
**[1:18:40-1:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  be more like a steady state, is the terminology we use where the amount coming in and the  
**[1:18:47-1:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47):**  amount going out are roughly in balance.  
**[1:18:50-1:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:50):**  If, however, I left the soil fallow, I made sure there were no plants growing on it for  
**[1:19:01-1:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:01):**  10 years.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:05):**  I might start out with a soil organic matter of, I don't know, let's say 3%, okay?  
**[1:19:13-1:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:13):**  3% by mass in my surface horizon is organic matter.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:17):**  I feel pretty good about a soil like that.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:20):**  Ten years later, and I'm just making up this number, but it might be down to one and a  
**[1:19:27-1:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:27):**  half percent.  
**[1:19:28-1:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:28):**  You've lost a lot unless you've got something being added in.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:33):**  You kept it fallow for that 10 years, you could lose a lot.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:41):**  Because all that would be happening is the microbes would be chewing up the humic materials,  
**[1:19:47-1:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:47):**  you'd be emitting the CO2, but if you're not adding something back in, you're not maintaining  
**[1:19:54-1:19:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:54):**  the system.  
**[1:19:55-1:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:55):**  You are degrading it, you're mining it.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:59):**  This has been one of the big problems with row crop agriculture is that we do add crop  
**[1:20:05-1:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:05):**  residues and roots, but we don't add enough often to maintain the soil quality.  
**[1:20:14-1:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:14):**  Here in central Iowa, back 200 years ago, this was prairie, right?  
**[1:20:23-1:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:23):**  We had this massive prairie ecosystem with these massive root systems and sure the buffalo  
**[1:20:32-1:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:32):**  came through every now and then, prairie fires came through every now and then, but year  
**[1:20:39-1:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:39):**  after year we were putting carbon into the soil and of course carbon was being mineralized  
**[1:20:45-1:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:45):**  and leaving the soil as CO2, but you had oftentimes 6-8% organic carbon in that soil.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:55):**  Beautiful rich, black, loamy soils.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:01):**  Well then we came in and we plowed up the prairie and we grew a crop that added only  
**[1:21:10-1:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:10):**  a small amount of residue every year and we've lost at least half, maybe two-thirds of the  
**[1:21:19-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:19):**  organic matter that was in these prairie soils in the last 200 years of cultivation.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  Even though we've been plowing down the crop residues, we've been still losing ground,  
**[1:21:39-1:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:39):**  we've been losing organic matter and with that loss we lose intrinsic fertility.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:46):**  Not always, not every farm is the same way, you know, farmers that have a good rotation  
**[1:21:52-1:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:52):**  for example have, you know, put the alfalfa in there periodically.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:56):**  You can take this thing back uphill, but on average across much of the Midwest, you know,  
**[1:22:05-1:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:05):**  farmers that had 6% organic carbon now have 2%.  
**[1:22:09-1:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:09):**  So you're saying like at certain points you could have clay protect organic matter?  
**[1:22:14-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  Caps go around it.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:16):**  Or I could take that oatmeal and I could throw stuff in saying I'm gonna make it hard for  
**[1:22:20-1:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  microbes to eat it.  
**[1:22:23-1:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:23):**  Does that clay always do that 100% of the time for all of time or does it only do that  
**[1:22:31-1:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:31):**  under certain conditions, meaning if I change say the chemical soup of that soil by removing  
**[1:22:40-1:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:40):**  organic matter, adding organic matter, which means acids and stuff are coming or going,  
**[1:22:47-1:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:47):**  does that clay perform differently?  
**[1:22:49-1:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:49):**  So it used to encapsulate it, but now something's changed in the soil, it's not doing that anymore.  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:56):**  Okay, we're back to this time, the evolution of clays with time.  
**[1:23:02-1:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:02):**  So if I start out with these smectites and I evolve to the kaolinite and then I evolve  
**[1:23:09-1:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:09):**  to the oxides, those different mineralogies will behave very differently in terms of their  
**[1:23:17-1:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:17):**  interactions with soil organic matter.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:20):**  But as long as I'm in the smectite realm of the two to one layers, they will behave more  
**[1:23:28-1:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:28):**  or less the same.  
**[1:23:29-1:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:29):**  Now that you can change them by putting in different cations, I can lime the soil or  
**[1:23:36-1:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:36):**  I can acidify the soil, okay, and then that will change its behavior.  
**[1:23:48-1:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:48):**  But it's not going to be radically different unless I go through this longer time scale  
**[1:23:55-1:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:55):**  where the clays themselves evolve from the two to one smectites to the one to one kaolinite  
**[1:24:04-1:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:04):**  to the oxides.  
**[1:24:10-1:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:10):**  One of the big takeaways I'm getting out of this episode is a huge benefit of clay is  
**[1:24:15-1:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:15):**  that cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:19):**  Organic matter also has cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:22):**  How did the two compare, organic matters, CEC versus clays?  
**[1:24:29-1:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:29):**  Well again, the type of clay matters hugely.  
**[1:24:35-1:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:35):**  So if I have a smectite or vermiculite, right, I can have very high cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:24:43-1:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:43):**  If I have kaolinite or gibbsite, I have virtually no cation exchange capacity.  
**[1:24:49-1:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:49):**  So clay mineralogy matters.  
**[1:24:53-1:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:53):**  Organic matter also matters.  
**[1:24:57-1:25:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:57):**  The types of, and organic matter can have both cation and potentially even anion exchange  
**[1:25:07-1:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:07):**  capacity.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:12):**  But the cation exchange capacity, the types of functional groups that add a negative surface  
**[1:25:24-1:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:24):**  charge are primarily what we call carboxylates.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:31):**  So these are, I have to get into chemistry here.  
**[1:25:37-1:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:37):**  So a calcium, sorry, a carbon atom that has a double bond to an oxygen and then a single  
**[1:25:45-1:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:45):**  bond to another oxygen and that other oxygen has another charge to it, a negative charge,  
**[1:25:52-1:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:52):**  and that can be satisfied by a proton, in which case you have an acid, an organic acid,  
**[1:25:59-1:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:59):**  or it could be satisfied by a calcium or calcium or magnesium, right, in which case you've  
**[1:26:06-1:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:06):**  got an cation exchange site.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:11):**  So organic matter can have a lot of cation exchange capacity, but it's influenced by  
**[1:26:21-1:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:21):**  pH.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:23):**  So if I have an acidic cell, most of those carboxyl groups have protons on them and they  
**[1:26:35-1:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:35):**  don't have a negative charge, so they're not contributing much.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:39):**  If I'm more alkaline, most of those protons are gone and I've got a base cation like potassium  
**[1:26:48-1:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:48):**  retained on it.  
**[1:26:54-1:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:54):**  Also organic matter is light and fluffy.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:00):**  Metals tend to be much more dense and heavy, so it depends on whether you say on a volume  
**[1:27:07-1:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:07):**  scale or on a mass scale.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:11):**  Okay, clay on a mass basis has a very high cation exchange capacity, whereas organic  
**[1:27:21-1:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:21):**  matter on a mass scale is way very high, right?  
**[1:27:28-1:27:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:28):**  But on a volume scale, because it's light and fluffy, it's diluted somewhat.  
**[1:27:35-1:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:35):**  So there are ways of looking at it, but it's that light and fluffiness of the humic substances  
**[1:27:43-1:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:43):**  that really helps the soil in terms of its physical properties, its ability to hold water,  
**[1:27:52-1:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:52):**  allow air and water and allow roots to move through it.  
**[1:27:55-1:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:55):**  If I've got massive clay layer, roots can hit that clay and just can't penetrate it,  
**[1:28:02-1:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  go sideways.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:07):**  In that case, what causes that clay, those two clay particles that are sitting there  
**[1:28:14-1:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:14):**  to open up?  
**[1:28:15-1:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:15):**  Is it a physical force?  
**[1:28:16-1:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:16):**  Is it a chemical force that breaks some sort of bond to allow the roots to go through?  
**[1:28:20-1:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:20):**  Why does the root eventually go through?  
**[1:28:26-1:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:26):**  Oh boy.  
**[1:28:32-1:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:32):**  Roots take the path of least resistance, so they'll find a crack or a core and work their  
**[1:28:39-1:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:39):**  way into it, right?  
**[1:28:41-1:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:41):**  If they run into a solid particle or stone, they're going to go around it, not through  
**[1:28:47-1:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:47):**  it, right?  
**[1:28:49-1:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:49):**  If they run into a solid mass of clay, they're going to try and go around it, not through  
**[1:28:53-1:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:53):**  it.  
**[1:28:54-1:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:54):**  But if they find a small pore in there, they may try and get through it, and then as they  
**[1:29:00-1:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:00):**  grow, they'll expand that pore.  
**[1:29:05-1:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:05):**  So the roots play an important role in helping to loosen up the soil, helping to increase  
**[1:29:13-1:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:13):**  its porosity, helping to lower its what we call bulk density, make it a much more habitable  
**[1:29:21-1:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:21):**  environment for plant roots, for microbes.  
**[1:29:25-1:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:25):**  You really need that balance of solids, pores, and water.  
**[1:29:31-1:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:31):**  All of them have to be there in the right proportions to have the best quality soil.  
**[1:29:39-1:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:39):**  Having looked at a lot of clay, doing organic matter, if we take that same gram of clay,  
**[1:29:45-1:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:45):**  I think it's an 800 square meters of surface area, if we had a gram of organic matter,  
**[1:29:52-1:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:52):**  what's the surface area of that relative to a gram of that clay?  
**[1:30:08-1:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:08):**  It could be larger, but let me hesitate to ask, and this brings up the concept of fractal  
**[1:30:18-1:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:18):**  dimensions, you know, what is the length of the coast of California?  
**[1:30:28-1:30:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:28):**  If I draw a straight line, I've got one number, but if I follow the contour of every  
**[1:30:38-1:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:38):**  little bay and inlet, I get a different number.  
**[1:30:42-1:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:42):**  And what do I use as my yardstick for following that contour?  
**[1:30:46-1:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:46):**  Do I use a one mile long yardstick?  
**[1:30:48-1:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:48):**  Well, then I'm going to miss a lot of little nooks and crannies.  
**[1:30:52-1:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:52):**  Do I use a one foot ruler?  
**[1:30:57-1:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:57):**  Then I get a much bigger number.  
**[1:31:00-1:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:00):**  So how I measure the length of the coast of California depends on the ruler that I use  
**[1:31:08-1:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08):**  to measure it with, how much detail I'm willing to look at.  
**[1:31:13-1:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:13):**  The same is true when you talk about surface area, particularly of organic matter.  
**[1:31:22-1:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:22):**  What kind of a ruler, what kind of a, how are you going to measure that surface area?  
**[1:31:28-1:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:28):**  Are you going to get down to an atomic scale and try to measure every little pore, every  
**[1:31:34-1:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:34):**  little bump, or are you going to come in with a much bigger scale to try and measure that?  
**[1:31:40-1:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:40):**  Are you going to use a non-polar probe, a molecule like nitrogen gas, okay, into two  
**[1:31:53-1:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:53):**  nitrogens symmetrical and no charge on there, no polarity on there?  
**[1:32:05-1:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:05):**  That is going to have a harder time probing the surface.  
**[1:32:08-1:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:08):**  Or am I going to use a polar molecule like water, right, as a positive and negative dipoles  
**[1:32:14-1:32:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:14):**  to it?  
**[1:32:15-1:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:15):**  They could penetrate different areas of that surface.  
**[1:32:20-1:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:20):**  So you ask what is the surface area of organic matter and the truth is I don't know.  
**[1:32:29-1:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:29):**  Depends on how I try to measure it, what tool I used, how I define it.  
**[1:32:38-1:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:38):**  But big, big in the realm of clay.  
**[1:32:41-1:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:41):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[1:32:43-1:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:43):**  It could, it is certainly big and probably bigger than clay than the most, you know,  
**[1:32:52-1:32:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:52):**  certainly bigger than clays like kaolinite or gibbsite.  
**[1:32:56-1:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:56):**  You try to put it up against a spectite like mohamutilinite, you know, 800 meters, that's  
**[1:33:01-1:33:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:01):**  a lot, right?  
**[1:33:03-1:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:03):**  But humic materials are probably bigger still.  
**[1:33:07-1:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:07):**  But again, it depends on what probe I use to measure that surface area with, what number  
**[1:33:15-1:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:15):**  I'm going to get.  
**[1:33:16-1:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:16):**  Thank you.  
**[1:34:16-1:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-17-DavidLaird-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:16):**  You

### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 25 Nov 2020 10:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Is this our world?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  Or are we just living inside of their world?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  As humans we like to think that we control everything.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  We're at the top of the food chain.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  But yet everything that we create and build will eventually be taken apart one day by  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  them.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:40):**  They're the ultimate decomposers.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  They turn rock into soil.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  Some of them break down substances in ways that we can't even understand.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  And we wouldn't be here without them.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  Today we're going to take a deep dive into the mystery in the world that is fungi.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:00):**  And to guide you on that journey, I'm joined by mycologist and educator Peter McCoy.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  Whereas most organisms, most animals and things only have one nucleus, one set of genetics,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:10):**  these ones have upwards of tens of thousands.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:13):**  In my mind, they're much like the genetic reserves, the world's genetic database and  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  library in the soil.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  Peter's a teacher at Michael Logos and he's author of the book Radical Mycology.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  He's an absolute wealth of knowledge and walking encyclopedia for all things fungi.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  This is one of those episodes that's intense in a good way.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  There's a lot of stuff that we're going to talk about in this episode that you've never  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  heard of.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  And I think it's safe to say that this is probably one of those episodes that you're  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:50):**  going to have to listen to a few times to get everything out of.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  Because there's a lot here.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  It's deep.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  It's intense.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  Let's go down the fungal rabbit hole with our white rabbit, Peter McCoy.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:06):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:08):**  Today I'm talking to Peter McCoy, author of the book Radical Mycology, teacher at Michael  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  Logos.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  And Peter, it's been a few years since we talked and I was trying to think of, you know,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:19):**  what has changed in the world since then?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  There's a lot of craziness happening out there in the world.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  There's a lot of climate change talkers out there.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:28):**  And one of the things I thought maybe to start this out with was, are there more mycelium  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:33):**  on the planet now than when we talked last, which is probably three or four years ago?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  Like, is mycelium getting more robust as time goes on or are we seeing less of it due to  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:45):**  the activities of man?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  I mean, that's a great question to be pretty hard to measure.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  You know, I always like to believe in the resiliency of fungi.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  I mean, if there's central tenets to mycology is that fungi bounce back and they are great  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:02):**  teachers of the ability to bounce back and what resilience really means in the natural  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  world.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  And so, you know, even despite the harshest conditions that the natural world brings about,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:13):**  including extinction level events, fungi seem to always sort of be the pioneers to come  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  back from the greatest detriments to environments and spaces.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  So even what humans are doing, even though some of it might be fairly novel in the history  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  of the Earth, I would like to think that if not the fungi that were in the place before  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  was disturbed or the ones that come back, you know, another group of fungi come in to  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  fill the niche that the many niches that fungi fulfill, because without them, you know, life  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  can't really kickstart.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  You have those extreme spaces, the really bad superfund sites and brownfields and things  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  where it seems like nothing's really alive, although there is always some sort of weed  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:51):**  plant growing and, you know, there might very well be fungi there.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  And perhaps that's where we can come in to actually, of course, facilitate the acceleration  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  of what would naturally occur if given time.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  And so all that's to say that while I can't necessarily quantify it, I don't think fungi  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  are going away anytime soon.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  You know, even the worst things that humans might ever do to the planet or the temperatures  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  go off the charts more so than we've ever measured or recorded human history, I think  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  fungi will still find a way.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:21):**  And that's what we find in all the fossil records and all the great extinction level  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  events.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  Fungi, there's a thicker layer in the fossil bed implying that they sort of dominated the  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  planet, turned the nutrients around and enabled the next big generation to move forward.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  And that's one of the things that's always given me, I think, a really solid and true  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  sense of hope in maybe some longer term geological timescale when things might look a little  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  bit more bleak on the immediate human timescale, just kind of knowing that no matter what fungi  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  will persist, you know, life goes on and the nutrient cycle and, you know, again, things  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  have a way of bouncing back and adapting in another major tenet of fungi is not just resilience,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  but evolution slash adaptation to new challenges.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  So we do find effects of the things that humans do to the environment, which we can, of course,  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  certainly get into, and changes of soil temperature due to climatic changes are affecting not  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:17):**  only plant populations, but fungal populations.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  And this is being slowly tracked in a handful of studies.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  So certainly there's concern there for their patterns, the fruiting patterns of mushrooms  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  is a more measurable effect.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:30):**  We can see, you know, the season goes longer, the mushrooms fruit later.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  This is going to affect nutrient cycling, insect populations, herbivores who eat, and  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  small mammals who eat the mushrooms, their populations and everything that comes after  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  that.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  So there's big questions there and certainly things we were going to be wondering about  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  and maybe to some degree worrying about.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  But we always, I mean, for me at least, you got to kind of hope that things iron themselves  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  out to some degree with fungi often pioneering or helping show the way.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  Yeah, I think as humans, you know, we have that kind of God complex that we are the tail  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  that wags the dog and we're small in the big scheme of things.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  And I think it was in your book, your Radical Mycology that I was reading that something  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  like we produce 7% of the CO2 that's in the atmosphere is human related and something  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  like 85% of it's coming out of the soil might not have been in your book.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  I think it was, but I thought that was a pretty remarkable fact that really a lot of that  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  CO2 is coming out of the soil and people don't think that normally.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not one to be discussing or really arguing about greenhouse  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  gases.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  You know, they say that CO2 is actually not as bad as some of the other ones, methane  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  and things.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  But as far as the CO2 goes, the lion's share, yeah, by far, I thought it was more than 85%.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  I have it more in like by the tons, by billions of tons is the metric I give.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  But still it's the vast, vast majority is coming out of the soil, but just sort of generally  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  through deep fungal decomposition, fungal respiration is the thought fungi respire and  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  release CO2 as a part of their cellular metabolism, just like we do.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  But their their tissue and their volume is in such higher amounts throughout the world  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:19):**  that they are they're producing so much more than even all of our industries and everything  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  combined.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  So it's it's an interesting, you know, again, I can't draw any conclusions.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  I don't know.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  I'm not a climate scientist, but it's interesting to think, well, how much have we added in  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:33):**  just the last couple hundred years of industrial civilization?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  What have you to just tip that scale?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:37):**  I mean, I don't know the numbers, but it is it kind of just puts things in a different  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  perspective.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  You know, and you realize, you know, CO2 is super critical for all of life and it's almost  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  a different way to not fear it.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  I mean, obviously, we should be concerned about what we're doing in all the ways and  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  where does that CO2 come from and the other effects of the industries and the automobiles  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:55):**  that produce the CO2.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  They're also producing all kinds of other stuff.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  But just as far as CO2 is like we sort of simplified it like that's the problem.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  It's kind of an easy, easy way to bottle it all up.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  But it's a critical, you know, gas, a critical molecule in life and plant life.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:10):**  And it's produced by one of our best allies, the fungi.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  So if you think about that, I mean, fungi producing CO2 plants consuming CO2.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  You have the cycle there.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  It's really us living in their world.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  Yeah, I mean, one of the ways I truly think about fungi and sort of ecology broadly and  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  humans placed in the world is that we, the human system, the humans and mammals and higher  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  animal, pretty much all animals are really a subsystem of the fungal system that has  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  been here for much longer, for billions of years longer, and is really in so many ways  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  sculpting the world around us.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  I think a lot of people, for good reason, historically have focused, of course, on the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  flora and fauna, the more visible organisms.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  And then in more recent decades, the bacteria and those organisms in the soil and their  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  role.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:59):**  Fungi have always just throughout their short history as a science, mycology rather, has  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  been just sort of swept aside, overlooked because we don't really know much and we  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  didn't know to look there.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:09):**  But the whole paradigm shift that comes with studying fungi is that as you learn more,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  they kind of just seem to take center stage in any conversation.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:16):**  You can sound biased, but the science just kind of keeps leading back to that conclusion.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  And in everything they do, especially throughout the soil, the nutrient cycling, yes, bacteria  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  play a part in the insects and everything plays a part, of course, but the things that  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:30):**  fungi do and sort of the way they do it, we can argue that in especially certain ecosystems,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  they're critical.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  I mean, they're just they're at the center of these webs.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:38):**  And without them, if you removed the fungi, everything falls apart.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  They are the keystone, the grand connectors.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:45):**  And because of that, everything ripples out, essentially, sort of especially from the soil  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  where they're doing a lot of the most important work.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  Then we're, as humans, as dependent on the natural world, especially more so historically  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  and still today, of course, through all the things we engineer, we wouldn't have all  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  the resources we take advantage of without fungi kickstarting so much of these processes.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:07):**  And it's just it's a different twist.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  It's a way to there's a lot of reasons I like to play that, put that picture in the world.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  When I walk out almost anywhere, even on the sidewalk, I can see fungi in the cracks and  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  sort of think about what they're doing there.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  But it still just sort of helps you take a step back, reassess your assumptions, look,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  try to look at things differently.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  And and then just especially from the sort of myco centric or myco informed and inspired  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  perspective, just kind of always wondering, OK, well, what could they be doing?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:37):**  And all these things we don't know as you learn more.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:39):**  It's one of those things you realize what you don't know and what we all don't know  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:42):**  scientists, the scientific community doesn't know, not just mycologists, but sort of all  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  scientists based on their lack of knowledge about mycology as a rule of thumb throughout  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:51):**  all of academia.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  And it kind of again, kind of brings up this hope for me.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:55):**  And I think a lot of people where you realize, OK, even though we're told all the time,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:59):**  you know, scientists sort of figured everything out and, you know, this is how it's looking  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:03):**  for the future.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  You can come back and say, well, we still actually don't know all this stuff about fungi.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:08):**  And as we discover more, there are actually tons of possible positive, very optimistic  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:13):**  solutions that they can offer some good tools for our toolboxes.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:16):**  And let's not throw in the towel just yet, because it seems like there's a lot we haven't  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:21):**  applied in a human system type setting or even just gone to sort of assess or understand  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  or try to try to measure out the natural world.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  And again, the more we uncover that papers keep coming out all the time.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  It's such a young science.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  It just keeps reinforcing this perspective, these new sort of paradigms for me and other  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  people that again, fungi are sort of the rulers of the world, the secret society of the world  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:44):**  in some respect.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  I mean, thinking about your book as an analogy here, it's 600 and something pages long.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  If this represented all the knowledge that we have of fungi now, how many pages into  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  the book are we right now?  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:58):**  Well, that's the thing is we don't know what we don't know.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  I mean, it really comes out.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:02):**  We're at the beginning really of mycology.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:07):**  I like to think one of my big interests, I see two major pillars in the world of mycology.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:11):**  We have the fungal ecology and the big questions there.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:14):**  And then the human intersections, the ethnomycology.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:18):**  And that both implies historical relationships throughout history and cultures around the  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  world, which is interesting to me, but also today applying our understandings from fungal  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  ecology to human systems and to different industries and taking there's a lot of applications  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:35):**  that kind of just to put it short.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:38):**  And it's again, one of these things we're not only discovering so much about the fungal  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  ecology, we're also looking further into the past or revisiting the past, revisiting our  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  assumptions about human culture, seeing fungi being incorporated in ways anthropologists  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  never thought to think about or to question.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  And then again today, more and more young people, entrepreneurs and creatives and scientists  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:58):**  seeing new applications of fungi in the things that we do as humans in a totally new perspectives  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:06):**  as unprecedented applications.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  We live in what I like to call the fourth major era or chapter or volume or what have  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  you in the human fungal story.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  The first chapter being sort of all of antiquity, all of traditional cultures working with fungi  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  a bunch of different ways and means.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  And that's the biggest chapter.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  Then we had the start of modern mycology as a science roughly 200, 250 years ago.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:33):**  And that was mostly focused on trying to largely name mushrooms and lichens to some degree  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:37):**  because they were more visible and then later molds and yeast when we had microscopes.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  And then in the mid 20th century, culturally we shifted with the psychoactive fungi and  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:46):**  better cultivation skills that paralleled and came alongside that and went eventually  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  into gourmet mushrooms and medicinals and things as well.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  And now we have sort of more readily available edible mushrooms.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:59):**  And now in just recent years, it's sort of this transition period over the last 10, 15,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  however you want to measure it, where we've gone from a lot of unknowns ecologically,  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  especially in the cultivation world, it was all trial and error for the last hundred years,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  trying to figure out how to just grow mushrooms because relative to the 10,000 years of plant  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:17):**  domestication, mushroom growing is really on a technical side and more efficient side,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  only about 100, 200 years old.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:24):**  So we hardly knew anything.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  And now we finally come to this point after all of human history where we know so much  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  more about their roles throughout the world than ever before.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  And we have the technology in many different realms to apply that knowledge and be creative  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:38):**  with it.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  And this leads to all this untapped potential that so many people are recognizing.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  And so that's one of the things, I mean, there's many things I love about mycology,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:49):**  but that's a big part of it too.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  It's just we don't know what we're going to find or who's going to come up with what  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  tomorrow and it keeps you a little bit on the edge of your seat.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  Mycology is one of the youngest natural sciences, just from the natural sciences perspective,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:02):**  naming the mushrooms, naming the micro fungi, the moles and the yeast and the soil fungi  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  and figuring out their ecology, that's super young.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  And all the applications, I mean, it's just it's an exploding field.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  And there's been many papers, a good number, all very well written, very articulate and  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  with all kinds of strong arguments for the last 10 years saying, you know, mycology is  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:22):**  essentially the phrase that's been used as a neglected mega science.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  It's a massive field with so much potential for all these reasons I've discussed and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30):**  completely overlooked, completely off of everybody's radar, completely missing from all levels  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:35):**  of education.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:36):**  And you know, there has been concern in the not too distant past among academic mycologists  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  that the science might actually fade from really existence.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  There's very few mycology departments and universities and the funding was going away.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:49):**  I really think that thanks to the Internet and all the reasons that mycology sort of  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:52):**  popping back up or really coming up for the first time in modern history, that won't be  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  an issue going forward.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  But there was almost a window there where there was concern.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:01):**  I think in a lot of ways it became it's cool again.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  And there's that saying, you know, like all the ideas have been thought of.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  There aren't any new ideas.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  And I think the thing that I find most interesting about mycology fungi when it comes to the  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  soil and around agriculture is maybe there is stuff new.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:22):**  Like you could make a new discovery.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  You could tap into something that could really be a game changer.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  And a lot of these hacks, tips, tricks, it's just recycled stuff that kind of works or  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  it's been talked about for a very long time.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:35):**  And here we have this wide potential body of knowledge that we don't fully understand.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  Like you said, we might not know what we don't know yet.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  And that I think is really exciting.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  And when you think about just isolating the fungal world and agriculture, where do you  
**[0:16:53-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  think ag is with relation to its understanding of how important fungi are we in parallel  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  with the rest of the world and the rest of the applications for mycology?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  Or are we a little ahead?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  Are we lagging?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah, you meaning in North America or?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  Yeah, let's say North America, like the Western knowledge in agriculture.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  Do we give fungi their due or are we still like, that ain't important?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  Pour some chemicals on it?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:23):**  Well, yeah, no, no.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  I mean, again, the rule of thumb and it's kind of not to disparage anybody or any group.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  It's just I go into any educational system, any new setting of talking to people, assuming  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:36):**  that most people don't know anything.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  And that's just because, you know, not that I know more or something, it's that literally  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  we don't ever learn.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  Most people don't learn.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  They're on their education systems and on the mainstream media.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  So I come into it, you know, sort of trying to help people start from the beginning.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  What are fungi, the basic definition and trying to just build that language, break down the  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  taboos and the barriers.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  And, you know, they're not all bad and they're really interesting and they're not all psycho  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  active and they have all these benefits and all these things and, you know, sort of normalize.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  And that's what a lot of my work has been for over a decade in many different forms,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  just trying to make this thing not only cool, but, you know, relevant and just as familiar  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  as the notion of bacteria or the notion of backyard gardening of vegetables.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  You know, it's not necessarily for everybody, but we know about it.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  It's socially acceptable.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  It's commonplace and it's taught in school in some form.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  And we are we're getting there, you know, more teachers are coming on board and want  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  to teach their kids and stuff.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  But of course, by and large, people that are, you know, in the world doing things they don't  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  know much.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  And so it's definitely my interest to help shift that, raise awareness and enable skills  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  so that someday I learn from other people and more people are making innovations.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  You know, right now, the world of applied mycology, which is sort of the outside of  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  academia, just doing stuff with fungi in all these different ways.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  It's very small in the world and in North America.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  There's just a handful of folks, you know, really kind of doing stuff and they're great  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  and innovative, but we need so many more.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  You know, there's only so much one person can do.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  And so, you know, I try to do sort of my things, but I've always just been so much more interested  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  in the education and watching the culture grow.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  And, you know, I can't wait for that because more people are going to come up with more  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  ideas than I ever could.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  Right.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  And it's going to be better for everybody.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  And so that applies in kind of almost any realm you can think of.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:25):**  And it depends on what you want to focus on when we talk about mycology and in the realm  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  of sort of food production, if we want to just sort of whittle it down to that.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  You know, mushroom cultivation, edible mushroom, gourmet mushrooms is fairly uncommon.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  You know, globally, the market is dominated roughly a third by the Portobello slash Cremini  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  slash white button mushroom.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  It's all the same species.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  It's fairly agriculturally intensive to grow.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  Or well, the system's designed because it's such a large industry, it's very industrially  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  produced, I guess I should say.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  So it's a bit more removed, less humble than a lot of other mushroom farms, if that matters  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  to you.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  But still, it's also one of the least nutritious mushrooms, in my opinion, one of the least  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:05):**  delicious mushrooms relative to other species.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  Not to say that you can't cook it well.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  So that, you know, that right there is just a big turn off.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  Most people think that mushrooms don't taste good, this is my experience, because they've  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:14):**  either had really like just cold mushrooms from the salad bar, you know, not cooked,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:18):**  which is horrible, or really poorly cooked.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  Most restaurants, in my opinion, don't cook them properly.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  So just right there, off the culinary standpoint, most people just, oh, they dismiss it, and  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:28):**  then I give them a properly cooked mushroom that tastes better, and it blows their mind,  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  they love mushrooms after that.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  In the realm of agriculture, I guess more specifically, not only are the mushrooms not  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  really cultivated heavily, the macro fungi, just the application of, or the ability to  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  utilize essentially almost every, probably all organic waste streams that every agricultural  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:50):**  and animal based system produces, the things that we really can't compost easily, or  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  can't use as fodder, I believe in time we will find a good way to run that through fungi  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  of some form, not only maybe make the, say a really good example is cotton bean, coffee  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  bean holes, which are too tannic for fodder, after fungal fermentation and digestion, it  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:11):**  becomes protein infused and viable fodder.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  Plus, you get mushrooms out of that.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:15):**  You apply that to any waste stream that we produce, and they've shown through the last  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:19):**  century that hundreds of agricultural residues can be used as mushroom substrate.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  If you spread that all across the Midwest and every farmer of every scale and backyard  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  gardener and enable them through having your neighborhood mushroom growing supply store,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:35):**  like you have your neighborhood plant growing supply stores, to take their garden waste  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  or their farm waste and grow another crop out of it, or produce fodder, or produce a  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  mycelium based tabletop or other object, and we close our loop so much more, once that  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  becomes as commonplace again as backyard gardening, I mean, I can't even necessarily imagine  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  or measure the cultural implications and the resource management implications of that,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  let alone hopefully how it might inspire kids or make them see this process, which cultivation  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:07):**  is really strange and unusual the first few times you see it, and I think kids love it  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  and whatever that could lead them to to care about nature more and things.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:16):**  And that's just one example.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  I mean, I could certainly go on, but right there we have a huge loss.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  It's really interesting.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:22):**  I mean, just to think that there's something so integral to the cycle of life, something  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  that there's so much of it around us, and we understand so little that most people,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  like I bet if you just asked most people on the street, what is mycelium, they would have  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  zero concept, and maybe even a lot of people listening to this who are educated on the  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  subject they follow, and I mean, they're still like, well, I kind of know what it is.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  It's that white stuff in the ground.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  And one quote that I saw, and it's in your book, I saw it on your Instagram, blew my  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  mind was, though not often considered in soil assessments, fungal mycelium and the compounds  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:56):**  they produce may be the primary source of carbon for whole soil communities.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  This has major implications for carbon storage strategies and for understanding system dynamics  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  across biomes.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  That blew my mind when I read that, because that's something I had never thought of.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  A lot of people in the regenerative ag movement, it's about carbon farming, it's about carbon  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  sequestration, one, to potentially help with climate change, but two, to also feed soils.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  Like carbon-rich soils are healthier and better for the plants that we want to grow than carbon-deficient  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:31):**  soils.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:32):**  Now, where's all that carbon, or where is a big source of that carbon in the soils?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:36):**  It's mycelium.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  And that, again, it blew my mind when I think a lot of people listening to this in the farm  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  space never would have thought of that before or had heard that before.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah, I mean, there's many types of fungi in the soil.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  Just like the other organisms in the soil, very few of them can be cultured in the laboratory  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:56):**  and studied under isolation.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  And even if they can be, what they're doing under the microscope might be relatively quite  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:02):**  different than how they're performing in community.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:05):**  Still, we know there are many types of fungi, all kinds of decomposers, some simpler molds,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  certainly many types of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and truffles.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:18):**  And that's where, and other mycorrhizal fungi in general, but especially the mushroom and  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  truffles we can see and are a little bit easier to measure in some respect and genetically  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:27):**  sequence.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:29):**  And that metric or that notion, I mean, that was more or less my rewriting of a similar  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:34):**  quote out of a paper discussing mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  So again, it wasn't necessarily me making that up.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:39):**  It's sort of, I believe I hopefully have a citation there for that notion because yeah,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  when I read that, I had the same response.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  The way they said it, this is, and yet it's completely in all soil assessments and ecological  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  metrics of environmental health and soil health is the mycelial community and the exudates,  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  the metabolites they produce, what's their quantity because it is so much food for the  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:04):**  web.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  The notion in short is that the atmospheric carbon is brought into plants through photosynthesis,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  goes through their body and does lots of things to all the fungi that live inside of them.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:16):**  Every plant is a quilt of potentially trillions of fungi that are helping the plant.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  And those are known as endophytic fungi.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  Once the carbon makes its rounds, it'll go down to the root, feed its roots and the immediate  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  rhizosphere people are familiar with.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  But most critically, it goes on to the mycorrhizosphere.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  It incorporates and interacts with the mycorrhizal fungi that are locking onto the root system  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:38):**  and that mycorrhizal, that mycelial network goes on and spreads vast distances and covers  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:45):**  so much more surface area because its individual threads or what are known as hyphae are so  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:50):**  much smaller in diameter relative to even the finest meristem root hair that as they  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  go out, their surface area, just their amount of tissue becomes carbon rich.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:00):**  And then as it grows, it's releasing all kinds of compounds, many of which incorporate  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:05):**  lots of carbon.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  Those are released in the environment.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  That's how the fungus digests and lives in its environment.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  It releases much of its chemistry that feeds other organisms, is left behind as the fungus  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:15):**  accumulates byproducts of digestion.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  So some of these compounds are digestive, some of them are protective.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:23):**  But a lot of waste is left behind.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  A lot of byproducts of the digestion is left behind as well.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:27):**  That includes carbon and it makes it more accessible to other organisms and kick starts  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  some of the branches in the food web.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  But also the tissue itself, as it grows, it branches, older branches in the network that  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  maybe aren't really accessing nutrients well anymore will be sort of snipped off or  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  culled internally by the fungus and it's left behind to die off and it becomes food  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  for the soil.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  And so there's so much tissue, a fungal mycelium in the soil, you've probably heard  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:54):**  the metrics, you know, in every cubic centimeter there's miles of mycelium.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  All that tissue eventually is going to die and it's one of the primarily translocators  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  of atmospheric carbon into the terrestrial earth.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  Yes, the trees do that, they're a grand facilitator, but it's truly the mycelium that  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:11):**  goes across hectares to spread it so much further than a single root system can.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:15):**  And that's the connector.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  And then along the way, the mycorrhizae are doing many other things that add to their  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:21):**  ecological significance.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:23):**  But yeah, the carbon sinking, them being one of the major carbon sources and sinks of soil  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  is, I mean, the implications are huge and again, you're not going to read that many  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  sources.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:35):**  So mycelium itself, what is it made out of?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:37):**  It gets culled, it's not producing anymore, it's left in the soil.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:42):**  What is now in the soil when other microorganisms can come digest that?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:46):**  What is it made out of?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  Well, I mean, the cells of mycelium are pretty similar internally to animal cells and plant  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  cells.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  So they have eukaryotic cells and basic biology concepts, prokaryotes are bacteria with really  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  simple cells and the eukaryotes are more evolved.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  Plants have, so animal cells are just kind of like water balloons and we have all the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:12):**  organelles and the nucleus and things inside that, but we have soft tissue, right?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  Plants have a cell wall that includes cellulose, hemicellulose and potentially lignin if it's  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  a more woody plant and that gives the plant structure to grow upright, flopping over,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:27):**  unless it's a simpler plant.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  And then, and that's one of the distinguishing features of plants is their cell wall structure.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:35):**  Fungi also have a cell wall, so it's an extra layer beyond the water balloon, the cell membrane  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  that contains the internal components, but their cell wall is different from plants.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  So its primary compounds are chitin, it's the same compound that makes up insect exoskeletons  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  and lobster shells.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:53):**  So microscopically it's a very thin layer, but it's still rigid, firm, gives the fungus  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  structure and a bit of protection from the pressures of water or being inside of a log  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:03):**  or inside of the soil.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  And then that's about 10% of the cell wall structure.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  The other 80 to 90% are high weight table sugars and, or excuse me, high weight sugars  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  and not table sugar, so much more complex than fruit sugars or table sugar, a very long  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  chain high molecular weight, very complex sugars.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  And sugars are made up of, they're called polysaccharides and they're made up of monosaccharides,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  individual units of carbon rich rings, tons and tons and tons of carbon.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  And this is what primarily forms the vast majority of the fungal cell wall is, you know,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:38):**  I don't have the exact percentage, but it's a ton of carbon.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  A lot of these sugars are actually what we attribute some of the medicinal effects of  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  fungi to.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  So it's, that's where a lot of that comes from is these sugars, some of these sugars.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  And a lot of that, again, just folds away and is easy to be digested by microbes.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  It's essentially a sugar, the bond between each of the monomers is the same type of bond  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  you'll find in simple fruit sugars.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:01):**  You just have many of them strung together in one super long chain, whereas simple sugars  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  are just a few of these monomers and they're fairly short.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  And so that's a lot of what's left behind.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  Again, 80 to 90 percent of the whole cell wall, you know, a lot of the fungal structure,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  what makes it unusual or different from other organisms is this material.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:21):**  And I guess, well, I guess just last bit for the people that want all the details on the  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  exterior of it, this a little bit more, it's pretty interesting.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  There is also a thin layer of proteins which are fairly hydrophobic.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:35):**  And so it actually repels water.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  And it's actually thought that this helps the mycelium glide through its substrate more  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  easily because it's sort of sliding through it and pushing stuff away, which has an effect  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  on the qualities of mycelium as a structural material.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  It makes it fire retardant, actually it makes it more buoyant and things.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  But that's more of an aside.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  No, no, it's great.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  It's totally cool how this all works.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  And I mean, the remarkable thing about fungi is all these layers, along with other things  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  happening within the organism itself, make it hard to penetrate while it's living.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:09):**  It culls off.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  Given how kind of the soil cycle works, is a lot of that stuff going to be bioavailable  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:16):**  to the other organisms in the soil when it's no longer there?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:20):**  Or are you going to need other fungi to come digest the old fungi so then other organisms  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  can get access to that?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  Or when it sloughs off, is it kind of fair game for other things in the soil that might  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:31):**  want to have targeted it when it was alive, but now it's not?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  I mean, when mycelium dies, or even probably when it's alive too and can't fend for itself  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:42):**  really, it only can really defend through the release of chemicals.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  It doesn't have appendages or anything like that or fingers or mouths or anything.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:52):**  Insects do come along and micro insects and things in the soil and other microbes will  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:58):**  eat the fungal tissue and just chomp right through it.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  The tissue passes through the digestive tract of the insect, becomes its waste.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  Other microbes then come and eat that waste, and here's a big part of the soil web.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  But generally the fungi, they can't really fight off insects so much other than maybe  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:15):**  trying to create noxious compounds and things.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  Generally their defense mechanism is, as I said, the release at their growth tips as  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  they're growing into a branching network.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  And at the tips, all kinds of chemicals are being released, including antibiotics, antifungal  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  compounds to fight off other fungi that might want to attack it.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  There are fungi that do hurt other fungi and can penetrate and kill them while they're  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:37):**  alive, which we can actually talk about that as an important group of soil fungi.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  And then also antivirals.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  So there are viruses that can attack fungi.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  But there, I like to think of fungi as nature's greatest chemist.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  And I know a lot of plant folks won't necessarily agree with that, but a lot of the chemistry  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:54):**  inside of plants we're finding is actually produced not really by the plant, but at least  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:58):**  directly or initiated to a pretty good degree by the internal fungi inside of the plant.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  And that's just a whole new realm of discovery and a different discussion perhaps.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  But so they're just incredible chemists, I guess, is a short story.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  And part of that is exemplified through their ability to defend and adapt and grow in all  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  conditions largely through, essentially entirely through the production of their unique host  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  of and suite of chemicals.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  For a lot of the fungi that pair up with plants, do you have any sense of how much of the carbon  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  that makes them up is coming from the plants?  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  Are they 100% dependent upon those plants to survive?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  That's where they're getting the carbon.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:41):**  Or can they synthesize that themselves from other organic matter in the soil?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  Well the rule of thumb, when you get introduced to mycorrhizal fungi, we can start there.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  The endophytic fungi that live inside of plants, there's just lots of questions around how  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:58):**  they operate and a lot of the nutrient exchange, big, big questions there.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  So I can't say so much about those fungi, although I do imagine certainly they're getting  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  tons of their carbon.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  I mean that's essentially their host that's feeding them and then they provide a lot of  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  effects and compounds to the plant as an exchange.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  So I'd imagine, I mean I can't imagine where else they'd be on their food actually.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:18):**  I mean they're getting probably all of it from their plant host in large part.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:22):**  But as far as the mycorrhizal fungi go, they are much more conclusively studied and much  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  more directly studied.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  And the rule of thumb you'll hear with mycorrhizal fungi, there's seven categories of them.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  And the bottom line they always tell you is that all the carbon, the reason it happens  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  and works is the fungus draws in water and minerals and maybe other nutrients including  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  say nitrogen from the environment through its vast mycelial network with the high surface  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:47):**  area that I described brings that to its plant partner.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:49):**  And in exchange the plant provides excess photosynthesized sugars and that's the tradeoff.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  And that does seem to be holding true for most types of fungi.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:58):**  One of the exceptions, I think one of the better exceptions is, and there's kind of  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:04):**  two, is the arycoid mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  These are the fungi that associate with I'm pretty sure all ericaceous plants, all plants  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  in the Arokaceae.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:15):**  And these fungi and plants often live in very acidic soils, really extreme northern climates,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  heathlands and things like this and bogs.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  And the fungi through their chemistry help to buffer the soil pH so that nutrients don't  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  get locked up, minerals don't become unavailable.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:34):**  And at the same time when the plants in the surrounding environment, sometimes you'll  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:37):**  have a heathland that's just all heath pretty much.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  And when the plant dies the same fungus is the one responsible for digesting the plant.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  The plant right next to it or what have you and then feeding it to this other plant.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  So in that case they're actually the ones taking in the carbon and moving it and feeding  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:53):**  the plant.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  The exchange is going the other way that it's not supposed to.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:57):**  In that case this is another example where the arycoid mycorrhizae have been considered  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  and called the drivers of these whole ecosystems.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  Because without them they are the ones completely essentially creating in large part the carbon  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  cycle.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  Sure there is some carbon coming in through photosynthesis but so much of it is being  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:13):**  cycled through the soil and all the chemistry effects via these fungi.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  Another good example of how it can go backwards or the wrong way is with the monotrophoid  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  mycorrhizae.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:24):**  And these are fungi that are associated with the plants in the monotropa.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  The non-photosynthesizing, you know the pink, the white plants, ghost piping things.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:35):**  And so these plants are not photosynthesizing yet they're surviving.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  They need carbon so they must be getting all of their carbon or the vast majority maybe  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:43):**  a little bit from other microbes or something but the vast majority from their mycorrhizal  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  partner.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  And this association is only formed with a small number of fungi, monotrophoid mycorrhizal  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:53):**  fungi, monotrophoid mycorrhizae.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  But what's curious about them, just to put a twist on it all, is those fungi need to  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  be getting their carbon from somewhere and so they're not able really to get it out of  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:04):**  the soil rather they are connected over, you know, here's the ghost pipe, here's the fungus  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  in the middle and over here's the tree.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:10):**  And the tree comes down, forms what's called an ectomycorrhizal relationship.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  The structure looks different, all that's going on in the root fungal interaction is  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  very different but it's the same fungus and then over on this other end it's the monotrophoid  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:23):**  association.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  The structure is different, how it interacts with the root is different, how it looks is  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  different, same fungus.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  And it's essentially a conduit in feeding and keeping these plants alive.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  And they frame it as, and they call it a parasitism, they say that these plants are being mycotrophic  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  and they're feeding off the fungi.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  I mean, you know, it's a way to frame it.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  I like to think that there's a reason this happens, that the fungi are smart enough or  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  what have you that as they evolve they wouldn't have let this parasitism to occur.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:49):**  There are other parasites of course throughout nature and maybe that's all that is but I  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  like to think there's something to it and some reason they keep these interesting plants  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  alive and there's some other exchange.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  But generally for, you know, the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, the mushroom and truffle formers  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:04):**  as well as our arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which are some of our most critical soil fungi,  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  they seem to be heavily if not entirely dependent on their plant partner for survival primarily  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  especially through the carbon acquisition.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  Yeah, and if we just start talking like that commonly cultivated plants that form relationships  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:23):**  with AB fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, one quote that you have in here is, roots  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  are essentially porous anchors that primarily stabilize the plants and serve as a beacon  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  and platform for the beneficial microbes and fungi that actually produce and provide much  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:40):**  of the plant's nutrition.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  So let's say we have a plant that needs that AB association with it, we remove that, what  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:51):**  is that plant now left to do on its own and what can it do on its own?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:56):**  Is it just photosynthesizing and are the roots not taking in these minerals in the soil because  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  the microorganisms aren't there to hand them essentially off to the roots?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  Can you shed any light on what's going on there?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  Well I mean you got to again imagine that a root network, we've all seen the diagrams,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  they look different, they come in different forms but essentially they're limited to accessing  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  what's immediately on the right in the exterior of the root.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:29):**  You know there's diffusion, when there's a rain there might be some osmosis or things  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  dissolve and then it washes over the root and it can sponge up a little more.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  That's what happens when we pour liquid fertilizers on our plant, oh it's getting a little bath  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:40):**  of nutrients and it just sponges that up.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  I'm sure it could be contradicted by somebody who's much more educated in plant chemistry  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  but by and large plants aren't releasing many compounds that dramatically transform nutrients  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  and decompose wood matter right into base elements for its survival.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:59):**  Plants have evolved and we can talk a lot about fungal evolution and it's an open and  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  shut case for me if we want to get into there but plants have evolved from the beginning  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  to be entirely dependent on fungi inside and out and some have become better at being what  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  we call weeds, more surviving without so many other partners and more extreme soils and  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  things but still they probably have internal fungi for sure and would probably not stray  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:23):**  away from the addition of fungi if they were given the choice.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  But you take away the microbes and microbes do a lot of bacteria and stuff of course do  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  a lot of too but the unique thing about fungi is they're filamentous and you do have filamentous  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  fungi microbes actinomyces and things that form networks but the way the fungi do it  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  their structure, their diversity, their chemistry arguably is much richer or the chemical skill  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  set and their ability to travel so far, connect other plants, move nutrients from one plant  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  that's really healthy to a plant that's deficient and that's certainly been shown in lots of  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:55):**  studies talking about that.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:56):**  You don't really find that so much with the bacteria it's not as a dynamic or complex  
**[0:40:59-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:59):**  relationship and so the plants are again from the get-go from day one they've been just  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  helped heavily by their microscopic partners so why would they have evolved to need to  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:12):**  do anything else?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  They do their skills well and the other organisms do the other skills.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:17):**  Now we've come along as humans especially in more recent centuries totally upended that,  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  protected the soil dynamic, destroyed the soils, removed all these organisms, the plant

**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  rot other fungi just essentially come in to shake things up and say this is an unhealthy  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  system and I need to cause succession which is what they do throughout nature is another  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40):**  major role of fungi and we try to fight that off and say that they're bad we don't look  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  at the underlying problem and then we try to bandage it with all kinds of you know of  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:47):**  course chemicals and pesticides and also try to just feed the starving plant and waste  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  a lot of it as a lot of it gets washed into the groundwater or locked up in the soil and  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  we waste tons of nutrients and phosphorus when from the get-go if we only have you know  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  the good natural soil that the plants evolved to be in something much more you know rich  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  all the things we want from soil and then as a part of that a healthy soil community  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:13):**  of all the members of the soil web with fungi being pretty critical in their own unique  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:17):**  ways. So yeah we you know we people often refer to the rhizosphere and but by and large  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  you know unless you're in a totally sterile soil or in a really heavily you know destroyed  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  soil where there is no life by and large we're actually should be talking and always thinking  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:32):**  about the mycorrhizosphere and most plants are mycorrhizal especially in a natural setting  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  and all these dynamics that I'm mentioning are occurring in an incredibly dynamic four-dimensional  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  relationship. So the succession meaning over time these change every root hair could be  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:48):**  constantly changing in just a few days and other fungus is there and it's a lot going  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  on. So yeah when you lose so yes you can come into your field or your garden and inoculate  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:57):**  with five species from a commercial product you're not nearly gonna have the diversity  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  you would have in a in a you know more normal soil healthy soil natural soil that has dozens  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:07):**  hundreds of species doing many processes that aren't necessarily directly mycorrhizal but  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:11):**  maybe producing other compounds that stimulate the plants or other microbes and all these  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  interlocking webs and you know without knowing very much about this we know so little really  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  about these more complex dynamics we're kind of playing the Russian roulette right where  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:26):**  we take stuff away and think like oh let's just strip it down to its simplest form and  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  then at some point along the way just everything stops working.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  Thinking about this there's most plants form these relationships some don't and when it's  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:40):**  in the vegetable world it's brassicas it's it's beets spinach they don't what's theoretically  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:47):**  the reason why they might not form their relationship when the others do?  
**[0:43:53-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  Well the the they they sort of trick you there um I thought that for a long time too and  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  then you look into it and actually and I could be corrected wrong I haven't seen anything  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:02):**  I haven't found the paper that's conclusive saying you know this one plant doesn't do  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  this but a lot of brassica caseae plants and I would I would not be surprised if all plants  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:11):**  but including brassica casea brassicas form actually a different type of root fungal association  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  what defines a mycorrhiza so they say it's not mycorrhizal and it's not a true mycorrhiza  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  what defines a mycorrhiza is that there's sort of three major components there's an  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  initiation stage a sort of recognition stage that can be measured there's actually chemical  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  signaling that can be measured between these different fungi and the plant root might change  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  its structure to accommodate the entering fungus so that can be detected there's a there's  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  a there's a process once the fungus is inside the root system they'll be and this is the  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  key component there's sort of a dedicated and defined structure and which is supposed  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  in most cases to be the site of nutrient exchange and then the fungus penetrates the plant root  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:54):**  system to some degree and also has external or hyper hyper radical mycelium essentially  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  what goes out of the root into the soil so those three things together is what defines  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:05):**  a true mycorrhiza and then we distinguish the seven major varieties of mycorrhiza based  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:10):**  on those three things the process formed the internal structures maybe how the external  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:15):**  mycelium looks and as well as which fungi might be involved but usually more importantly  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  which plant host is involved like the monotropa or the air caseae is good examples now in  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:27):**  the brazilian brazicas we don't find any true mycorrhiza but what we do often find in a  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:31):**  when possible or healthy enough soil for the plant is what are known as dark septate endophyte  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  high mice fungi excuse me or dse's dark septate endophytes so endophytes are the fungi that  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  live inside of plants there are four major categories of them one of them is the dse's  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  or these and they're only root associating yet root associating the other three varieties  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  are more commonly found in aerial parts of the plant and some of them are found in the  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  roots to a degree but the dse's are primarily in the roots and they they can be in the root  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  they can go out to the environment and are probably performing very similar functions  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  to mycorrhiza they just don't really have a strong initiation moment the root might  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  not really compromise or rather alter itself for that fungal exchange or this their interaction  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:16):**  and there's no defined structure which is the big thing that they say well it's not  
**[0:46:19-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:19):**  a true mycorrhiza but it's probably performing a very similar function so that's when I sort  
**[0:46:25-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  of learned about that is kind of like a big haha like haha laughing and also aha moment  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  so you know again unfortunately the words have sort of been used against us or not used  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  against us but sort of misleading through the definition and but again it sort of proves  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  the point that in my mind that fungi have been there and that was what I was referring  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:46):**  to earlier that even the plants we might think of as weeds that don't need them they still  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  have all kinds of endophytes above ground for sure and might very well also have these  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:54):**  other root endophytes that just aren't commonly talked about unfortunately dse's dark septate  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  endophytes just are really poorly studied so they're actually ecological significance  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  they're their importance for brassicas and things sadly as with so many other looming  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:07):**  large obvious questions in mycology just hasn't really been thoroughly investigated we can  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  talk about them I can say maybe a few points but not really much you know there's a lot  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17):**  of great questions even the viewer just hearing this for the first time might be wondering  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  about this what about this what about this and just the research might not have been  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  done yet unfortunately and that's the state of mycology which again is hopefully going  
**[0:47:28-0:47:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  to be changing in the coming years.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:30):**  Yeah I think that's the thing with a lot of knowledge when we don't know the answer  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  for sure we say well it doesn't do it because we can't prove that it did we can't run  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:39):**  out of a study to point to that shows that it did we just it might we just don't know  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  how to interpret it we can't see it we haven't studied it so I think that's really interesting  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  I mean thinking about this and given your knowledge and familiarity around this subject  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:54):**  does this make sense if you were growing brassicas and you wanted to encourage the fungi to come  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  in that would benefit them you'd want to grow them in the same place as much as you can  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  like as year-round if possible or depending upon climate like just keep them there more  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  or less in permanence because you want to propagate those fungi and they always need  
**[0:48:17-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  a host and that those relationships need to be intact similar with the more common A-B  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:25):**  fungi that are in having relationships with plants let's say lettuce or something like  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:29):**  that you always grow that in the same spot because it needs a live host they cannot even  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:35):**  can sporulate and lay dormant for the next crop but if you're if you're rotating these  
**[0:48:40-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  crops through brassica to something else and you're breaking up the relationships if we're  
**[0:48:48-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  just looking at the micas or the rhizosphere no micas sphere then are we are we doing damage  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  by that crop rotation or should we have crops in the same place which contradicts a lot  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  of traditional ag thinking of crop rotation where we're we're breaking up a lot of these  
**[0:49:08-0:49:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  relationships that are forming below the soil I mean the logic yeah I mean it's I mean it  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:16):**  in my mind draws to what you're you're pointing to a no-till practice and a reduced or different  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  type of rotation practice perhaps maybe you swap out rather than a completely different  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  type of plant in a bed it's just a different brassica the following year you know not being  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  as rich of a plant grower not having nearly as much knowledge about it as yourself or  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  probably many of your viewers I can only say so much about good plant growing practices  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42):**  but I have to imagine that a lot of a lot of that knowledge a lot of that insight from  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  traditional growers developed in this the notion of rotation and all these these things  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  and tilling came in by witnessing plant root pathogens and and and root rot and all these  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  things coming in and again obviously the notion is you want to move it so that you don't establish  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  a problematic organism in the soil and I I definitely have to wonder if those things  
**[0:50:06-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:06):**  pop up just like they do in really any system inside of any unhealthy organism in the environment  
**[0:50:13-0:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:13):**  a predatory fungus or other infectious agent will show up usually because the host is compromised  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:19):**  and in this case not only the plant might be weakened maybe it doesn't have all the  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:23):**  endophytic fungi that it needs and has also evolved to get endophytes are transmitted  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:29):**  in the natural world some live inside of seeds and they're passed through lineages of plants  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:33):**  it's called vertical transmission they carry inside of the seed which I think is pretty  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  incredible but many of them are also horizontally transmitted meaning that in the spores will  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:42):**  drift from basically growing out of a leaf if you will or when an insect bites a leaf  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  it gets some of that endophyte moves the next plant and deposits it and then the the beetle  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:52):**  waste or the excuse me the insect waste will land on the plant there's some viable fungal  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  tissue or spores there and literally just grows between the the the leaf cells and starts  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  to enter the plant that's how these are vertically are horizontally transmitted so in a healthy  
**[0:51:05-0:51:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  forest setting we have such plant diversity every plant and even plants in the same stand  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:12):**  the same species right next to each other they might have a slightly different endophytic  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  community this might very well be why a healthy otherwise healthy tree has a really unhealthy  
**[0:51:21-0:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  branch everything else is fine and the the problem isn't spreading it just maybe that  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:25):**  branch didn't get a good assembly of endophytes or it's missing one of them I don't know  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  and so you know in our monocultures or in a really stripped down agricultural settings  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  where we don't have all the rich diversity of all the plants and insects and stuff moving  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:38):**  all these endophytic fungi around I wonder if that's a big problem you know that's  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:42):**  that's just one of my hypotheses really hard to measure but it could be tested for  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:47):**  I think in a larger scale and then similarly below ground you know of course yeah we lose  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  the mycorrhizal fungi all the benefits they provide there we we disrupt all the community  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:56):**  that the mycorrhizae also need I mean they know hypha is an island you know they they  
**[0:52:01-0:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  need a community to be in and exchange things with not just the one plant one fungus relationship  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:07):**  so certainly the the tillage and the disruption could be playing into that and that's yeah  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  one of the big arguments with them especially mycorrhizal fungi you're trying to establish  
**[0:52:16-0:52:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  them I mean some of the AM fungi some of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi they can persist  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:23):**  I mean their their spores germinate and within you know just a week or two they start to  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  associate with the plant or less and you know within a very short period of time can be  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:31):**  providing benefits to their plant partner and at the end of the season if you till you  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  might lose that that network but if you re-inoculate they'll might very well come back and some  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  of them also could sporulate if given if you don't till too early and they get a chance  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:44):**  to get to their sporulation stage and some of those arbuscular mycorrhizae can survive  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  tillage though generally they don't really survive going to different soil depths than  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:53):**  they're they're meant to be in their spores that is so you know it's it is a bit of a  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:58):**  debate and of course I wouldn't want to tell somebody that's till dependent to swap switch  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  tomorrow but it's a big big conversation and I think it kind of again comes back to what  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  are we what is the actual problem is it that the the root rot is establishing and we got  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:12):**  to sort of run away from them or is it actually is that just a symptom of a greater ill where  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  the the ecosystem or the sort of ecology of the garden isn't right the the endophytic  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  community of the individual plant isn't quite right and yeah these are these are looming  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  questions certainly one in one of the applications one of these sort of leading edge realms of  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  applied mycology more industrial mycology really is creating endophyte inoculum so there  
**[0:53:39-0:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:39):**  are endophytes that are known to dramatically provide drought salinity heat tolerance to  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:45):**  their host plant individual species have been identified from extreme environments and then  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  isolated applied to a commercial crop plant in a greenhouse and transmit similar drought

**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  as the world heats up things dry out big questions there big concerns come along with that for

**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:16):**  inside of the fungus when we start to do all this it's a really compelling topic obviously  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  there's it should be looked at but I just have lots of you know sort of concerns or  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:26):**  reservations around it that are beyond my control someday there's gonna be these commercial  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  products and people are gonna be using them and they'll work but who knows what the long-term  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  effect will be just like with all of our pesticides and things that we just you know don't question  
**[0:54:38-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  yeah so I mean I guess I could go on but you leave it there well tell me if I'm overreaching  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  here so I used to watch the old school Batman as a kid and Batman would always get in trouble

**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  that fungi being the chemists that they are they are Batman they are ever resilient they're  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  trying to be attacked they're trying to be shut down but they find a way if I just look  
**[0:55:08-0:55:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08):**  outside we look at history nature has evolved there's always this cycle of decay and growth  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:15):**  but plants wouldn't be around the planet wouldn't have evolved if if the bad stuff just had  
**[0:55:20-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:20):**  taken over is it safe to assume or could you could you draw potentially draw this conclusion  
**[0:55:27-0:55:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  that if you had a robust soil and above-ground ecosystem that the power of the fungi would  
**[0:55:39-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:39):**  remove a lot of these bad root pathogens from the equation so you wouldn't get the root  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  rot you wouldn't get fusarium that if if those relationships were intact and running at full  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:52):**  speed and everything was good that the good would win and we'd be all good I mean exactly  
**[0:55:59-0:56:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:59):**  I mean if if these if I talked to her was so such an epidemic then you know all plants  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:06):**  it would just be a wave of plant death you know in front of it and nothing could stop  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:10):**  it so what's stopping it when it hits the boundary it's probably helpful fungi that  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:15):**  are well established and protecting their plant partners I mean it's it's a pretty again  
**[0:56:21-0:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:21):**  kind of an open shut another sort of open shut case for me you just look at the studies  
**[0:56:25-0:56:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:25):**  and there's there's decades of research at this point with especially the arbuscular  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:29):**  mycorrhizae as a as a group of mycorrhizae for their ability to to defend and protect  
**[0:56:35-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:35):**  commercial annual crops from phytophthora from fusarium from a lot of them some of the most  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  common root pathogens tons of research easy to look up you know just the the the problem  
**[0:56:47-0:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  is it hasn't been accepted by by big ag for probably any number of reasons and the farm  
**[0:56:52-0:56:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:52):**  you know the chemical companies doing their thing but I think it's also bad application  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:57):**  is is definitely something I suspect one of the problems and challenges with especially  
**[0:57:01-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:01):**  arbuscular mycorrhizae is a great example is that if you over for you you have the fungus  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  as inoculum sure but if you over fertilize the plant or actually give it what's sort  
**[0:57:11-0:57:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  of a normal dose for an average farmer it doesn't need the fungus to do the fungal  
**[0:57:16-0:57:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:16):**  nutrient provision so the fungus germinates the plant won't take it in the fungus dies  
**[0:57:21-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:21):**  because the the am yeah the fungus it has about seven to ten days after spore germination  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  to find and be accepted by planos if it doesn't get that it'll just die on the soil so if  
**[0:57:33-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  you're feeding the plant you know just pouring it on it doesn't doesn't need that fungus  
**[0:57:37-0:57:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  won't waste its resources to feed someone else and then the fungus can't not only die  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:41):**  but then it can't provide that shield of protection and all the defense compounds against these  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:46):**  root pathogens so that's a that's a big challenge you can look at the the good research  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:51):**  by the road Dale Institute on some of their suggestions for not only using you know commercial  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:57):**  sort of industrial fertilizers but also compost and in sort of approximate ratios to apply  
**[0:58:02-0:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:02):**  you're essentially under fertilizing which is going to be concerning for your average  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  grower but you you have to in there their research is a really good resource for creating  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:10):**  commercial or rather home scale or farm scale am inoculum yourself there's a lot to say  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  about that actually go into quite a good bit my book but there's tons of tons to say on  
**[0:58:20-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:20):**  all that well there's there's your problem holding you there I mean in theory if these  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  relationships are intact you're not fertilizing at all because the field across the street  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  that's growing wild is thriving it's trying to take over your cultivation it's not being

**[0:58:43-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  of you know how much do you need to to feed the soil in Minnesota to better you know you  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  provide the food that the fungus can eat to then digest and then feed to the plant there's  
**[0:58:54-0:59:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  there's some good you know thoughts around that not really any any perfect or or really  
**[0:59:00-0:59:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:00):**  definitive protocols although lots of good thinking about adding different you know fatty  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:03):**  acid sources to the soil to to provision the soil is the phrase that gets used to for the  
**[0:59:08-0:59:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:08):**  fungus you know as it works does its work for the planet lots of good questions there  
**[0:59:13-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:13):**  a great notion a really big one especially especially as we start to think about the  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  concerns of peak phosphorus and drying up all our phosphorus mines is rather than take  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:25):**  phosphorus rock all the extraction that goes into that industrially process it into a water  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  soluble form using very strong acids to then create a water soluble form of phosphorus  
**[0:59:35-0:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  we can apply to plants on a obviously non-organic approach rather you which is in that whole  
**[0:59:41-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  approach is essentially mimicking what our vascular mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus  
**[0:59:46-0:59:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  solubilizing bacteria are doing where in the soil if you have the organisms healthy some  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:51):**  phosphate rock these organisms these microbes and fungi release organic acids that slough  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:56):**  off solubilize release phosphorus out of the rock for themselves and for their plant partner  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  and you're dosing it out none is wasted nature does its thing and that's certainly a you  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  know sort of you read this in literature you know kind of do this there's there's not really  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  good perfect protocols or exact numbers there's it's still very much in the realm of we need  
**[1:00:15-1:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  to experiment more unfortunately but that would be yeah as you're sort of saying you  
**[1:00:20-1:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:20):**  wouldn't be wasting what you wouldn't have you'd help reduce especially these inputs  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:23):**  there and if there's enough kind of going around enough organic matter and all the other  
**[1:00:28-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  sort of food sources and all the all the compost we would love to give otherwise you would  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  you would be hoping that the fungi and other food web organisms would be turning all up  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  so we wouldn't have to put in so much more and as the byproduct the plant is well protected  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  and happy and healthy the the alternative to that you know because there are so much

**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  of their difficulty but you know too much to my and maybe many of your listeners surprise  
**[1:02:42-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:42):**  when was last time you heard about trichoderma maybe this audience especially more of them  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  have heard about it but most people haven't in I do see it in the stores you do see you  
**[1:02:51-1:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:51):**  know might not say trichoderma I want to picture this kind of not so pretty mold but if you  
**[1:02:56-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:56):**  see a fungal additive and often with mycorrhizal additives they'll incorporate trichoderma

**[1:03:12-1:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:12):**  I have about these commercial products maybe a little bit deceptive in some way which is  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:16):**  I mean it's fine you're getting so fungi in your soil in you know all better for it I  
**[1:03:20-1:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:20):**  just wish there was you know better practice more awareness on the on the user end so that  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:25):**  you know as awareness and sort of culture on this grows we can have better more informed  
**[1:03:30-1:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:30):**  discussions yeah I guess I'll leave it there you know a lot of people want to speed this  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:37):**  up they want to add something to the soil and put it there assuming it's not there to  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:42):**  begin with in a lot of cases in bad practices it's not there to begin with do you do you  
**[1:03:47-1:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:47):**  have enough faith in nature that if you start growing that these things fungi the trichoderma  
**[1:03:54-1:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:54):**  they will show up even if you're not trying to put them there by doing you know these  
**[1:04:00-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:00):**  more regenerative practices you're not using chemicals you're not using fungicides you're  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:05):**  using crops that are putting a lot of sugars and exudates into the soil my thought is eventually  
**[1:04:11-1:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  like that's going to look attractive to fungi however it gets there it's going to find a  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:16):**  way to get there and say you know I want some of this yeah I mean fungi will always find  
**[1:04:22-1:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:22):**  a way it's just again we have opposable thumbs and a prefrontal cortex to to speed up what  
**[1:04:27-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:27):**  nature would would do over a much longer period of time you know again learning to grow a  
**[1:04:32-1:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:32):**  mold on some old you know newspaper or wheat brand just like indigenous microorganisms  
**[1:04:38-1:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:38):**  something or even simpler just needs maybe to become the another tool in the toolbox  
**[1:04:43-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:43):**  for for folks already doing all these other great skills you just mentioned you know growing  
**[1:04:47-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  the mold is maybe one of the simpler ones it just becomes another amendment by and large  
**[1:04:51-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  you know as much as I've seen there's really no there's we're not really concerned about  
**[1:04:55-1:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  the trichoderma negatively impact impacting crops so you know unless you have like a really  
**[1:05:03-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:03):**  healthy soil fungal my chorizo community you know maybe you don't need to add the the trichoderma  
**[1:05:08-1:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:08):**  there but again if your soil is fairly depleted you're tilling all the time you probably don't  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:11):**  have a lot of established fungi at least doing a little test plot with these trichoderma  
**[1:05:16-1:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:16):**  there's really no risk there and and certainly well worth it and you can buy products that  
**[1:05:20-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:20):**  have it but learning to grow it yourself is maybe something to look into there's even  
**[1:05:27-1:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  methods I mean a bigger concept with with soil and fungal soil inoculum is and the research  
**[1:05:33-1:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:33):**  shows this to be true is that rather than buying commercial products even though they  
**[1:05:37-1:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:37):**  might have a well developed strain or varietal of a given fungus which shows and their work  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:44):**  to be the best one there's a lot of argumentation around well that might be the case harvesting  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  one locally from your local soil system and climate is and then learning to propagate  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:55):**  that out through you know beginner to intermediate techniques is much more worth it and they're  
**[1:06:00-1:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:00):**  more fine-tuned to the soil ecology the climate again elevation all this stuff and and in  
**[1:06:08-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:08):**  some cases especially in more endemic and rare plants that I've seen studies where the  
**[1:06:13-1:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  commercial products did not work and when they harvested the local fungi from the you  
**[1:06:17-1:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:17):**  know special biome or what have you propagated it out in the greenhouse and brought it back  
**[1:06:23-1:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:23):**  then the plant survived whereas the commercial soil inoculum you know may even had a negative  
**[1:06:28-1:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:28):**  effect I've seen that so again more nuances there so you might get all these false negatives  
**[1:06:34-1:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:34):**  or or even a false positive where you think it's the AM fungi but it's actually trichoderma  
**[1:06:38-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:38):**  in the mix or something but so where we it all adds up to maybe more confusion than I  
**[1:06:43-1:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  would like but I think we'll eventually just be clarified as more people you know learn  
**[1:06:49-1:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:49):**  about it and sort of delineate all the terms and and sometimes even though people call  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:55):**  you know the wrong type of fungus the wrong thing and you know just terminology is is  
**[1:07:00-1:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  the stumbling block but we'll we'll get over that in not too much time.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  Well that's it I mean a lot of this seems intimidating and I think a lot of people get  
**[1:07:08-1:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:08):**  like in the weeds really quick in terms of knowledge but I think you go out there you  
**[1:07:12-1:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:12):**  try stuff and and you learn from it and along those lines one way to add beneficial microbes  
**[1:07:20-1:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:20):**  and soils through compost and and one thing I see a lot I see a lot of people commenting  
**[1:07:25-1:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:25):**  on this on YouTube is they're always wanting to speed up compost and from talking to people  
**[1:07:31-1:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:31):**  like Dr. Elaine Ingham her belief is that a lot of soils are more a lot of agricultural  
**[1:07:37-1:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:37):**  soils are heavily bacterially dominated and we need to move that closer to a one-to-one  
**[1:07:43-1:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:43):**  fungal to bacterial ratio where a lot of plants like it so a lot of these quick composts the  
**[1:07:49-1:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:49):**  theory this is my theory kind of piecing together a lot of knowledge is you're composting stuff  
**[1:07:54-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:54):**  real quickly using manures and grass clippings and stuff like that you're getting a lot of  
**[1:07:59-1:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  bacteria in there you're not giving fungi the time to go in to really develop to increase  
**[1:08:04-1:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04):**  the diversity to increase the amount and you're not giving really them the food that they  
**[1:08:08-1:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:08):**  want so if I'm create a quick compost and I'm done in 30 days it might look great it  
**[1:08:13-1:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:13):**  might be this brown stuff is it safe to assume that time is needed to develop the fungi that  
**[1:08:22-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:22):**  are going to benefit the soil or using quick compostable ingredients and a lot of turning  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  where you're generating all this heat do you think you can build up fungi in a pile like  
**[1:08:34-1:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:34):**  that given your knowledge of fungi and how they proliferate?  
**[1:08:39-1:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:39):**  Well I mean you know the first question is what what kind of fungi I mean there's there's  
**[1:08:45-1:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:45):**  a anywhere from 1.5 to 6 million fungal species in the world you know and and many of them  
**[1:08:53-1:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:53):**  live in the soil so that's one of these things I always think about with well we just need  
**[1:08:56-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:56):**  more fungi in our soil what kind and there's a huge questions there because we can we can't  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  isolate some fungi the soil as I said early on and there's there's easy ways to do that  
**[1:09:08-1:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  even the simpler molds and things you know trichoderms one but there's many other molds  
**[1:09:12-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:12):**  you can isolate from the soil and look at and name but then you ask okay well what's  
**[1:09:16-1:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  it doing and so what's its ecological role I don't know it's probably a decomposer you  
**[1:09:21-1:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:21):**  know that's that's what I've been told in some more advanced workshops and things have  
**[1:09:24-1:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:24):**  taken and looking into the literature it's just this is what it is is how we name it  
**[1:09:28-1:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:28):**  it's like okay well what's it doing and it's it's just because again like you I think said  
**[1:09:32-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:32):**  earlier we just we don't actually know it's not anybody's real fault it's just that even  
**[1:09:37-1:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  after decades looking at it's about as far as we've come so and I greatly respect Dr.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:43):**  Lingham's work it's just one of the things I've always thought there when I've seen some  
**[1:09:48-1:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  of her work and some of the people that referenced it and things is just sort of vague references  
**[1:09:52-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:52):**  and again it's it might just be that you know she doesn't know what fungi she's seeing it's  
**[1:09:56-1:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  actually quite difficult inexpensive to sequence it and get the genetics so you just look into  
**[1:09:59-1:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:59):**  my sim and try to make broad categorizations which I totally understand but if we're you  
**[1:10:05-1:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:05):**  know I definitely in the future of love just like with indigenous microorganisms and some  
**[1:10:09-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:09):**  of the Korean natural farming stuff where they're just growing wild molds and adding  
**[1:10:12-1:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  it in you know I'd love to see more fine-tuned research which I hear is occurring in that  
**[1:10:17-1:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:17):**  realm to figure out exactly which species are going on and because once we know that  
**[1:10:21-1:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:21):**  we got we don't know what we're talking about we gotta get our basic grammar down in our  
**[1:10:23-1:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:23):**  terms and which species and then we can look at well and then study them individually you  
**[1:10:28-1:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:28):**  know under control settings they prefer this type of food you know they have a preference  
**[1:10:32-1:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:32):**  for you know there's many different foods in the soil and which ones are eating what  
**[1:10:36-1:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:36):**  and then ultimately when we and then which ratio do we want of these dozens of different  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40):**  fungi and now that's obviously quite complex way too far in the future for us right now  
**[1:10:45-1:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:45):**  when we just want to make it happen but that's where I think we need to start thinking at  
**[1:10:50-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:50):**  least this is where my mind goes with it as far as going back to what your question was  
**[1:10:54-1:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  there is lots of fungi and compost there have been I've actually only found one study and  
**[1:10:59-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  maybe there's something new that I haven't come across but I looked in this a number  
**[1:11:02-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  of times over the years of okay fungi and compost because you get this question every  
**[1:11:05-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  so often there's one that I found where they did all the work they made a normal aerobic  
**[1:11:11-1:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  compost pile and then they also had vermin compost and they compared the fungal communities  
**[1:11:15-1:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:15):**  in both and there was mostly what is just concluded was there was I think 120 in one  
**[1:11:22-1:11:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:22):**  group and 150 different species or taxa and the other group and there was a good bit of  
**[1:11:27-1:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:27):**  overlap and that was pretty much the conclusion of the paper again not a real strong conclusion  
**[1:11:31-1:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:31):**  which one's doing what and which one do we want and when it comes out of the soil or  
**[1:11:34-1:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:34):**  out of the compost pile which one's surviving the soil and do the good things there you  
**[1:11:38-1:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:38):**  know so and ultimately there isn't some perfect protocol to get the most perfect fungi because  
**[1:11:44-1:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:44):**  we still don't even necessarily know which of these mini micro fungi that we find in  
**[1:11:48-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:48):**  compost and soils and molds rather are the good ones so again it's a roundabout way of  
**[1:11:54-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  me saying I don't know but it's sort of the line of thinking we you know just we need  
**[1:11:59-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  to realize that that we don't know and I think it's really important in the realm of mycology  
**[1:12:04-1:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  in all sciences and things to really actually really acknowledge what we don't know so that  
**[1:12:08-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:08):**  the next generation or ourselves can actually answer the question rather than coming up  
**[1:12:12-1:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  with sort of simple or shorter sort of little snippets and for simplicity sake that it eases  
**[1:12:19-1:12:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:19):**  the conversation but it doesn't propel the harder thinking that we kind of need especially  
**[1:12:24-1:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:24):**  in this topic which is obviously very important you know in as much as you know how can we  
**[1:12:29-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:29):**  get the you know again cultivate more fungi in our soils and things it comes back to some  
**[1:12:34-1:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  of the stuff that I was talking about in the last with the last question is you know as  
**[1:12:40-1:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:40):**  far as the molds go they seem to just show up as as compost makers know the more diversity  
**[1:12:46-1:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:46):**  of sources you get the more diverse organisms you're going to get ideally they're coming  
**[1:12:51-1:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:51):**  from healthy systems if you're into the Korean natural farming thing where you're basically  
**[1:12:55-1:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  harvesting wild molds in the forest using rice that sounds great that's a fairly newer  
**[1:13:01-1:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:01):**  realm to me and there's not a lot of research there and I don't you know I'd love to see  
**[1:13:04-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:04):**  that further develop in the west and all that to see how because that seems to be obviously  
**[1:13:09-1:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  a great notion but as far as you know the best practice to get the most fun in your  
**[1:13:15-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:15):**  compost or in your soil there really isn't a great strategy other than you know I'd follow  
**[1:13:19-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  along with with Dr. Ingham says just net recognizing there are some generalizations out of necessity  
**[1:13:25-1:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  I think based on you know what she's maybe able to say or at least for her to translate  
**[1:13:29-1:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  to the beginner as well. Well let me let me hold you there so here's some hard thinking  
**[1:13:34-1:13:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:34):**  on that if we look at soil whatever's in the soil when we start is whatever's in there  
**[1:13:41-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:41):**  if we're not tilling and we're we can't get anything a foot deep in the soil a human can't  
**[1:13:47-1:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  inject it down into there without tools the only thing that's going to end up in the soil  
**[1:13:53-1:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:53):**  is really what plants and soil macro and micro flora put there and leave there so knowing  
**[1:14:01-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:01):**  that that you're going to have the bodies of organisms in the soil and you're going  
**[1:14:06-1:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:06):**  to have roots let's say we just when we're done with a plant that we want we cut it off  
**[1:14:10-1:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:10):**  we leave the roots in the soil and we're going to have all the exudates from plants while  
**[1:14:14-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:14):**  they're growing going into the soil. What does your gut say are the types of fungi you  
**[1:14:23-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:23):**  want to encourage or add to the soil to thrive in that environment knowing that those are  
**[1:14:29-1:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  the food sources? I mean you know again it's it's I would want diversity of any kind of  
**[1:14:38-1:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:38):**  as many fungi as possible you know the unfortunate thing is we because we don't know what we've  
**[1:14:44-1:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:44):**  lost we don't know what all this human activity for the last several hundred or thousands  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:49):**  of years has done to fungal diversity special soil fungal diversity how many species have  
**[1:14:55-1:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  we lost and you know which is a much bigger question and you know you again you kind of  
**[1:15:01-1:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:01):**  bring it back to well so for for that sort of almost from like a philosophical standpoint  
**[1:15:07-1:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:07):**  I just want more fungal world let's spread more of them and get them to proliferate and  
**[1:15:11-1:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:11):**  to not lose their diversity even if we don't understand which what an individual species  
**[1:15:16-1:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:16):**  does you know again you can't and you can't necessarily there's there's not a strong  
**[1:15:22-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:22):**  correlation I guess is to come to try to answer your question is that there I sort of said  
**[1:15:27-1:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  this before where we can name a lot of soil fungi but we cannot correlate or connect them  
**[1:15:32-1:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:32):**  to a greater major ecological function other than just simply oh digest decomposition of  
**[1:15:38-1:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:38):**  you know pollen or something or or an insect shell or something like that and yeah they're  
**[1:15:44-1:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:44):**  they're eating stuff and they all just kind of eat stuff that's what I've been told by  
**[1:15:48-1:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:48):**  and large about most soil fungi the only a handful have been really like heavily looked  
**[1:15:53-1:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:53):**  at because their prominence you know I don't know the history of trichoderma there's actually  
**[1:15:58-1:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:58):**  like it's it's one of these few groups of fungi that's actually gotten lots of attention  
**[1:16:02-1:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:02):**  I don't I'm curious about the history of that at some point some researcher realized how  
**[1:16:07-1:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:07):**  common they are and how like strong they are at fighting fungi put two and two together  
**[1:16:10-1:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:10):**  maybe they could be used in agriculture that's probably something like that and then the  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:15):**  AM fungi rose to prominence amongst the other types of mycorrhizae because of similar reasons  
**[1:16:20-1:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20):**  super common they're the most common mycorrhizal type and have all these implications for ecology  
**[1:16:26-1:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:26):**  and economy so they've been given lots of research but they're they're this you know  
**[1:16:31-1:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:31):**  these are some of the shining stars the vast majority fungi we just have a name for them  
**[1:16:34-1:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34):**  and that's just about it so you know what are they doing which ones we want to kind  
**[1:16:38-1:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:38):**  of I was sort of saying this before which ratio and and how which what food do they  
**[1:16:42-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:42):**  need to grow the best we really don't know I mean and I'm just be shooting in the dark  
**[1:16:46-1:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:46):**  to say anything other than let's you know mirror nature is the best I can come up with  
**[1:16:50-1:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:50):**  my one of the things I was gonna say before and sort of going on the compost question  
**[1:16:58-1:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:58):**  and my friend said this and it's just an interesting notion it kind of comes to what you're saying  
**[1:17:01-1:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01):**  but maybe just a derivative of the last question is he points out that with compost especially  
**[1:17:08-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  cold compost low compost you get a lot of smell and that's implying that the the bacteria  
**[1:17:13-1:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  there it's it's rotting it's you're losing nutrients and things are escaping as gases  
**[1:17:18-1:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  through scent sulfur and things with fungal growth generally you know you very rarely  
**[1:17:24-1:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  get much of a scent you get an earthy scent often you know the worst you get that sort  
**[1:17:28-1:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:28):**  of musty fungal scent and not so much in compost either right and usually a good healthy compost  
**[1:17:32-1:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  it smells good and you can see and we can test we see lots of fungi and and especially  
**[1:17:39-1:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:39):**  mushroom cultivation we there is very there's not a noxious scent for whatever that means  
**[1:17:44-1:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:44):**  at least it doesn't trigger us to not like it and but also not a very strong scent generally  
**[1:17:48-1:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:48):**  coming off of mushrooms or their mycelium so his notion is that they're much they're  
**[1:17:52-1:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:52):**  much better at conserving nutrients fungi don't waste through gas no compost you don't  
**[1:17:57-1:18:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:57):**  you don't really smell as much bad stuff per se but you know you got I don't know a lot  
**[1:18:03-1:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:03):**  of steam coming off maybe there's some things coming away some stuff leaching out you know  
**[1:18:07-1:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:07):**  definitely so you know his argument in this is sort of just leaving it on the table for  
**[1:18:12-1:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:12):**  everybody to consider is maybe in the future our composting systems broadly need to be  
**[1:18:17-1:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17):**  much more fungi based like heavily fungi based than bacterially based or at least they we  
**[1:18:23-1:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:23):**  need to do that right alongside our hot compost bacteria piles and we would not only be cultivating  
**[1:18:29-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:29):**  you know the edible mushroom mycelium but really have a whole new system of just growing  
**[1:18:33-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  lots more kind like what IMO indigenous microorganisms does we just grown lots of mycelium mold mycelium  
**[1:18:40-1:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  they start out with a little box of rice and they expand it through a bunch of steps maybe  
**[1:18:43-1:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:43):**  in the future we'll have a larger scale more elaborate version of that that everybody does  
**[1:18:47-1:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47):**  on their farm or in their backyard which would be really interesting and I don't know what  
**[1:18:51-1:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:51):**  that looked like I don't know what species would be there what methods would be included  
**[1:18:55-1:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:55):**  but we can imagine certainly that that I mean it sounds good sounds right sounds like we  
**[1:18:59-1:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:59):**  should be doing that yeah I mean it's interesting you say that now I'm thinking as we're talking  
**[1:19:03-1:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:03):**  here it's almost as though nobody should fall in love with one style of composting whether  
**[1:19:09-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:09):**  that's long form cold composting or short quick hot composting because if you think  
**[1:19:15-1:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  about what is in the soil you're gonna have all stages you're gonna have some young plants  
**[1:19:19-1:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:19):**  that die you're gonna have some tree roots that are old and eventually they die and you're  
**[1:19:25-1:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:25):**  gonna want fungi that can handle all ends of the spectrum so composting materials that  
**[1:19:33-1:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:33):**  can break down very fast gives you the expansion of one type of fungi composting materials  
**[1:19:41-1:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:41):**  that are a little bit tougher to break down gives you another type of fungi and then composting  
**[1:19:46-1:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:46):**  very woody material gives you another type of fungi and you you have some amount of piles  
**[1:19:51-1:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:51):**  that are all managed differently based on the ingredients because they're all breeding  
**[1:19:56-1:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:56):**  out different fungi and then you add all that to the soil and they'll figure it out but  
**[1:20:03-1:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:03):**  you're never just overloading on one or becoming beholden to one because we don't know yeah  
**[1:20:10-1:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:10):**  I mean it's I mean nature isn't that simple it's you make a great point I mean you're  
**[1:20:13-1:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:13):**  essentially describing decompositional succession which is what we we see on a rotting log you  
**[1:20:19-1:20:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:19):**  get many waves of different types of fungi that come throughout the the many stages of  
**[1:20:24-1:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:24):**  wood decay it's not just one silver bullet fungus doing it all you know again they all  
**[1:20:30-1:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:30):**  they all work in concert there is fungi can do a lot they can't do everything and definitely  
**[1:20:34-1:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:34):**  not one species can do everything and so this is certainly how we need to start thinking  
**[1:20:39-1:20:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:39):**  about it they it's one of the common things I encounter with with people new to mycology  
**[1:20:43-1:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:43):**  or even sometimes someone invested in it is it for whatever reason maybe it's part of  
**[1:20:48-1:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:48):**  our society or something we want to whittle it down to that you know again the magic pill  
**[1:20:52-1:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:52):**  or something and just sort of this is the one to do it all or it's an easy way to talk  
**[1:20:56-1:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:56):**  about things sometimes or wrap our brains around it but you got to think systematically  
**[1:21:01-1:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:01):**  bigger picture you know ecosystem picture and yeah I mean that's what you just described  
**[1:21:07-1:21:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:07):**  is really it's you're just mirroring what we find in decomposition is is many organisms  
**[1:21:11-1:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:11):**  and especially as far as the fungi go which I know a lot more about than the bacteria  
**[1:21:15-1:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:15):**  something it's we have lots of stages there so yeah that would probably be the way to  
**[1:21:22-1:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:22):**  go and and the system that does that will probably look a lot different and be more  
**[1:21:27-1:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:27):**  static than than like a hot compost pile in in that maybe it's more you know carbon heavy  
**[1:21:33-1:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:33):**  and much lower than nitrogen to to try to limit the amount of you know bacteria coming  
**[1:21:38-1:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:38):**  in to to do their thing.  
**[1:21:41-1:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:41):**  Thinking about fungi and you were saying that they're very thrifty they're not wasting a  
**[1:21:46-1:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:46):**  lot when they're breaking down one thing people use a lot to measure compost piles is heat  
**[1:21:52-1:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:52):**  in your experience do you notice any output of heat from fungal breakdown and this could  
**[1:22:00-1:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:00):**  be even observed in like a edible mushroom cultivation lab are fungi essentially not  
**[1:22:06-1:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:06):**  raising the temperature or are you seeing temperature increases when they start to break  
**[1:22:11-1:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:11):**  down and let's just say wood.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:14):**  Well yeah absolutely no it's a common issue in a mushroom farm my farm is actually just  
**[1:22:20-1:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  kind of right behind me right behind this wall but we in the incubation room where the  
**[1:22:23-1:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:23):**  mycelium is growing on the material there's lots of metabolism lots of cellular chemical  
**[1:22:28-1:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:28):**  energy going on and that is dissipated as heat and so you actually have to separate  
**[1:22:33-1:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:33):**  the grow bags from each other because if they're right against each other excuse me they're  
**[1:22:38-1:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:38):**  right against each other they will can cook each other and hurt each other through so  
**[1:22:41-1:22:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:41):**  much heat so it can get quite warm in the incubation stage and you have to ventilate  
**[1:22:46-1:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:46):**  and to lower the temperature so that's that's definitely happening through the natural to  
**[1:22:51-1:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:51):**  just let the heats more readily dissipated depending on the substrate.  
**[1:22:57-1:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:57):**  What's the hottest you'd want that to get?  
**[1:23:00-1:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:00):**  Well in the mushroom cultivation we for most mushrooms we're growing incubating usually  
**[1:23:07-1:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:07):**  we try to maintain it anywhere from 70 to 75 some species you know you might go 80 85  
**[1:23:12-1:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:12):**  but usually when you get to that temperature you're actually putting in energy in like  
**[1:23:16-1:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:16):**  a temperate part of the world where I live you usually need an input energy to get warmer  
**[1:23:21-1:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:21):**  the warmer that it is the faster they'll grow so anyway and depends on how full your room  
**[1:23:27-1:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:27):**  is your incubation space you might not even need an input then you actually need to cool  
**[1:23:31-1:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:31):**  down so but in the 70s is a good incubation temperature in a compost pile I mean there  
**[1:23:37-1:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:37):**  are thermophilic fungi that can survive higher temperatures a lot of fungi are mesophilic  
**[1:23:42-1:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:42):**  just like us we like to live it you know what we consider normal warm temperatures we die  
**[1:23:46-1:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:46):**  above I forget 120 or something like that and same with mesophilic fungi but there are  
**[1:23:52-1:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:52):**  then thermophilic fungi that that primarily live at warmer temperatures and in compost  
**[1:23:56-1:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:56):**  piles and in other thermal vents and things like this warmer environments.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:01):**  Yeah and thinking about you know decomposition wood chips are one thing that's really common  
**[1:24:06-1:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:06):**  and this is something that it comes up a lot I've toyed around with this I'm presenting  
**[1:24:11-1:24:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:11):**  the problem here I'm gonna give you a pile of fresh hardwood wood chips so it's a blend  
**[1:24:17-1:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:17):**  of leaves and branches all ground up and you want to break them down as fast as possible  
**[1:24:24-1:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24):**  that's that's the goal that's what we're trying to do and we can't reduce the particle size  
**[1:24:28-1:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:28):**  by grinding them finer just is what it is how would you go about doing that or how would  
**[1:24:33-1:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:33):**  you think about doing that if you wanted to speed it up?  
**[1:24:37-1:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:37):**  I mean the definitely though my go-to would be your your ever ready ever willing garden  
**[1:24:43-1:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:43):**  giant mushroom staupharia rugosa anyulata especially with the substrate you described  
**[1:24:49-1:24:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:49):**  I mean that mushroom if any of your listeners or yourself has grown it if unless you you  
**[1:24:55-1:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:55):**  know pour poison on it you know it'll rip through almost anything especially fresh wood  
**[1:25:01-1:25:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:01):**  chips but your turnaround there I mean it just raw wood chips is a good example it might  
**[1:25:07-1:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:07):**  still take two years two seasons for it to really become essentially topsoil so it's  
**[1:25:14-1:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:14):**  not by your depending on your your standards your your meter might not be super quick relative  
**[1:25:20-1:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:20):**  to spread those out in a wood lot I mean it's incredibly quick it might take you know many  
**[1:25:25-1:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:25):**  years for that to really fully break down to be not as visible or so that's a good mushroom  
**[1:25:32-1:25:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:32):**  you know again going through the systems we were just sort of discussing perhaps we need  
**[1:25:38-1:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:38):**  a better system the right targeted complex of of molds and well not so much molds are  
**[1:25:44-1:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:44):**  good for for wood decay but rather the white and brown rot wood decaying species which  
**[1:25:52-1:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:52):**  are typically more mushrooms and larger larger more evolved fungi and the staupharia is one  
**[1:25:58-1:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:58):**  I have a lot of experience with it's just such a killer mushroom just eats kind of anything  
**[1:26:02-1:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:02):**  so fast but there might very well be there's roughly 2,000 white rot species and about  
**[1:26:08-1:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:08):**  200 brown rot species and you know maybe there's some that are out there that are just not

**[1:26:32-1:26:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:32):**  makes total sense there's a lot of species to trial there probably some obvious choices

**[1:26:57-1:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:57):**  growing on trees and so they're not going to be like in a hot compost pile or some sort

**[1:27:19-1:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:19):**  we have a lot more data which is where all the cultivation you know the lion's share

**[1:28:33-1:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:33):**  it that wrong sponge amount of water yeah typically I mean again pointing to mushroom  
**[1:28:40-1:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:40):**  cultivation and this is what we find with growing the majority of molds and and other  
**[1:28:45-1:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:45):**  micro fungi on substrates is you're you're going for the depending on the substrate it's  
**[1:28:49-1:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:49):**  a it doesn't always apply actually by definition but the phrase that's thrown around is field  
**[1:28:53-1:28:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:53):**  capacity where it's essentially it's holding as much water as possible without so much  
**[1:28:59-1:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:59):**  filling the void spaces with large water droplets so there's still a bit of microscopically  
**[1:29:04-1:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:04):**  there's airflow material that's saturated so for different growing growing medium or  
**[1:29:12-1:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:12):**  substrates the amount of water and how you sort of measure that usually by feel on the  
**[1:29:17-1:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:17):**  farm will vary a bit roughly it's we say it's between like a 60 to 65 percent moisture content  
**[1:29:25-1:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:25):**  meaning that if you take a hundred grams of the material and you've hydrated it to the  
**[1:29:30-1:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:30):**  point you think it's done and then you dehydrated in the oven it would come out at say 35 grams  
**[1:29:35-1:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:35):**  we've lost 65 grams of water meaning that it was at 65 percent moisture content so those  
**[1:29:42-1:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:42):**  are again sort of starting places pretty good rules of thumb but a lot of fungi fungal cultivation  
**[1:29:48-1:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:48):**  molds or molds or mushrooms usually stick around that range when they're describing  
**[1:29:52-1:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:52):**  the preparation of the media you know what from email and back and forth one thing you

**[1:30:02-1:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:02):**  about you know an anaerobic pile in the center of that pile there's either low oxygen or  
**[1:30:08-1:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:08):**  there's no oxygen because it's just can't get there are there fungi that can operate  
**[1:30:13-1:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:13):**  in ultra low oxygen environments so if you did have that pile go anaerobic could there  
**[1:30:19-1:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:19):**  be some fungi that could operate in there or do they have to wait for the anaerobic  
**[1:30:26-1:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:26):**  bacteria and other organisms to kind of run the course and then soil organisms come in  
**[1:30:32-1:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:32):**  aerate that and then the fungi go in well I mean yeah there's a great example is the  
**[1:30:39-1:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:39):**  yeast that makes our beers and breads it's an anaerobic species yeast our fungi they're  
**[1:30:45-1:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:45):**  single-celled the 99.8 percent of fungi probably are filamentous having a network of mycelial  
**[1:30:53-1:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:53):**  tissue a tiny amount are single-celled yeasts but the yeast that makes our beer and bread  
**[1:30:58-1:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:58):**  is is an anaerobic species there's yeast all over wild plants wild fruits there's yeast  
**[1:31:04-1:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:04):**  everywhere we know very little about the role of soil yeast which is a category of soil  
**[1:31:08-1:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08):**  fungi very poorly studied the soil there's yeast throughout the oceans which is there's  
**[1:31:15-1:31:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:15):**  dissolved oxygen in oceans obviously so the fish can breathe but it's very low oxygen  
**[1:31:20-1:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:20):**  levels you know lower depths and things so there are in and there's anaerobic there's  
**[1:31:27-1:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:27):**  fungi that can also survive filamentous fungi that can survive in anaerobic conditions now  
**[1:31:31-1:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:31):**  again the actual dynamics of which fungi are in those anaerobic cores at which time during  
**[1:31:37-1:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:37):**  the compost succession and progression I don't know in I don't know if that I haven't seen  
**[1:31:42-1:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:42):**  like a paper that's really studied that or looked at that specific question could be  
**[1:31:46-1:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:46):**  interesting and there's some fungi that can also switch between normal respiration and  
**[1:31:51-1:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:51):**  fermentation to to to get their you know chemical energy so but a lot of fungi tend to prefer  
**[1:31:58-1:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:58):**  an anaerobic or excuse me aerobic environment say that pile runs its course it's now top  
**[1:32:04-1:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:04):**  soil we add that to the soil at that point are we just providing nutrients for the soil  
**[1:32:13-1:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:13):**  organisms to feed from where now the a B fungi can go target those and transfer them over  
**[1:32:23-1:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:23):**  to the plant as needed because if the decomposers are done in theory there's nothing left for  
**[1:32:30-1:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:30):**  those fungi to eat they go away so are we adding fungal food I guess is what I'm trying  
**[1:32:35-1:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:35):**  to say when we add that broken down wood chip pile to the soil I mean I don't think the  
**[1:32:44-1:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:44):**  decomposers necessarily go away if you move them from you know the pile over here to the

**[1:32:53-1:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:53):**  depends I mean unless you really like pasteurize the compost after processing or after running  
**[1:33:00-1:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:00):**  it then yeah you'd kill most the organisms through say a pasteurization process but they're  
**[1:33:06-1:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:06):**  not just gonna go even you know the mixing it up and sort of diluting it if you do that  
**[1:33:10-1:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:10):**  with your compost you know some of the some of the tissue will survive their mold spores

**[1:33:20-1:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:20):**  you know how many are so I've been which ones survive and then you know who's who's feeding  
**[1:33:25-1:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:25):**  off of what you know the fungi that are already in the soil how much are they what are they  
**[1:33:29-1:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:29):**  doing with the compost that comes in on a nitty-gritty level I mean we can see positive  
**[1:33:33-1:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:33):**  effects like we can say yeah we had to soil the plant grows better and the the fungus  
**[1:33:37-1:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:37):**  the the arbuscan mycorrhizae are accessing it and helping to some degree but to a certain  
**[1:33:44-1:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44):**  degree a lot of the conclusions you read in these types of studies is just sort of saying  
**[1:33:49-1:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:49):**  we did this and this happened that the exactly why and how is maybe decades of in PhDs worth  
**[1:33:56-1:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:56):**  of actually looking really hard and deep to understand all the mechanisms involved and  
**[1:34:00-1:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:00):**  all the players involved in steps so I don't know I mean again it's these are all vague

**[1:34:23-1:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:23):**  you're adding some compost to the soil but you want to feed the fungi in the soil not

**[1:34:52-1:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:52):**  I mean there's a great book by Michael Phelps, Phillips, Micro-Risal Planet I believe and  
**[1:34:59-1:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:59):**  it's one of the few books that's come out last few years on kind of translating all  
**[1:35:06-1:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:06):**  the technical literature on mycorrhizal fungi to a more lay person he's an orchardist first  
**[1:35:12-1:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:12):**  and foremost and so the book is really written so that you provision the soil to feed the  
**[1:35:17-1:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:17):**  mycorrhizal fungi so that the plant benefits and he discusses quite a number of things  
**[1:35:22-1:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:22):**  in there and that's a lot of this notion is he makes these sort of suggestions and arguments  
**[1:35:27-1:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:27):**  and let's add you know different fatty acid sources I believe may fish emulsion is in  
**[1:35:31-1:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:31):**  there and it's a lot of kind of good ideas and the logic is pretty good but you know  
**[1:35:38-1:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:38):**  he doesn't really have much citations I don't think this stuff has actually really been  
**[1:35:41-1:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:41):**  trialed and as far as I was able to draw from the book I don't know how much you know maybe  
**[1:35:46-1:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:46):**  he does it in his field and this is his notion he thinks this is what's going on but again  
**[1:35:50-1:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:50):**  if you want to whittle it down to where's the numbers where's the science I don't think  
**[1:35:54-1:35:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:54):**  we have a lot of that I don't think he necessarily has so much more it's anecdotal at this stage  
**[1:35:58-1:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:58):**  so that's a good book I would refer to for a really you know a lot of the book is dedicated  
**[1:36:03-1:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:03):**  to this thinking so definitely give him credit for all that and suggest people check that  
**[1:36:08-1:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:08):**  out but a lot of what he's referring to is just you know beyond that is sort of I think  
**[1:36:13-1:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:13):**  more speculative the actual protocols you know he suggests there is a lot of it's coming  
**[1:36:17-1:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:17):**  from the Rodale Institute I referred to earlier they're one of our few good resources that  
**[1:36:21-1:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:21):**  have actually used USDA money for a number of years to work with farmers in the Northeast  
**[1:36:28-1:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:28):**  to try a bunch of things especially with arbusco micro azole fungi and just try to make some  
**[1:36:32-1:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:32):**  progress on this these all these looming questions we have they didn't really look so much I  
**[1:36:37-1:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:37):**  mean you know again as far as I've seen into this this type of really great question of  
**[1:36:42-1:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:42):**  what's the best food we add and you know you give it this one and then you get this exact  
**[1:36:46-1:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:46):**  result I mean that's got to have been done but it's still to date not a great great protocols  
**[1:36:53-1:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:53):**  on it you know I've even been to the International Vesicular Arbusco Micro Azole Culture Collection  
**[1:37:02-1:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:02):**  in West Virginia it's one of the world's collections of arbusco micro azole spores from all around  
**[1:37:07-1:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:07):**  the world it's a dedicated lab tiny facility it's such an important thing that people can  
**[1:37:14-1:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:14):**  go to their website nvam.wvu western virginia west virginia university.edu and there's protocols  
**[1:37:21-1:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:21):**  methods and they have identification information on arbusco micro azole nowhere in there you're  
**[1:37:26-1:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:26):**  going to find you know anything about the right supplements to use and they're one of  
**[1:37:30-1:37:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:30):**  the world's leading you know research centers for this and that was surprising to me these  
**[1:37:35-1:37:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:35):**  types of questions not being answered through all their other information and then I go  
**[1:37:38-1:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:38):**  there thinking that it's going to be a bustling department and that students from around the  
**[1:37:43-1:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:43):**  world come there to study this very niche topic and in the 20 years that they've been  
**[1:37:47-1:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:47):**  there they've maybe had I forget maybe 15 grad students do like a two month stint you  
**[1:37:53-1:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:53):**  know at a time and it's basically just one guy that's been holding down the operation  
**[1:37:57-1:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:57):**  for 20 years really unfortunate when I discovered that and it just speaks to I mean just the  
**[1:38:03-1:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:03):**  lack of funding the lack of research going into an agricultural school with one of the  
**[1:38:09-1:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:09):**  world's leading departments on these incredibly important arguably the most ecologically significant  
**[1:38:14-1:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:14):**  of all fungi is said to be the arbusco micro azole and I got one person on the job for  
**[1:38:18-1:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:18):**  20 years you know it's it's pretty wild.  
**[1:38:21-1:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:21):**  Is that something where you could actually request samples from there?  
**[1:38:25-1:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:25):**  You can you can they that's one of their services they have all types of strains from around  
**[1:38:30-1:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:30):**  the world so they showed me their their fridge it was cool I got a walk in it all their sports  
**[1:38:35-1:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:35):**  and sport collections yeah.  
**[1:38:38-1:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:38):**  Well it's amazing talking about this because it's like you know so much yet we know so  
**[1:38:44-1:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:44):**  little in all of it you know like we kind of have they this is what we should do but  
**[1:38:50-1:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:50):**  we don't know all the fine details we're still kind of 30,000 foot on a lot of this it seems.  
**[1:38:58-1:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:58):**  Yeah I mean that's the thing I mean that's I you know realized this so many years ago  
**[1:39:02-1:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:02):**  it's kind of comes back to I said early on where for me in as much as I might wish to  
**[1:39:08-1:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:08):**  spend lots of time and resources and I do where I can to develop a thought or investigate  
**[1:39:14-1:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:14):**  these these hard-hitting questions I for me and just my personality and I think my skill  
**[1:39:19-1:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:19):**  set really lends more towards the education and it excites me more to await the day when  
**[1:39:25-1:39:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:25):**  there's people much more knowledgeable than myself who would advance all this and answer  
**[1:39:29-1:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:29):**  some of these questions and then you know the science really grows again looking we  
**[1:39:34-1:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:34):**  have I think again and I made this assumption early on in my interest mycology you just  
**[1:39:38-1:39:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:38):**  assume oh lots of people are doing it everybody's figuring out there's a whole world of mycologists  
**[1:39:41-1:39:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:41):**  they're gonna do it you can get that sort of a perception you know watching things online  
**[1:39:47-1:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:47):**  or something like that here and people speak like oh there's so much going on mycology  
**[1:39:50-1:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:50):**  is just totally blown up everything's gonna get figured out it's like well no actually  
**[1:39:53-1:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:53):**  there's very few people doing it and definitely not enough and it's one of the few sciences  
**[1:39:58-1:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:58):**  where on all levels of the science the the citizen scientist is actually welcomed you  
**[1:40:02-1:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:02):**  know and a lot of other sciences they say the you know the academics kind of you know  
**[1:40:06-1:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:06):**  look down on the the the amateur you don't have a degree and we you know your your opinion  
**[1:40:11-1:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:11):**  isn't valid that type of thing not so much in mycology it's like we need more people  
**[1:40:15-1:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:15):**  we need to do it do the citizen science do it in your backyard write a however good of  
**[1:40:20-1:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:20):**  a quality paper that says something inclusive because we everybody wants to know in this  
**[1:40:24-1:40:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:24):**  in this field it's all interesting to us you know I started with more of the mushroom stuff  
**[1:40:28-1:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:28):**  and it just you know as with everything you know you get on well you know with everything  
**[1:40:34-1:40:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:34):**  but for me as time has gone on yeah I've gotten a lot more interested in these types of things  
**[1:40:39-1:40:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:39):**  all the unknowns the soil stuff so fascinating right so critical so foundational and and  
**[1:40:44-1:40:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:44):**  a little bit frustrating with how little we know about what what should be some of the  
**[1:40:47-1:40:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:47):**  most important areas of research in in in all ecological studies in many respects.  
**[1:40:53-1:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:53):**  And people can continue to learn from you with your book Radical Mycology your website  
**[1:40:58-1:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:58):**  MycoLogos here are some thoughts you know for ways I think people could easily get into  
**[1:41:05-1:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:05):**  to starting to propagate fungi you know one you mentioned was indigenous microorganisms  
**[1:41:10-1:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:10):**  they can start cultivating that they can just google that pretty easy to do what are your  
**[1:41:16-1:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:16):**  thoughts on this so a lot of people that I've talked to have this idea of you're adding  
**[1:41:21-1:41:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:21):**  a tea to the leaves of a plant because you want to introduce fungi to the exterior of  
**[1:41:27-1:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:27):**  a plant to provide a protective barrier most likely a lot of times the fungi are already  
**[1:41:33-1:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:33):**  there on a healthy plant so if I have a healthy plant I can assume that there's some sort  
**[1:41:38-1:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:38):**  of fungi on those leaves is there a way that's kind of quick and dirty beginnerish easy that  
**[1:41:44-1:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:44):**  I could take a leaf from a healthy plant cultivate the fungi on that leaf multiply it out and  
**[1:41:51-1:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:51):**  then go back out into my garden and spray that yeah I mean it's again not a really common  
**[1:41:58-1:42:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:58):**  protocol but it'd be very easy to take any leaf and you know if you again just being  
**[1:42:05-1:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:05):**  down and dirty and probably the easiest way to make sure you're capturing something is  
**[1:42:10-1:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:10):**  to either learn to make or buy for a little bit of a markup online a petri dish made out  
**[1:42:17-1:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:17):**  of what's known as potato dextrose agar PDA incredibly common fungal cultivation petri  
**[1:42:24-1:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:24):**  dish medium easy to make but also easy to acquire pre-made and you know you probably  
**[1:42:29-1:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:29):**  get a stack of them ten bucks or ten plates for I don't know thirty dollars say or somewhere  
**[1:42:35-1:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:35):**  thereabouts and I would go to try to be the cleanest room of your house maybe your bathroom  
**[1:42:43-1:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:43):**  if you you know you kind of want to up the level a bit and maybe a little bit above down  
**[1:42:46-1:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:46):**  and dirty but I try to increase your odds a little bit just go to your bathroom maybe  
**[1:42:51-1:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:51):**  after you take a hot shower or spray the room with some Lysol or just isopropyl alcohol  
**[1:42:56-1:42:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:56):**  trying to kind of clean the air a little bit so you don't get mold spores of the air land  
**[1:42:59-1:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:59):**  random randomly landing on the plate and then go in wash your hands maybe spraying a little  
**[1:43:05-1:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:05):**  bit of alcohol isopropyl pharmacy over-the-counter alcohol and just pluck the leaf maybe when  
**[1:43:12-1:43:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:12):**  you pluck it in the field put in a clean ziplock bring it to the bathroom and then just sort  
**[1:43:17-1:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:17):**  of as as best you can put it onto the petri dish and just sort of tap it on there set  
**[1:43:22-1:43:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:22):**  it on there sort of rub it around or just sort of do an impression of it and then lift  
**[1:43:27-1:43:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:27):**  it off and all kinds of fungi are gonna come all kinds of bacteria as well but you'll definitely  
**[1:43:33-1:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:33):**  within just a few days especially if you put in kind of a warmer place you know 70-80 degree  
**[1:43:38-1:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38):**  room yeah just a couple days you'll start to see stuff growing and really anything fuzzy  
**[1:43:44-1:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:44):**  is most likely gonna be some of these fungi on the on the on the leaf.  
**[1:43:49-1:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:49):**  Then once you've done that how do you how do you expand that out what's the next step  
**[1:43:52-1:43:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:52):**  there you think?  
**[1:43:54-1:43:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:54):**  Well you know the there's not like a an easy solution because different ones want different  
**[1:43:59-1:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:59):**  stuff but the the next step I would try again sort of this simplest approach would be to  
**[1:44:04-1:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:04):**  just take some wheat bran from the store get it just lightly moistened so you don't want  
**[1:44:09-1:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:09):**  to overly whatever becomes clumpy and anaerobic and then basically just dump that PDA it'll  
**[1:44:15-1:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:15):**  come out of the petri dish it's sort of like a gelatin or jello disc or hockey puck almost  
**[1:44:20-1:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:20):**  and that should just sort of plop out or use a knife to sort of pop it out and just throw  
**[1:44:24-1:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:24):**  that into the moistened wheat bran and you can do a couple big ziplock bags or even like  
**[1:44:31-1:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:31):**  a you know like a coffee bag or something a little bit more porous but just so that  
**[1:44:36-1:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:36):**  something so it doesn't really dry out but it can also have a little bit of airflow and  
**[1:44:40-1:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:40):**  throw that in there you're basically inoculating the wheat bran with these molds and then not  
**[1:44:44-1:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:44):**  all of them will probably survive maybe one or two will triumph but again in a few days  
**[1:44:49-1:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:49):**  you'll see just myself running through it'll look like a bag of mold and you've cultivated  
**[1:44:53-1:44:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:53):**  it and then from there probably just mix it into your your foliar spray you know mixing  
**[1:44:58-1:45:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:58):**  system or however you do it it's sort of an inoculation an inoculum there dilute it down  
**[1:45:03-1:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:03):**  and then go out and spray it on you know I haven't seen that practice I'm not as well  
**[1:45:09-1:45:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:09):**  versed in foliar sprays and all their different forms as as many other people as other people  
**[1:45:15-1:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:15):**  are absolutely so that'd be something I was trying if I was just kind of going in blind  
**[1:45:19-1:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:19):**  no I love the idea of it it's it's something I might take on it's pretty interesting that  
**[1:45:23-1:45:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:23):**  I mean another easy way for people to plug in compost teas what are your thoughts on  
**[1:45:27-1:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:27):**  that worth the effort are we doing anything are we just making ourselves feel good well  
**[1:45:35-1:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:35):**  again I mean you know I think people do get really good good effects from it my question  
**[1:45:39-1:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:39):**  is you know as far as the fungi go which ones are you breeding I know that you know I've  
**[1:45:45-1:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:45):**  heard that people have tried to make like fungal dominant compost teas and it basically  
**[1:45:49-1:45:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:49):**  it's it's next to impossible the short periods and especially the really violent for lack  
**[1:45:55-1:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:55):**  of better word I guess or active aeration that you're supposed to do or just like a  
**[1:45:59-1:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:59):**  roiling rolling boil that's going to be pretty difficult for a filamentous mycelium network  
**[1:46:05-1:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:05):**  to establish and even if it can you know when I grow my some in a liquid medium but we agitated  
**[1:46:13-1:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:13):**  very little and we we oxygenated aerated for just like 30 seconds every few days so that  
**[1:46:20-1:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:20):**  we don't really rip it apart by so much centrifugal force and disruption so you might be breeding  
**[1:46:28-1:46:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:28):**  some some yeast and things in there that could certainly be worthwhile but the what you're  
**[1:46:34-1:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:34):**  supposed to do to get the bacteria to cultivate in compost tea is not a welcoming environment  
**[1:46:40-1:46:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:40):**  I think for most filamentous fungi so you know it's kind of as much as I could say like  
**[1:46:46-1:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:46):**  I said I have been told not too long ago that somebody was trying to to make they'd spent  
**[1:46:51-1:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:51):**  lots of time and quite a bit of effort to try to make a fungal come fungal dominated  
**[1:46:56-1:47:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:56):**  compost tea and just couldn't that yeah that's kind of as much as I could say about it you  
**[1:47:01-1:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:01):**  know again most I think the law of the research in that arena and I haven't looked into it  
**[1:47:05-1:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:05):**  again nearly as deep as I think some folks I think most of it is more anecdotal by and  
**[1:47:10-1:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:10):**  large and it's it's people just trialing and getting some good results and things but you  
**[1:47:15-1:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:15):**  know my question is always going to come back to you know I just which fungi are there when  
**[1:47:18-1:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:18):**  if we're talking about the fungi dang I wish we could measure them and and you know be  
**[1:47:23-1:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:23):**  more precise on all this but that's my bias I mean in just knowing what you're doing could  
**[1:47:29-1:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:29):**  you breed out a filamentous fungi in a liquid successfully it sounds like yes and would  
**[1:47:36-1:47:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:36):**  you just have to remove that air agitation is that the limiting factor where people yeah  
**[1:47:42-1:47:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:42):**  well yeah so exactly so I mean like like I said I don't you know have the right for me  
**[1:47:46-1:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:46):**  to show but it's very common if if listeners aren't familiar with mushroom cultivation  
**[1:47:51-1:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:51):**  an increasingly popular practice in the last decade is to grow our cultivated gourmet medicinal  
**[1:47:57-1:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:57):**  material mycelium is one of the earlier stages we grow it in a liquid medium and usually  
**[1:48:02-1:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:02):**  pint or half gallon glass jars and it's a simple sugar broth you do you have to use  
**[1:48:08-1:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:08):**  some sterile labby techniques but actually you can do them in your kitchen they've it's  
**[1:48:12-1:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:12):**  become that simple and there's ways to really DIY it and get good results and but then you  
**[1:48:20-1:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:20):**  you're feeding the mushroom sterile sugar water so there's no competitors that can just  
**[1:48:23-1:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:23):**  eat eat eat but you have to provide oxygen because the water like a like a fish you need  
**[1:48:27-1:48:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:27):**  to dissolve the oxygen so it can breathe underwater and we do that by by stirring it you can do  
**[1:48:33-1:48:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:33):**  it by hand by essentially swirling it in your hand in a controlled way to create a vortex  
**[1:48:38-1:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:38):**  or there's a very common lab tool called a stir plate where beforehand you put a magnetic  
**[1:48:44-1:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:44):**  stir bar in the jar before you sterilize it and then this plate has a built-in magnet  
**[1:48:48-1:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:48):**  that spins so you spin the bar inside of the jar that causes the water liquid to spin causes  
**[1:48:53-1:49:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:53):**  the vortex causes the surface tension of the liquid to to break in air oxygen gas to dissolve  
**[1:49:00-1:49:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:00):**  into the liquid so it's very commonplace nowadays in mushroom cultivation to do this and and  
**[1:49:06-1:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:06):**  then we use that as again an early stage in the growing process there's several stages  
**[1:49:10-1:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:10):**  after that now in this type of discussion yes you could easily translate I mean they  
**[1:49:15-1:49:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:15):**  do that industrially this home scale approach is a is a translation a scale down of an industrial  
**[1:49:22-1:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:22):**  approach to cultivating micro fungi mycelium that's been around for about a hundred years  
**[1:49:27-1:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:27):**  first developed I think by Pfizer roughly almost a hundred years ago when they learned  
**[1:49:32-1:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:32):**  that they could cultivate an aspergillus mold in large vats of simple sugar water usually  
**[1:49:38-1:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:38):**  molasses wastewater and things like this and that fungus produces citric acid in in copious  
**[1:49:43-1:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:43):**  amounts and they would use simple chemistry thereafter they'd filter out the mycelium  
**[1:49:48-1:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:48):**  and they would dissolve or precipitate rather not dissolve but precipitate out the citric  
**[1:49:52-1:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:52):**  acid crystals from the liquid that the fungus had released into this nutrient broth and  
**[1:49:58-1:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:58):**  that notion of basically harvesting fungal exudates is now done commonplace commonly  
**[1:50:03-1:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:03):**  across all kinds of industries for leather tanning food and textile processing in it's  
**[1:50:08-1:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:08):**  in your detergents for your clothes so that's very common on industrial scale and this could  
**[1:50:14-1:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:14):**  be easily applied for the just the perfect you know fungal foliar inoculum inoculant  
**[1:50:20-1:50:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:20):**  or spray at least this is probably this is what they're sort of doing with those endophytes  
**[1:50:24-1:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:24):**  I was talking about in in short they're essentially taking the fungus isolating it cultivating  
**[1:50:29-1:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:29):**  it in liquid media and then in these systems I just loosely describe and then they spray  
**[1:50:35-1:50:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:35):**  essentially pure mycelium onto the surface of the plant to inoculate it and that's but  
**[1:50:39-1:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:39):**  these are like kind of targeted endophytes that were originally harvested from the interior  
**[1:50:44-1:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:44):**  of the plant propagated out and now applied to then they like I said earlier in this talk  
**[1:50:48-1:50:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:48):**  they they land on the surface and then they burrow into the plant and establish what you're  
**[1:50:53-1:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:53):**  talking about are plants that that are epiphytic fungi that live on the surface so they're

**[1:51:04-1:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:04):**  those and putting them on they're sort of like an above-ground shield whereas the mycorrhizal  
**[1:51:08-1:51:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:08):**  fungi are a below-ground shield and so again you know which ones are right which proportions  
**[1:51:14-1:51:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:14):**  what's percentages should we just have one probably not which how do we get the good  
**[1:51:19-1:51:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:19):**  combo I mean just starting to look at a healthy plant around you and trying to mimic that  
**[1:51:23-1:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:23):**  maybe using something loosely like what I described of of trying to get it on a petri  
**[1:51:28-1:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:28):**  tradition growing from there.  
**[1:51:30-1:51:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:30):**  So would you spend time with compost seeds or no?  
**[1:51:35-1:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:35):**  Oh I'm you know I'm not gonna knock it I mean I think people get a lot of benefit I mean  
**[1:51:39-1:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:39):**  I'm a mushroom grower so I'm not a plant grower so you know I can't speak from lots of personal  
**[1:51:44-1:51:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:44):**  experience and trying trying everything and trying to comparison so I will leave it up  
**[1:51:47-1:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:47):**  to to people more experienced in that realm but we have to think about again sort of just  
**[1:51:54-1:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:54):**  how these fungi function I think is what I'm trying to bring to the table and actually  
**[1:51:58-1:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:58):**  understanding you know what are we talking about which type of fungi recognizing the  
**[1:52:03-1:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:03):**  diversity recognizing the lack of knowledge that we do have and then which ones do we  
**[1:52:07-1:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:07):**  want to propagate do we actually like I said these these companies are trying to they're  
**[1:52:11-1:52:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:11):**  propagating endophytic fungi and they're essentially doing a foliar spray but not for the surface  
**[1:52:16-1:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:16):**  coating that most you know compost tea people are thinking about they're actually cultivating  
**[1:52:20-1:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:20):**  a fungus that will penetrate into the plant and do something entirely different and you  
**[1:52:24-1:52:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:24):**  know that's we can use these same methods I'm describing it's all sort of when you boil  
**[1:52:28-1:52:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:28):**  down fungal cultivation no matter the fungus there's only a handful of lab techniques  
**[1:52:33-1:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:33):**  you need to know to grow them out then it's the question of how do you apply it and then  
**[1:52:39-1:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:39):**  how does and then and then obviously thereafter you want to do it so it's consistent and gets  
**[1:52:42-1:52:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:42):**  you the result you want well I think of this in like a nature situation we don't know without  
**[1:52:52-1:52:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:52):**  a lot of text what we're breeding how much of it and what it's doing when we add it to  
**[1:52:58-1:53:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:58):**  the soil in a lot of cases so maybe the whole mistake around this is is we're looking at  
**[1:53:05-1:53:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:05):**  this a little bit upside down stop trying to add stuff to the soil the fungi and instead  
**[1:53:12-1:53:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:12):**  provide just a healthy environment for them and let them multiply themselves out and we  
**[1:53:20-1:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:20):**  do that so we focus on just growing plants have a have a nice ecosystem above ground  
**[1:53:27-1:53:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:27):**  which is going to create that ecosystem below ground and just let the fungi take care of  
**[1:53:31-1:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:31):**  themselves and stop obsessing about us forcing the fungi into the soil and putting the ones  
**[1:53:36-1:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:36):**  there because we don't really know what we're doing at the end of the day well yeah I mean  
**[1:53:41-1:53:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:41):**  again the just the challenge I mean that would for me that's definitely the the end goal  
**[1:53:46-1:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:46):**  but the the problem is again we don't really know what we've lost and so we don't know  
**[1:53:53-1:53:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:53):**  you know which we look at what we see today and okay this seems to be the healthy example  
**[1:53:57-1:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:57):**  or the healthiest pattern and we can look to like a dense forest or something around  
**[1:54:03-1:54:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:03):**  where I live and try to but you can't really mimic you know a dense temperate forest for  
**[1:54:07-1:54:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:07):**  your for your vegetable garden so what you know is the next best example of that that's  
**[1:54:14-1:54:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:14):**  local as opposed to you know some other part of the world with a different type of ecology  
**[1:54:17-1:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:17):**  that I'm trying to mimic you know so it is a little bit of you know you you sort of hope  
**[1:54:23-1:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:23):**  for the best but we but at the end of the day we have stripped away so much so I think  
**[1:54:27-1:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:27):**  we do need to bring in some of these fungi because yes in time insect deposits will bring  
**[1:54:32-1:54:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:32):**  in a spore here and there they'll drift along the wind spores travel across the ocean on  
**[1:54:37-1:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:37):**  wind currents the mycelium will travel through the soil the worms will carry it through the  
**[1:54:42-1:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:42):**  soil and and move spores that way which is how a lot of underground fungi do they rely  
**[1:54:50-1:54:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:50):**  on insects and other organisms to move their spores so yes that slowly the drift would  
**[1:54:54-1:54:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:54):**  occur things would go where they need to be nature would would find its balance I just  
**[1:54:59-1:55:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:59):**  don't know how long that might take you know they say in a there's been one study that  
**[1:55:04-1:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:04):**  I've found that postulated based on you know some studies that in a post disturbance forest  
**[1:55:11-1:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:11):**  that it would take roughly 40 years for the ectomycorrhizal mushroom populations to more  
**[1:55:16-1:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:16):**  or less come back to a stable point to where they were pre disturbance that's assuming  
**[1:55:21-1:55:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:21):**  that the disturbance wasn't complete deforestation and soil compaction you know if you if you  
**[1:55:26-1:55:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:26):**  remove the entire plant community that was essential for you know this type of mushroom  
**[1:55:33-1:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:33):**  ectomycorrhizal mushroom to live that mushroom won't come back till that plant comes back  
**[1:55:37-1:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:37):**  and you know how is that plant just going to naturally come back is it going to seed  
**[1:55:41-1:55:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:41):**  going to drift in or you know has the entire surrounding been so deforested that is very  
**[1:55:48-1:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:48):**  it's going to take a very long time and very little disturbance by humans for centuries  
**[1:55:51-1:55:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:51):**  before sure the tree might be established but you know this is the notion of in succession  
**[1:55:58-1:56:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:58):**  where you it's not a circle it's a spiral right you know I think there are patterns  
**[1:56:02-1:56:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:02):**  but things things are moving in some sort of direction you know is there there's no  
**[1:56:05-1:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:05):**  this thing the end goal but there's not true a true complete return that you can never  
**[1:56:10-1:56:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:10):**  truly restore an environment I don't I don't like the term restoration because you can  
**[1:56:15-1:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:15):**  never go back you know we can try to regenerate a disturbed habitat and try to bring it uplifted  
**[1:56:20-1:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:20):**  and bring it back from being suppressed and you know hurt and things but you have to recognize  
**[1:56:25-1:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:25):**  there will be a change over and what can we do to make it sort of the next best iteration  
**[1:56:31-1:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:31):**  of space is only going to be based on the best you know best design best to our knowledge  
**[1:56:37-1:56:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:37):**  approach that we have at this point in history and when it comes to the fungi so much that  
**[1:56:42-1:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:42):**  is shooting in the dark but you know a fallback rule of thumb for me is trying to bring in  
**[1:56:46-1:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:46):**  more as much diversity as possible especially if those diversity fungi is locally sourced  
**[1:56:52-1:56:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:52):**  from other fairly healthy nearby environments to again speed up what nature would do in  
**[1:56:57-1:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:57):**  some sort of geological timescale. No I think that's really well said you know one thing  
**[1:57:03-1:57:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:03):**  that I'm trying to talk to a lot of people about in this series part of it is biocharts  
**[1:57:08-1:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:08):**  a big topic that comes up a lot just thinking from as a mushroom grower I give you a piece  
**[1:57:13-1:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:13):**  of charcoal it's it's mostly carbon it's not pure carbon but it's mostly carbon what do  
**[1:57:19-1:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:19):**  you think fungi look at that like is that a food source is that something they don't  
**[1:57:24-1:57:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:24):**  care for is it is it positive is it a net neutral how do you think that's viewed? Well  
**[1:57:31-1:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:31):**  there's no there's a pretty good amount of research and when you incorporate biochar  
**[1:57:37-1:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:37):**  or just you know char charcoal into soil systems or different fungal inoculum strategies and  
**[1:57:42-1:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:42):**  even mushroom cultivation strategies people have used it as a substrate amendment and  
**[1:57:48-1:57:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:48):**  by and large the results are usually positive from pretty much everything I've seen I think  
**[1:57:52-1:57:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:52):**  in a lot of studies if anything you might find that you know they'll depending on there's  
**[1:57:57-1:58:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:57):**  all different ways it's been applied from remediation purposes to plant propagation  
**[1:58:02-1:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:02):**  to fungal propagation but often the addition of biochar is never really a negative if anything  
**[1:58:08-1:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:08):**  you might not get much improvement they've certainly looked at charcoal after under a  
**[1:58:16-1:58:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:16):**  scanning electron microscope so one of those really high magnification microscopes and  
**[1:58:20-1:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:20):**  after inoculated with fungi and the fungi are burrowing or you know penetrating into  
**[1:58:25-1:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:25):**  the all the pores those pores as you probably know are great reserves for water and for  
**[1:58:31-1:58:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:31):**  metals and minerals they're charged sites so minerals charged atoms in the soil will  
**[1:58:38-1:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:38):**  sort of go on and bind to the sites fungi can go in and through their acids and skill

**[1:58:51-1:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:51):**  South America so long ago because it helped it was a nutrient reserve so it by and large  
**[1:58:57-1:59:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:57):**  it seems to work well there's definitely been studies showing that in a remediation type  
**[1:59:00-1:59:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:00):**  setting that the addition of biochar alongside fungi depending on the the toxin typically  
**[1:59:07-1:59:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:07):**  is helpful and then like in the mushroom cultivation setting it usually it's used it's not it's  
**[1:59:13-1:59:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:13):**  not bioactive it's not like soaked in compost tea to be full of bacteria that would be antagonistic

**[1:59:22-1:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:22):**  this setting where we soak it in water it holds tons of water and it becomes a water  
**[1:59:26-1:59:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:26):**  reserve for the mushroom so that in that translates to a higher yield because one of our limiting  
**[1:59:32-1:59:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:32):**  factors in the grow blocks is how much water it can hold.  
**[1:59:36-1:59:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:36):**  So I mean this has been really enlightening I love the work that you're doing with all  
**[1:59:40-1:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:40):**  things that you're doing my go logos is one of them radical mycology your book it's coming  
**[1:59:46-1:59:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:46):**  out for print again this fall I mean my go logos what is it and why might people want  
**[1:59:53-1:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:53):**  to plug it?  
**[1:59:55-2:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:55):**  Yeah so well I wrote my book a number of years ago after at that point almost 10 years of  
**[2:00:03-2:00:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:03):**  teaching in various capacities and you know in so many ways trying to get people excited  
**[2:00:08-2:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:08):**  about mycology normalizing it opening your eyes to these topics and many more and you  
**[2:00:15-2:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:15):**  know trying to show people what they've been missing out on and what I realized after doing  
**[2:00:20-2:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:20):**  kind of all kinds of events and things is that even if I gave them great starting places  
**[2:00:25-2:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:25):**  they didn't have a good resource to follow up with I mean I tell them my favorite books  
**[2:00:28-2:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:28):**  but having read all of them I knew that they fell short in different ways so I that's what  
**[2:00:34-2:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:34):**  led me to write my book which is sort of the book I always wish I'd had growing up it's  
**[2:00:39-2:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:39):**  the best information my favorite highlights the most useful skills kind of all in one  
**[2:00:43-2:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:43):**  source and but really in as much as I think it's a great starting place each topic discussed  
**[2:00:50-2:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:50):**  is in itself just a starting place on each of those topics on upon which all of them  
**[2:00:55-2:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:55):**  I could elaborate so much more and knew that while writing and after the book came out  
**[2:01:00-2:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:00):**  and was well received realized that you know the next step is to basically take these topics  
**[2:01:07-2:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:07):**  and after having done all the research and writing and you know I had to cut out so much  
**[2:01:12-2:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:12):**  there was I already knew I had so much more I could express and share and so that led  
**[2:01:18-2:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:18):**  me to founding Michael Logos which is the world's first online and in-person mycology  
**[2:01:23-2:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:23):**  school so of course many people have been teaching all kinds of fungi classes on all  
**[2:01:29-2:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:29):**  kinds of capacities for many years and some people do some online stuff but we are the  
**[2:01:33-2:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:33):**  first to really be all encompassing not just in teaching classes that way but we have a  
**[2:01:38-2:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:38):**  certification program we'll be teaming up with universities hopefully the not too soon  
**[2:01:45-2:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:45):**  future things have been gotten a little bit rough this last six months trying to finalize  
**[2:01:49-2:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:49):**  some of the things there so that people can get college credit is what we're looking towards  
**[2:01:54-2:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:54):**  but really trying to not just teach sort of one-off classes here and there although certainly  
**[2:01:59-2:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:59):**  you can take them if sort of like we all first sort of a beginner or hobby level type introductions  
**[2:02:04-2:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:04):**  to cultivation and mushroom foraging and identification but also more advanced courses so if you really  
**[2:02:11-2:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:11):**  want to go deep if you really want to understand the stuff we were talking about here for example  
**[2:02:14-2:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:14):**  is explored as a part of a 14-week fungal ecology deep dive that covers everything nitty  
**[2:02:22-2:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:22):**  gritty with lots of resources citations field projects so it's trying to be you know essentially  
**[2:02:29-2:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:29):**  on par with what I would consider college level courses if you could take the more evolved  
**[2:02:34-2:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:34):**  and more advanced classes but unfortunately those classes don't exist in colleges and  
**[2:02:39-2:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:39):**  so we're trying to provide this as a real academic learning opportunity but also provide  
**[2:02:45-2:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:45):**  those beginner classes the you know one of our most popular ones is the one that's just  
**[2:02:49-2:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:49):**  for the complete beginner you know you may not have heard about mushrooms yesterday and  
**[2:02:53-2:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:53):**  you just don't even know what's going on and so we definitely have one just to totally  
**[2:02:56-2:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:56):**  start there on the easy step and we just have a few open and available right now but definitely  
**[2:03:02-2:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:02):**  there are many more to come so folks can definitely join our email list and social to follow along  
**[2:03:09-2:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:09):**  we're looking towards the end of the year things got sort of paused and delayed for  
**[2:03:13-2:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:13):**  last little while for current conditions but we're on the upswing and yeah looking forward  
**[2:03:19-2:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:19):**  to next year if things go go well to do a lot of in-person stuff as well as well as  
**[2:03:25-2:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:25):**  the online.  
**[2:03:26-2:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:26):**  All right right on man I want to thank you for sharing your knowledge with the world  
**[2:03:30-2:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:30):**  and taking some time today to do it I love the work you're doing and I hope this inspires  
**[2:03:34-2:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:34):**  other people to go out there and be the change when it comes to mycology.  
**[2:03:41-2:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:41):**  Yeah I mean thank you for having me I mean it's it really is true that you know one of  
**[2:03:45-2:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:45):**  the things I say and I have said for a long time and really mean is that it's not so much  
**[2:03:51-2:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:51):**  as true anymore but I think still just depending on the community is that even just being interested  
**[2:03:56-2:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:56):**  in mycology and sharing the stuff you're learning and telling your friends you know tomorrow  
**[2:04:00-2:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:00):**  which you heard today that is a huge step forward for where mycology needs to go.  
**[2:04:05-2:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:05):**  I mean in as much as you're able to invest in the knowledge and learn you know the nitty  
**[2:04:10-2:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:10):**  gritty is up to you but my greatest hope is that we can all just be excited about fungi  
**[2:04:16-2:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:16):**  be aware of them and help sort of spread the awareness spread and destigmatize them and  
**[2:04:22-2:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:22):**  embrace them for all their uniqueness so I love going deep you know real deep and into  
**[2:04:27-2:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:27):**  the weeds a bit on your show where you kind of have a more special platform and an audience  
**[2:04:32-2:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:32):**  who really loves all the details because that's you know there's a lot to love about fungi  
**[2:04:37-2:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:37):**  but all this all the details I think for some of the most incredible stuff shines through  
**[2:04:41-2:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:41):**  so thanks again for letting me go there take everybody there with me.  
**[2:04:45-2:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:45):**  You know the anecdotal like the citizen scientist claims this I mean that's it's kind of like  
**[2:04:51-2:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:51):**  I guess the blessing and the curse right like we need it because it's not being done in  
**[2:04:55-2:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:55):**  universities yet some of it is kind of loosey-goosey woo woo and do you spend time and money chasing  
**[2:05:07-2:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:07):**  that without knowing that somebody isn't just you know making it up.  
**[2:05:13-2:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:13):**  I mean well I mean if you can you know it's I wish the people were more transparent like  
**[2:05:20-2:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:20):**  you said I mean I'm happy to admit when I don't know something I mean that's the only  
**[2:05:23-2:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:23):**  way we're gonna progress as society is people are own up to what we do and do not know as  
**[2:05:27-2:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:27):**  individual it's just like I don't know I'm more proud of myself if I'm honest with myself  
**[2:05:32-2:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:32):**  and audience and it helps the student and you know everybody but apparently a lot of  
**[2:05:38-2:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:38):**  people don't do that so you know I don't really understand that line of thought it doesn't  
**[2:05:42-2:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:42):**  I don't think it serves anybody other than somebody's you know ego I guess.  
**[2:05:46-2:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:46):**  Yeah I mean you know the thing about mycology at least in my experience you know part of  
**[2:05:50-2:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:50):**  the reason I am a little bit more rigid in some respects I used to not be a long time  
**[2:05:54-2:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:54):**  ago and like my book has tons of citations is because I mean I don't know just the mycology  
**[2:05:59-2:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:59):**  community is in my world is so small and there is every most people are very science heavy  
**[2:06:06-2:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:06):**  and because we know so little about fungi and there is a lot of confusion around it  
**[2:06:11-2:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:11):**  I think that the it's kind of clamped down on when because you know the people that know  
**[2:06:15-2:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:15):**  stuff don't want people spreading wrong facts and getting stuff confused so everybody's  
**[2:06:19-2:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:19):**  you know checking each other and be like no that's wrong in a helpful way sometimes you  
**[2:06:24-2:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:24):**  get the ego type people but usually it's just like no we got to get our science really good  
**[2:06:28-2:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:28):**  because we're not gonna everything's getting all messed up if everybody's spitting wrong  
**[2:06:31-2:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:31):**  stuff so I was like you know like with the remediation stuff I used to promote that a  
**[2:06:35-2:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:35):**  lot more and still happy to do that but a huge reality pill I had as well as like well  
**[2:06:41-2:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:41):**  you know it's only gonna progress if actually people understand like how science and chemistry  
**[2:06:45-2:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:45):**  and I you know you can throw spawn at something but like who knows if it's working and we  
**[2:06:49-2:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:49):**  actually do the science about it and it's not as romantic and most people you know most  
**[2:06:54-2:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:54):**  people don't they want the romantic silver bullet easy fix thing that you know they get  
**[2:06:59-2:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:59):**  sold on YouTube and stuff so it's for what I've tried to just the way that I try to approach  
**[2:07:09-2:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:09):**  is kind of like how you know talk about it in this talk in other places is trying to  
**[2:07:15-2:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:15):**  excite people to that that it's also exciting that we don't know enough you know it's it's  
**[2:07:19-2:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:19):**  frustrating but it's also part of the exciting part that anybody can contribute to it tomorrow  
**[2:07:24-2:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:24):**  make the next big breakthrough we need more people doing it I didn't maybe emphasize it  
**[2:07:27-2:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:27):**  quite as much as I could have but that's a big takeaway I always try to give is you can  
**[2:07:33-2:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:33):**  actually make a huge difference one of the few sciences you know I briefly touched on  
**[2:07:36-2:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:36):**  it's one of the few sciences where anybody can make can make and we need more people  
**[2:07:40-2:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:40):**  to make huge contributions make your mark and help everybody I'll help the world out  
**[2:07:45-2:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:45):**  and because we who knows what you will all discover and but that's only going to come  
**[2:07:51-2:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:51):**  through being really clear about what we do and do not know and if you know you sort of  
**[2:07:57-2:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:57):**  tell them a good story because it makes you sound good but it leads people down the wrong  
**[2:08:01-2:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:01):**  direction I mean that's just it's as a teacher I just can't imagine doing that is there  
**[2:08:06-2:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:06):**  anything that that maybe we haven't hit on or that it's kind of short like a one-two-minute  
**[2:08:13-2:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:13):**  thing of like just a my silly or mycology mind-blower something that is just people  
**[2:08:19-2:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:19):**  might not know about mycology mushrooms fungi and you know it's just whoa like one of those  
**[2:08:27-2:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:27):**  types of things if you told somebody one of the mind blowers to me I guess it just one  
**[2:08:32-2:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:32):**  of the most unusual things is the art and we spoke a lot about them is they are bus  
**[2:08:35-2:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:35):**  gonna mycorrhizae they're the most unusual it's not really an application thing it's  
**[2:08:40-2:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:40):**  just sort of like it's so crazy they're so unlike every other organism on the planet  
**[2:08:46-2:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:46):**  that this small group of roughly 300 species is argued and has been strongly argued to  
**[2:08:51-2:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:51):**  be an entirely unique branch on the tree of life and there's several reasons for that  
**[2:08:56-2:09:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:56):**  and the most unusual one is that their spores are are very large visible to the naked eye  
**[2:09:02-2:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:02):**  unlike most fungal spores which are microscopic and you can't individuate them but these spores  
**[2:09:08-2:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:08):**  are so large because they host anywhere from 800 to 35,000 genetically distinct nuclei  
**[2:09:14-2:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:14):**  including the nuclei of other organisms other types of organisms and other types of fungi  
**[2:09:19-2:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:19):**  and groups of fungi so what does this mean you know whereas most organisms most animals  
**[2:09:24-2:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:24):**  and things only have one nucleus one set of genetics these ones have upwards of tens of  
**[2:09:28-2:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:28):**  thousands in my mind they're much like the genetic reserves the the world's on you  
**[2:09:35-2:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:35):**  know genetic database and library in the soil and when you understand that they're moving  
**[2:09:40-2:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:40):**  this genetics all around through what they do and they actually have been shown different  
**[2:09:45-2:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:45):**  species will will fuse together temporarily swap their nuclei between each other and then  
**[2:09:50-2:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:50):**  break back apart which is also not supposed to happen between on species of different  
**[2:09:55-2:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:55):**  kinds you know two different species aren't supposed to be able to mate in this way that  
**[2:09:59-2:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:59):**  also makes them unusual and so they're essentially this totally bizarre genetic barter bartering  
**[2:10:06-2:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:06):**  system below ground and which nucleus out of the hundreds and thousands is taking the  
**[2:10:11-2:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:11):**  lead at a given moment which genetic reserve are they pulling from to you know help this  
**[2:10:16-2:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:16):**  tree over there or you know release this compound over there and how much of that is you know  
**[2:10:23-2:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:23):**  for lack of better word intelligence or based on some sort of genetic memory or an epigenetic  
**[2:10:28-2:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:28):**  response whatever framework you want to use to describe the actions of organisms and you  
**[2:10:33-2:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:33):**  know the the cause and effect of those actions there's something going on here that we don't  
**[2:10:37-2:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:37):**  find anywhere else in the natural world and I had to find I only found this this this  
**[2:10:42-2:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:42):**  fact which is a fact buried so deep in the literature and when I was writing my book  
**[2:10:48-2:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:48):**  I spent quite a long time reading everything I could find every paper on our bus kind of  
**[2:10:53-2:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:53):**  theorize it because the more I read about them the more I realized how unusual they  
**[2:10:56-2:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:56):**  were not just important in all these reasons but all these little factoids and if you read  
**[2:11:00-2:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:00):**  my book I give them a nice big shout out in almost every sentence I have a citation because  
**[2:11:04-2:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:04):**  almost every sentence is sort of unbelievable how about how weird they are but what this  
**[2:11:09-2:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:09):**  for is being probably the the weirdest one yeah it's amazing I mean at the end of the  
**[2:11:13-2:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:13):**  day I mean they're they're more fungi are more like us than like plants and I think  
**[2:11:18-2:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:18):**  people think the opposite yeah I mean the I mean we didn't get the evolution thing which  
**[2:11:25-2:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:25):**  is a huge topic but the you know the it's it's essentially consensus although you're  
**[2:11:29-2:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:29):**  not going to be you know hearing this in school but if you look at the papers and stuff and  
**[2:11:33-2:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:33):**  I cite it all the thought is that bacteria came first on earth fungi or something like  
**[2:11:38-2:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:38):**  them came to eat all the dying bacteria eventually plants and animals evolved out of fungi is  
**[2:11:44-2:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:44):**  the long very long story short and so they're you know they're the first eukaryotes and  
**[2:11:50-2:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:50):**  the more larger organisms evolved out of their initial structures I mean that that itself  
**[2:11:57-2:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:57):**  I think is pretty mind-blowing the first time you hear it too.  
**[2:12:20-2:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:12:20):**  Thank you.  
**[2:12:50-2:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:12:50):**  Thank you.

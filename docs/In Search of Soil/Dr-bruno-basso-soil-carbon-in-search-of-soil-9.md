### In Search of Soil  (2020-12-09)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  Carbon â€“ it's the building block of life.  When it comes to soil, it's critically important.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  But how well do you fully understand carbon when it comes to soil science?  For example, do you know the difference between percent organic matter and percent carbon  in the soil?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  Because there is a difference.  As farmers and gardeners, our goal is to put as much carbon as we can into the soil.  Why is that?  
**[0:00:53-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  Because soil doesn't use carbon, soil actually loses carbon.  Today to answer some of those questions and many more, we're exploring the mysteries  of the soil with Dr. Bruno Basso of Michigan State University in SIBO Technologies.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  Starting your soil one day, this podcast will say, those guys stated that the future will  look more bright because of all this technology coming together and hopefully, yes, that time  is not too far, but you need to build your carbon in order to stay healthy.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  Keep the soil healthy, produce good quality crop.  So there will be a day when you'll get paid for growing crops and putting carbon into  the soil.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  Let's take a glimpse into what that future looks like and join the conversation with  Dr. Bruno Basso.  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  One thing I want to start on today was carbon sequestration.  How do you view carbon sequestration when it comes to soil?  So yes, carbon sequestration is a pretty hot topic.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  It's covered in the media extensively and we should ask why, why is it that?  I would say a soil with no carbon is like a body with no soil.  This is just basically the life of the soil.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  And the goal is to sequester carbon, which meaning taking it from the atmosphere through  the process of photosynthesis.  As you know, we convert the energy from the sun into carbon and carbon is sequestered  
**[0:02:39-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  to by the plants and is accumulated in the soil in two ways.  One is by having roots growing in the soil, that's organic compounds, organic materials,  they stay in the soil.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  And at the end of the growing cycle, when you have anything that we call, you know,  sober residues, you obviously want to keep them in the ground because that's carbon that  was sequestered from the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  And so carbon is sequestered by accumulating carbon by putting carbon in the soil.  Carbon is not generated automatically.  It's actually lost from the soil as a process of microbial decomposition.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  So if that provides a general, you know, ground for you to understand, carbon is critical  because it has so many positive aspects.  And so I'll leave it there for now.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  And again, the goal is trying to keep as much carbon in the soil because think of carbon  as a health source of check.  If you have carbon in the soil, you more on the healthy side.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  If you have less carbon in the soil, you may be running into potential problems.  Obviously depends on the type of systems and the type of management that you do.  You can certainly compensate a lot of the negativity of not having carbon through management.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  So if carbon, as we may continue in this conversation on carbon, it helps retaining water.  And what could it be if you don't have carbon you irrigate, but you may not be able to do  that.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  It may, there is cost involved and there is energy involved and there is a strong component.  So if that helps, that's generally my view, you do want to sequester as much carbon as  possible.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  And because you don't control, you control partially the way the plants grow through  the management, you want to accumulate the roots, but the critical piece is adding carbon  to the soil in many different ways.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  Do you have a sense of a natural system, say a healthy ecosystem that is just out there,  a meadow, a prairie, a forest.  Is there an average net gain or loss in carbon to the soil?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  So plants are using carbon out of the atmosphere and they're putting some of that into the  soil.  The microbes are respiring it.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  They're putting out oxygen.  The plants are putting out oxygen in the process.  At the end of the day, if you put that system in a vacuum, does it balance itself out where  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  if one unit of carbon comes out of the atmosphere, one ends up in the soil?  Yes.  Very, very good question.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible.  Imagine the prairies, you know, imagine virgin land with vegetation, like you said, that  has already at a level of carbon that has a mineral soils may be at saturation.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  So is in balance.  However, you know, through the winter plants die, they grow back.  They sequester as much as is lost if they are at saturation.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  Saturation means roughly about 5% of the soil organic carbon that can be stored.  So prairies don't ever go to 15, 20%, 30%.  That's very difficult.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  Sometimes I even hear all my soil organic carbon is going to 20%.  That's a little bit different.  You have an organic matter compound, but you really were talking about soil carbon, soil  
**[0:06:37-0:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  carbon that remains in the soil that brings all the positive aspects.  Now if you are not a saturation, see it as a bucket.  If you see that and you tilled, you basically have done something to that land.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:53):**  Imagine that land as a jar.  If you open that jar, there it goes, a big flush of CO2 carbon dioxide as a result of  this respiration from microbes, they go into the atmosphere.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  So if the bucket now is just basically you lost, imagine drinking out of a bucket, you  lower.  Now you have a gap and that could be regained.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  So in the accumulation now of doing photosynthesis and basically accumulating roots, now you  slowly building back up because you are now you have a room for it.  The problem in the managed system, you keep bringing it down.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  You keep drinking out of this bucket that you really have little left, but much greater  potential to accumulate.  The problem is what do we do?  
**[0:07:48-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  We put some, we take up, we take as much or more.  And so is this continuous fluctuation.  And that's why I needed to start for you to understand that the example that you started  
**[0:08:01-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  with starts possibly at a saturation and not much more can be gained.  But in general, yes, it can be sequestered compared to the amount of what is lost through  respiration and how can it be by don't touch it.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  Don't touch the soil.  If you touch the soil, you break the aggregates.  And what happens if you break the aggregate?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  You basically open the jar.  You basically open that aggregate of soil that is exposed to soil microbes that they  made out of carbon, they eat carbon and they expel carbon.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  That's basically what they are.  And so this in form of CO2 gets released into the atmosphere.  What we accumulate through virtual, you know, good practices like no tillage or cover crop,  
**[0:08:53-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:53):**  it really depends on where you are in the level of degradation.  If you have room to accumulate, you should do so and maintain it.  Unfortunately, as soon as you break this virtuous cycle and you till or you remove, basically  
**[0:09:10-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  you don't continue doing that, then you start basically dipping in almost seeing as a bank  account, you know, as you accumulate.  But if you keep drawing out more than you put in, then you start losing.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  So I don't know if I was clear, but it's again, the complexity stays on where are you at in  terms of your potential?  When you sequester it and are you keeping it for a long time?  
**[0:09:37-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:37):**  Because these accumulations we're talking, I don't necessarily want to give you numbers  that people may not relate, but a cover crop could sequester, you know, basically, you  know, one, one ton of carbon and depending on the volume and the bulk density of the  
**[0:09:55-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  soil and where you start, it will make a very little bend.  It will be like 1.01 now and it keeps slowly.  So it takes a long time to accumulate carbon.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  And at some point in the conversation, Diego, I think we should address why it's important.  We said it obviously, yes, it is the life, but it has so many positive aspects in addition  to the climate benefits.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  The climate benefit meaning of we all aware of CO2 being much greater concentration than  before simply put that we had how many more cars do we have compared to 50 years ago?  That's petrol that was in the bow of the earth.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  There was carbon in the bow of the earth and now we put it into the atmosphere.  So that remains a stronger sector.  But agriculture plays a role and I see it as a solution rather than a, you know, the  
**[0:10:53-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  problem, even though we do contribute roughly in the range that, you know, ranges between  12, 14 or so, 15 percent of the anthropogenic CO2 is emitted comes from agriculture.  And the majority of that comes from end to end.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  We probably will get there in the conversation about abatement.  But let me just add the positive aspect to that.  If you retain carbon because carbon creates a glue, like a physical glue that the aggregates  
**[0:11:28-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  are glued together.  When water goes in that it retains, it stays there much longer.  The microbes basically can't go in, but the roots can slowly and be able to use this water  
**[0:11:42-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  when it's needed.  So first benefit, a greater capacity of holding water for longer time.  And that's critical because it helps stabilize yields, especially in an environment where  
**[0:11:55-0:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  water may be, you know, more limiting.  As this is the carbon of microbes, they still decompose.  There is a release of nutrients that is also, you know, very, very important in terms of  
**[0:12:08-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  adjusting the possible management that you will add on with fertilizer, which could be  less if you have higher organic matter and the decomposition allows the release of nitrogen.  So they're both properties are physical in terms of again, retaining more water, chemical  
**[0:12:26-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  carton exchange capacity, more nutrients can be used by the roots and then biological because  it increases the activity, the presence of microbes, which have a very strong positive  effect on the overall health of the plants.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  What constitutes carbon saturation in the soil?  Is that a property of the mineral makeup of that soil, so, you know, sand, silt, clay  that is?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  Yes indeed.  Okay, and then when it gets to that saturation point, let's say I have soil X, it's at saturation,  like I can't put more carbon into the soil at that point.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  Does that mean, does that somehow affect the evolution of plant life above it?  Meaning if they were producing 1.1 units of carbon and they needed one, soil can't absorb  that extra 0.1, where is that one going, are plants dying off to basically say, okay, we  
**[0:13:31-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  need to deplete carbon in the soil?  So you frame it correctly that the upper threshold, it is set by the physical properties.  So a soil is composed by about, you know, 25% water, 5% carbon and the rest is mineral.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  Okay, so percentage between sand, silt and clay.  So when you are at that level of roughly in, in fact, they're called mineral soils.  We can go to the Isto soils, the organic, the peat soils where they can go 50% carbon,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  but they become, that's like a mine territory because if you put them and you just almost  look at them by scratching who big release of CO2 they go.  So they can be mitigated and there can be things done to them, but they are so on a  
**[0:14:30-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  very small percentage of areas that they're not going to be a critical piece in the future.  But so this, the, the mineral soils, once they reach this, yes, vegetation is, but the  vegetation what you didn't necessarily plants build carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  So that carbon is, it's not, it's not used.  It's if you don't till it, it remains the way it is.  So roots grow, die off and nothing changes.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  So it's at equilibrium.  There is no extra.  If you put a big change vegetation, the thing is change vegetation requires some change  
**[0:15:18-0:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  of a physical change.  You got to, so if it isn't natural change that, you know, wind brings a different, that's  more a climate related, what temperature and in the prairies there are, there is a, basically  
**[0:15:31-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  an evolution of which species predominates, you know, the grass is over and that's very  important to maintain the, you know, the biodiversity for the benefits of the microbes.  But when you are in situation of saturation, you will very well confirm that the prairies  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  wouldn't change.  In terms of they're, they're balancing themselves out there in equilibrium.  Balancing themselves out.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  The roots they die, they get, you know, rebuilt and that number does not change.  So thinking about that in a cultivation sense.  Now we move to man coming in here.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  Exactly.  And you have a grower, let's say their, let's say their soils were at carbon saturation  due to just good growing practices, whatever that means.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  And they start adding additional organic matter to the soil surface, compost, manures, some  sort of organic mulch.  If the soil is already at carbon saturation, you're adding all this new carbon to the soil  
**[0:16:34-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  what, what happens?  It basically it's lost.  It reaches the term, the term carbon is the element of carbon.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  It remains at that percent.  It remains, if it is a mineral soils, you would increase the organic matter.  You know, you could have, I mean, think of a big pile of manure.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  That's much greater percentage of, you know, organic compounds, but it's different than  the organic carbon as an element that we're saying.  The reason there is not necessarily to worry about that problem.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  It's a good problem to have because 5% organic matter, I mean, 5% carbon is 10% organic matter.  Okay.  There is difference between carbon is organic matter is 58% carbon.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  So we're already looking at 10% organic matter, not being in organic soils and is the soils  hard to see.  If you go to the thumb in Michigan where I'm located, those are 15, 20% organic, but those  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  are PD soils.  Those are, those are is the soils.  They're very different mineral compositions, totally different individuals, totally different  
**[0:17:52-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  beasts.  So it's not a problem that we really face or we worry about, Oh, I don't want you far  from having 5% organic carbon, which means, you know, 10, 4% organic matter.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  You will need to keep adding nutrients.  I mean, amendments in the form of carbon to be able to reach as close as possible.  The secret Diego is that the main issue of what we may do a good job is that we often  
**[0:18:23-0:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  lose that carbon by opening the jar.  And that's very hard to comprehend in terms of saying, well, I have to, I'm a vegetable  grower.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:33):**  You have to fully understand if you don't produce vegetable, we won't be healthy in  terms.  So there is always a trade off.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:40):**  There is, there shouldn't be fanaticism about things.  Yes, you do want to reach that.  You don't want to have a total, what we call soil inversion tillage where you flip, you  
**[0:18:52-0:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  know, marble plow, you basically remove, you just flipped 30 centimeters, you know, a foot  of soil upside down, bringing all the microbes, the activity as you know, it used to be in  the past.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:04):**  So the more heavy source of tillage, if you scrape the surface and you, you basically  your damage in terms of carbon losses is mitigated and it's not very much in terms of losses  because you can compensate by having graded yield and accumulation of roots and adding  
**[0:19:26-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  compounds and because you want to build that soil organic carbon for all the benefits that  we just said, be able to hold water, be able to release nutrients, have healthy soil.  It's just the synonymous of a healthy situation if you have that carbon.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  No, one thing I don't want to get lost in is data at the expense of reality here.  So 5% carbon saturation point, like that sounds great.  You know, you're up at high organic matter content.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  Does that translate for a grower to mean that if you had 5% carbon where you're saturated  in carbon that you would have better plant growth versus if you had say 2.5% carbon?  Is that a fair assumption?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  Like is more carbon, meaning the plants that I'm growing are probably growing to be more  healthy?  That's a very good, very good question, Diego.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  The answer will be probably not as much unless you have a particular situation in terms of  climate.  Okay, so if you are on a relatively good year, if we're talking about California and you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  obviously regave, you wouldn't because you're compensating for that additionality of water  storage that you will get from the soil organic carbon.  And then it will make a big difference if you have the high organic.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  Let's say a vegetable growers in the Midwest that has a relatively good soil, 2% in under  a conditions of good distribution of rainfall.  It's that additional carbon and water storage is a stabilizer for situation.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  When does for situation they're more vulnerable?  When does no tillage, if you hear in the literature, when does no tillage really makes a difference?  In the dry years.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  Understand, so it is that situation.  It's hard to put it in frame, you know, how much yield increase would I get?  Almost nothing.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  If it's sufficiently rainfall, would you still compensate with some manure or some additional  nutrients then suddenly no difference.  You leave that soil alone, you don't touch, you don't put rainfall, you don't do anything.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  If it is a dry year, big difference, 5% wins.  If it is a normal year and a relatively good distribution of rainfall and so on, possibly  not a huge difference.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:10):**  But I hope I make the main, it's in the dry in a more difficult situation.  What about in terms of microbiology?  You know, you or me, there's 10 pizzas there and there's five pizzas.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  You know, five pizzas is great, but man, if there's 10 to choose from, whoa, like we can  really pig out and go nuts.  Is it fair to say microbial life would behave differently at a higher percentage?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  Spot on, spot on.  But the question you asked earlier was immediate change in a yearly in terms of yields.  No, on a long term, a 5% is 100 pizza to choose from.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  It's like 10 menus of 10 restaurants to choose from versus a much smaller.  We have experience and data from the Kellogg biological station at Michigan State University  that has a long term site.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  Basically the no tillage has been accumulating carbon slowly going up, but we're still talking  in the range of, you know, 1.5, 2%.  But the amount of microbial activity and the biodiversity that is present in plots where,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  you know, greater biodiversity of plants, you know, even different, the microbiomes  on plants, we are finding to be extremely important.  That brings eventually a conversation that we may touch on rotations.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  You know, the possibility of changing the type of vegetation that you have in the soil.  That's extremely.  So to provide again the final answer to your question, yes, much broader possibility of  
**[0:23:54-0:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  having the strong guy, the short guy, the fastest, then all the possible qualities of  these microbes be able to satisfy, you know, bringing the nutrients all in the water versus  more of a limited food.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:09):**  But you play with what you have, but you identify correctly that the winner is in the expanded  portfolio of microbes and micro, yet microbiomes.  You know, through a lot of the work that you've done, let's say, well, we know a lot of cultivated  
**[0:24:32-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  soils are degenerative and they're low on that carbon saturation point.  Are there specific plants or crops that are net carbon sequesterers, like they are going  to end up putting more in than they take out at the end of the day?  
**[0:24:53-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  Okay.  So that question, like the complexity behind it, it depends on if you isolate a plant by  itself without management associated with it is one story.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  If you manage, so the example that obviously comes natural would be a corn plant, right?  You know, a corn versus a native, a switchgrass or a native, a mix of native vegetation.  Now corn, if it is managed properly, can reach a significant amount of biomass that is accumulated  
**[0:25:36-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  and still one of the king of the crops.  It sequesters more carbon than a forest at saturation because you will, saturation meaning  that has already growth.  
**[0:25:47-0:26:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  But even yearly when you accumulate the woods, what does the forest brings in terms of sequestering  the leaves, then the leaves come.  So that's to put it in numbers, a forest request about eight tons and a corn crop on average  
**[0:26:01-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:01):**  will be at least 20 tons.  But is it a net?  No, because corn uses fertilizer and then that goes down the drain already, the emissions  
**[0:26:12-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:12):**  and all the life cycle analysis and we can go there.  The perennials, we have, for example, one crop, miscanthus gigantus.  I don't know if you've heard, this one bio, new bioenergy cellulosic crop.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  The yield is 50 tons.  Okay.  Naturally.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  So no fertilizer.  It fixes somehow, it just doesn't depend.  So in the amount of roots and rhizobium that it accumulates, it's massive.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:42):**  So that will go.  The problem with miscanthus is that can be an invasive species.  And so DOE, the Department of Energy that has funded the bioenergy centers across the  
**[0:26:55-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:55):**  nations has almost allocated, University of Illinois is looking at miscanthus missing  a state and University of Wisconsin are looking at switchgrass that has much more of a broad  range of possibility of growing.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  But switchgrass on average would accumulate about eight tons of biomass.  So those are the natural behavior to answer your question.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  Big differences in plant.  Wheat is five tons maximum and half of that will be, you know, could be grains.  And so I'm talking about in general average total and the primary productivity of that  
**[0:27:33-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  particular crop.  But I want to spend a minute on saying that people may not realize that nowadays the level  of photosynthesis done through two things, improved genetics and management, basically  
**[0:27:48-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  spoon feeding a crop, we have reached the level of yield of corn of 600 bushels.  So the average national is 170 bushels and world record for the last four or five years  has been in the range of close to 580, 50 and 600 the last one, 615 actually, which  
**[0:28:11-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  when you convert it into total biomass, we're talking about now 50 tons per hectare.  But the amount of that's very positive emitter because of the amount of it doesn't accumulate  carbon per se because of the balances through the amount of inputs that they're used.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  As I initially said, Diego, with agriculture being an anthropogenic component to the climate  is through fertilizer addition, we lose 50 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions coming  from agriculture come from into all emissions.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  And so that's another balance because even the potential of total accumulation of carbon  is still requires nitrogen to go with it.  There is a CN ratio.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  So you will always be depleted by nitrogen unless you add fertilizer.  So if you want to fill all the soils with five percent in the globe, it will be equivalent  to have 75 percent of the fertilizer production that we currently have in the world, which  
**[0:29:19-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  is really, really heavy source of emissions.  Now that doesn't mean that that fertilizer has to come from synthetic fertilizer.  There are legumes that can be produced.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  So if we want to come back to the species, yes, different species have different capacity,  have different photosynthetic capacity and rates of accumulating carbon per unit area.  The amount of this carbon, remember, there is a component above the plant, but there  
**[0:29:48-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:48):**  is also roots.  So there is this root shoot composition that actually in situation where water is not available,  roots become deeper.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  And so basically the plants provide this feedback mechanisms of saying, OK, the roots is, I'm  going to do this.  There is actually a simple way to think if plants is exposed to a stress and the stress  
**[0:30:13-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  comes from above, what would it be a stress coming from above?  Reduced light, right?  You know, shading from then the all the simulates will go to the top and the plants will try  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  and go faster, you know, try to elevate.  If the stress comes from the soil, the soil gets the priority.  The plant, the part of the plants in the soil.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  So if there is a water stress, plants doesn't grow higher, actually says, OK, no problem.  I'm going to invert, shuts down the photosynthetic.  Some of the simulates go down to the roots because remember, it's not photosynthesizing,  
**[0:30:51-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  but the roots are growing because they are desperately in search of water.  And so you get more roots that way.  So this mechanism changes by species.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  But to again, to your question, yes, different species, different capacity.  And I mean, a separation in the beginning depends how they manage.  So if corn is managed with no fertilizer and it lets grow for so many years, it will be  
**[0:31:17-0:31:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  far from getting 600 bushel.  You barely get 100, you know, 100 bushel at the end because you run out of, the corn is  a very highly consumptive crops because of the sizes and it doesn't fix nitrogen on its  
**[0:31:30-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:30):**  own like miscants.  So I actually switched grass pretty well without fertilizer.  So there is that mechanism that complicates even things.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  On fertilizer emissions being a big source of greenhouse gases, are all fertilizers critical?  So if we had chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers, manures or byproducts from the  animal processing industry, do those contribute to greenhouse gases equally?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  No, they don't.  So synthetic fertilizer are immediate emission.  You put them and you have these big flashes of, again, at the Kello biological station,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  we have a series of long term data, the long term ecological research site led by Phil  Robertson for so many years now, Nick, they've been measuring into just basically continuously  right on automatic chambers.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  And so it's very, depends on the amount of water that, you know, after the rain there  is so synthetic fertilizer immediately.  And you may be aware of this is basically about roughly 1% of the fertilizer there is  
**[0:32:44-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  added.  This is a very simple concept.  It's called the mission factor that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has done a very comprehensive  
**[0:32:55-0:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  review of looking at fertilizer rates, comparison and emission.  And so there was a consistent number.  You put 100 pounds, you lose one pound.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:06):**  And the problem is that one kilogram of N2O is 300 kilograms of CO2.  It's 300 times more powerful in the global warming potential, like much rougher in the  atmosphere.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  It traps a lot more, 300 times more powerful.  And so manure, it's an organic form.  Okay, it does not have, plants do not use nitrogen in the organic form.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  They have to be mineralized.  So mineralized first in form of, you know, from N2 to NO3 and then it can be used or  nitrification to NH4, ammonium.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:48):**  So this takes time.  So the release is the decomposition.  It takes time.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:55):**  It doesn't immediately make nitrogen available from an organic compound available to the  plants.  So there is not an immediate loss and that percentage is lower because it builds carbon,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  it retains carbon, nitrogen is trapped more.  The problem with the amendments of organic amendments is you also may have CH4, methane  emission associated to that application, which is about 25 times more powerful than CO2.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  But overall, no, synthetic fertilizer are the ones that they use the most obviously,  and they are the greatest.  But there is a new approach to slow release fertilizer.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  So basically they have shown to, they're still synthetic, the cost is still very high, but  it does reduce N2O emissions because it slowly releases the amount of mineral nitrogen that  could be volatilized.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  And the other aspect of N2O emissions and fertilizer is that has to be in a conditions  that creates denitrification.  So back to N2, you know, in the form, and that occurs when there is a flooding conditions,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  right, when there is lack of oxygen.  And normally when you add organic compounds, that doesn't happen.  You are back on the healthy side of having greater porosity, better conditions in general.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  So synthetic fertilizer are certainly the ones emitting the most.  But it's not even a natural, a cover crop will have emissions, not as high obviously  as a fertilizer, but it's a natural process.  
**[0:35:43-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:43):**  Where would a crop be in terms of net nitrogen loss?  If I planted corn year after year in the same place and I wasn't doing tillage and I had,  let's say, had really good soils, would I need to add nitrogen or could I get that system  
**[0:36:03-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  to function without nitrogen addition if I left all that biomass?  Very good question.  It goes back on the temporal time and on the first year.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  So I, you may have seen in some of my research by scaling and understanding this spatial  variation as identifying that each field as like a farmer will know, but not all the farmers  know that and can be scaled, that there are parts of the field that are much better, you  
**[0:36:33-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  know, because they have deeper soil, like deeper volume.  And so those, then it becomes back to the virtuous cycle where you have greater biomass,  greater roots, greater decompositions, and you do accumulate that.  
**[0:36:50-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  The mineralization, so an organic, fully, let's say, in this way will be an organic  source of management.  If it's managed correctly, it could compensate, but you may not have the same level of yields.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  The yield could have a penalty in the beginning.  In the first years, it may not be sufficiently to compensate what you were used to.  So we also seen at this long-term study that organic systems, and in our case, it was only  
**[0:37:26-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  cover crop and no tillage, it could come close to the yields of the mineralization just because  it isn't just about all nitrogen.  They held more water and the conventional tillage ran out of water much quicker.  
**[0:37:44-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  Okay, so it's really a system.  So to answer your question, immediately, no, long-term, certainly can.  But the yields are not obviously the 600 bushels, but they can easily get to the level of average  
**[0:38:01-0:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  yields, which will bring the benefits of trade-off analysis of the cost of doing things.  Farmers need to understand that, and they do, for sure, not necessarily all of them,  but profit is also obtained by spending less investing.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:21):**  So it's not, unfortunately, nitrogen is a cheap and economic source of insurance as  a thing.  It costs significantly lower to put an extra pound compared to, it's basically 50 cents  
**[0:38:35-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  versus $4 a bushel that you could get from the addition.  And that's again, back onto the trade-offs.  Are we serious about accumulating carbon and using it carbon to store and offset the emissions  
**[0:38:50-0:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  and so on versus the profit?  I'm always of the idea that we need to be able to reward farmers for what they do in  long-term sustainability, basically keep carbon there and using more sustainable management,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:06):**  which is to reduce the amount of fertilizer.  The reduced amount of fertilizer, it's very interesting, back to the space of variation,  there are parts of the fields shouldn't even be cultivated with the same crop, but they  
**[0:39:16-0:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:16):**  are even cultivated with the same management.  So a corn crop that yields 100 bushels either on the edge of the field or on some poor conditions,  that receives 200 pounds per acre on average depending on, let's say, typical.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:34):**  And that's unacceptable because you're really emitting much more.  So converting those areas into more perennial and legumes, then you will build the soil  and the system to be able to mineralize that.  
**[0:39:50-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  Given some of the work you do with SIBO and in just some of the academic work you've done,  it seems like a lot of the focus is on carbon emissions.  But if you have nitrogen oxide, which is worse at the end of the day, shouldn't there also  
**[0:40:06-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  be some concern about containing nitrogen within the system?  And is nitrogen the same as carbon?  If you reach that carbon saturation point in the soil where it's at equilibrium, could  
**[0:40:18-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  nitrogen be the same in a natural system where everything that's being used is being stored  in the soil, either in the biomass or in the living microbial biomass in the soil?  Yes, very good.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  The first question, Diego, that's not necessarily, when we say carbon emissions, everything is  converted into CO2 equivalent.  So everybody knows that the greatest emissions come from N2O.  
**[0:40:51-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  And we aim to reduce N2O emissions, but there are a drag of CO2 equivalent.  So I am working on a way to basically create carbon credits by reducing, but better managing  fertilizer.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  It comes as a benefit to the atmosphere because you reduce the CO2 equivalent from nitrogen.  Nitrogen is critical also because people have talked enough, but it's kind of lost now in  terms of benefits from water quality is a critical aspect of nitrogen.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  The system by definition in soils is a leaking system.  So nitrates, because of the way the molecule has this negative charge, they're basically  very mobile.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  So the point of saturation is really hard to get because you get a flush and it very  goes down to the next layer and so on.  So the nitrogen in general, it's never on a fully positive accumulation because it's  
**[0:41:58-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  used by the plants is denitrify, it's volatilized, but most of it is basically lost as nitrate  reaching.  And in addition, some will be surface runoff, that soil is taken with that.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  But a third or more, so back to the spatial variation in the areas of low nitrogen use  efficiency, these areas will take only 40 to 50% at the most of what it was applied.  So I bring this example often when I talk to growers, it says, imagine you buy this  
**[0:42:37-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  pound, a hundred pound bag, and you dump the first 50 in the parking lot, and then you  go back to your field and you apply.  Why did you apply so much more on these areas?  
**[0:42:49-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  Well, it's just an example.  I don't necessarily know, but now technology would eventually possibly in the end of the  talk, we could go on the future of how data and digital technologies could help.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  But we have a very good knowledge of where these low areas in a field are.  And so you could now have a hundred percent efficiency by putting 50% of the amount because  the yield is basically that plant is small and only requires half of what it was demanding  
**[0:43:21-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  initially.  So again, the point is saturation.  It's like impossible because of an open container.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  It doesn't have a bucket at the end.  Carbon doesn't move, it's tight and it reaches, it's like you can only put so much around  it.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:39):**  Then with nitrates, because of the nature in the leaky system, they're lost as nitrate  reaching.  So that's very difficult to manage just because of that.  
**[0:43:52-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  In addition, you may notice that there's still a tendency for various reasons.  I'm not here to judge, but the majority of the application of fertilizer, it's done at  the end of the season without even knowing what you're going to basically get in the  
**[0:44:09-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  year.  So obviously for reason of logistics, reason of possible lower prices and in the middle  of the summer, you may very well be sure, but they don't necessarily go back.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  And so what do they do?  They kind of compensate with a large amount in the beginning.  That's changing and they're doing all the way to now variable rates of application where  
**[0:44:35-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  one area gets one amount and another gets a different amount.  So there's quite a bit of improvements both in science of understanding the dynamics,  detecting these deficiencies, but there's a combination of a culture of managing maybe  
**[0:44:53-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  more traditionally, but that's very split.  There are lots of progressive farmers.  And so as a suggestion in general, imagine nitrogen to be like your food.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  You don't just stack up and cook a huge amount.  You will be eating it through time.  You won't be eating it all at once.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  So what's the point of cooking 10 steaks when you can only eat one, then the rest is thrown  away because you will be spoiled, right?  That's the equivalent of the leachate.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  And so if you apply the nitrogen when it's needed, which is difficult because synchronizing  supply and demand is a conflict.  Sometimes you cannot go back in the field, but there are times when you can and there  
**[0:45:37-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  is a limit when you can.  There are alternatives with high boys and more describing obviously a Midwest based  in vegetables.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  It's very important to, you know, feed with more of a spoon type of approach than having  all the ones because a fraction of that will be lost through water.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  So even in the healthiest or best managed system, you're going to be needing to add  some because it just is a leaky system.  There are pores.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  There are macro pores and water comes down.  It takes you don't lose it just to give you an idea.  How long will it take for me to lose?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  You know what I put in?  It's usually nitrates are never lost in the season.  They're always lost when the plants are not there to be taken out.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:23):**  So what's good about growing vegetable?  You do have nitrogen that if you have another crop coming in, there is leftovers that can  be used.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  The difficulties, remember because of the nature of leaching, some of these nitrates  are not in the surface.  They're now a little bit deeper, quite a bit deeper.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:46):**  Now they are on the second foot of soil.  So you could prevent some of it when you know deeper roots.  So again, the leaching could be up to 50%, but you know, high yielding crop can be as  
**[0:46:59-0:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  low as 15%.  What about in crop rotation?  So you know, we've talked to cover crops legumes.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:07):**  A legume when it's out of the field, that nitrogen that it's accumulated in its body,  it's in roots, that's not going to be instantly available.  Do you get a slower, I'll say leaching into the soil as those, that biomass breaks down  
**[0:47:25-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  or do you experience that flush like you do with a chemical fertilizer where eventually  it's all going to come loose?  No, it's the first aspect you introduced.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  The cover crops and legumes that they are either left on the surface or put in the beginning,  I mean the top layers, few inches, takes time to decompose.  They need to have the decomposition time.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  There is never a flush under a green manure, sorts of things versus the fertilizer.  Why do we have fertilizer in the first place?  Because they provide food when you need it.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  The nitrates are already in the form.  Those legumes don't have, they're still organic.  They don't have nitrates immediately.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  They still have to get out of the organic compounds that they are tied in to be able  to be.  So you have to go through that process, which is a tricky business because it takes time  
**[0:48:28-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  and you release, you have to have a plant using it.  I've done a study just to compare that sometimes excessive amount of manures don't get you  off the hook.  
**[0:48:39-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  They will still lose nitrates because in the off season when plants continue to mineralize,  then there are no crops to be taken up and it will still lose.  So it's again, this lag of time of decomposition that allows the reduction in flushes of nitrates  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  going down.  Fertilizer in comparison, you can have 60 to 100 parts per million, very huge, 10% is  allowed.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  Okay, immediately.  When do we see that now?  When we collect water in lysimeters, April, May in the environment that I'm used to in  
**[0:49:21-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:21):**  the Midwest, the soil has been fully saturated with water over winter.  You grew up in East Coast, so there is, you know, the amount of was plenty of snow, the  soil closed.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  Guess what?  First sampling we get in the beginning of, you know, when the soil is done, very much  a large component, large nitrates.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  And then the ones that is used, that is used efficiently during the season, then the plants  basically it's like eating when they need it and sneaking only lower is basically lost  to that.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  But a green manure is much more sustainable way of applying nitrogen in a form, but there  is a price of the land of not being available.  So this is really the reasoning behind one of those NRCS principles of always keep a  
**[0:50:15-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  living root in the soil as long as possible is obviously it's feeding the soil through  root exudates, but it's also soaking up any nitrogen that might otherwise be lost.  Like you'd never want that soil sitting there.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  So in a leaky system with a leaky molecule, you always want something they're trying to  catch it so it doesn't have the chance to squeeze away.  Spot on.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  Soils wants company, soil is designed to have plants, plants use what is produced by the  soil and that's exactly the way you should be managed.  I'm pushing Ego for some concept that farmers should be rewarded for the numbers of green  
**[0:50:55-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:55):**  surface they have over their soil.  You know, some obviously you will say, well, the Midwest, you know, big chunk of time is  white.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  You know, the cover crop underneath, you know, that food that's considered basically living  organisms.  And so rotation, we initially meant that, you know, touched upon the possibility of  
**[0:51:16-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  having such a beautiful diversity of individuals or microbes.  And that's extremely, extremely important to be able to have that.  Can you elaborate on that on a temperate climate standpoint?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  I mean, obviously we don't have that problem here in California, but in areas where you  get winter, where you get snow, I think a lot of people take it for granted.  Well, the ground's frozen, the snow's covering it.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  I don't need a living cover.  What cover crops would be beneficial to have in the ground under that snow cap and why  is that beneficial and how does that play out over the season from the fall through  
**[0:51:58-0:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  the freeze to the thaw?  Very good.  I'm hoping we will get there because if you know this so far, we have not mentioned one  
**[0:52:07-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:07):**  word of a possibility of continuing to degrade the land, which is erosion, soil erosion.  So if you retain the residues and you have those roots as the cement that they keep the  particle, doesn't matter.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  You got snow, the snow blows, but not everything else.  Right?  So the first benefit of keeping the soil green in terms of having the cover is to protect  
**[0:52:35-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  from rain erosion and wind erosion.  Okay.  Second, remember that wheat, winter wheat resists to a temperature of minus 17 Celsius.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  That's roughly minus 30 Fahrenheit or so.  Okay.  That's that.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  So when the snow keeps it at a microclimate close to zero, the plant kind of goes dormant  for a little bit, but when the snow and some places, especially now in these more recent  years, the soil is not fully covered by the snow all the time.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  There is a melting.  And so there is basically life coming back to me and you know, very, very slow situation,  but the first immediate benefit is keeping the soil cover and protecting from erosion.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:25):**  The next thing is as soon as life comes back in the early spring, then the plant is already  there.  The roots are there.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  They're ready to go.  Why?  It gets warmer and they have water.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  So the next thing, if you're interested in seeing the plant growing, it'll grow fast,  because of the initial warming temperature and the possibility of using that water, you  know, right there to be able to allow that to.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:56):**  Now what's interesting is because of this situation of, if you're not able to put a  cover crop at the right time, why would you not be able to do that?  Soil is still wet.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  You know, it's just, you really could be in the fall.  You have a seed amount.  So one more recent is called interseeding.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  Okay.  So interseeding at D3, D6 when the common plant has three colored leaves.  So it's about this tall.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:28):**  You can basically plant the cover crop.  We showed there is two studies that I actually recently published here with a project with  a colleague of mine, Karen Renner.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  Can cover crops be able to not compete?  Basically doesn't affect, because corn has already gone in its own way.  Why would not?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  Because it starts covering them.  But they're alive.  They get some light coming through.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  And so when you harvest, you have a beautiful green crop that stays over winter and stays  basically.  You reduce the patchiness when you go in winter because of the variability in soil water and  
**[0:55:13-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  soil profile and temperature and texture.  What I mean by patchiness, one area is very well established and another area wouldn't  come out.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  But if it's planted at a proper time during interseeding, then you will have a better  stand, a better possibility of getting that.  So that's an improvement on having interseeding, which benefits back to the possibility of  
**[0:55:38-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:38):**  having this diversity of roots.  You have to be in a very dry condition, obviously.  If you talk about having cover crops or interseeding more in a Mediterranean climate, then it's  
**[0:55:49-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  not a popular thing to do because they would use water.  So it depends.  California is very similar in a way.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  But if it is done with the concept of possibility of building carbon retaining water, even the  rainfall that occurs, it allows better infiltration and less runoff because the intensity of the  rain, it's reduced.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:14):**  Imagine heavy rain hitting the soil with nothing on it and heavy rain hitting the leaves.  And then slowly the droplets come in and you have a significant reduced runoff if you have  a cover on your soil.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:28):**  And so that's another benefit.  This means, I'm usually with my students, we write diagrams and we see my message here  is there is one size fits all.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  But I heard that this, that, this, it's just never be, you have to be surprised all the  time how things, yes, it's one way, but there is this other component that pulls you back.  So it's a system.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  It really is.  It's a system of feedback and dynamics that everything that I pretty much talked about  with you.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  And I really compliment you with such a deep knowledge of putting the system together yourself  to understand what, how basically the soil plant atmosphere behaves across different  spaces and conditions.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  Yeah.  And I appreciate that.  And I think that's really good context for people to think about in this case.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  One big thing you see a lot now in the veg world is interplanting multiple crops planted  in the same space.  One negative to that, I mean, well, you mentioned if water's scarce, that's obviously one.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  If it affects harvesting, that can be a problem.  But let's say those aren't problems.  Do you think you get yield sacrifices or do you get a equal or potentially better yield  
**[0:57:50-0:58:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  out of both crops given that they're more crops and less space, they're sharing water,  they're sharing nutrients?  So again, you said the right thing.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:01):**  It depends on the context.  If we go in southern Spain or southern Italy and again, southern California, where you  wish to have additional water naturally, then every drop is critical and should be prioritized  
**[0:58:18-0:58:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  to what you basically trying to.  But if you have a possibility to irrigate and you build now, I see the same thing as  before.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:27):**  You're building a system that would build carbon and will retain the positivity of building  the, holding more water.  And so in that case, you would be, it would be beneficial for everything that we just  
**[0:58:43-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  said.  In the case of, you know, lack of rainfall, then the soil needs to be covered with some  other ways, whether it's mulch or residues, because you want to prevent soil evaporation.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  Okay.  So when you see the world of ET in valve for transpiration, it's like the blanket.  If whatever you don't lose from soil evaporation, our goal is to basically have water go through  
**[0:59:11-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  the plant as maximizing transpiration, maximizing the water use through, because with the water  you take, basically you keep the turgor in the cell, you take the nutrients and you taking  water away from soil evaporation.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:28):**  And so that's a balance that in the model that I developed, that that's balanced between  the soil surface wetness.  You know, wetness, meaning if it is wet on the surface, transpiration is reduced.  
**[0:59:44-1:00:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  There is a microclimate, you know, compared then if the soil is dry, because if the soil  is dry, it creates a sensible heat, like, you know, feeling really hot and additional  feedback to water stress to the plant.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:00):**  So that benefit of having another plant, I can't argue against not having water and having  another plant is like not necessarily the way you want to do it.  If you depend on rainfall, that doesn't come.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  But again, keeping the soil covered, it will benefit.  In areas where you manage it, you do want to have, because of the benefits of the microbial  and the biology, not to underestimate.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  And on the long term effects of remember, retaining those residues, remember that you  are in debt from your saturation.  And as much you can bring that, the more you bring that, think of that, and when you increase  
**[1:00:40-1:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:40):**  carbon, you have another equivalent bucket, you increase water.  So see it that way.  The more carbon, the more stability you will increase the yield facing difficult conditions.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:53):**  In terms of, you know, dipping into that carbon jar and using up some of that carbon, no-till  is talked about as a way to stop that and slow that down.  But no-till is kind of this umbrella, it's a sliding scale in terms of what that is.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  And some people, you know, they get really nuanced in terms of, you know, literally nothing  to some people, you know, vertical tillage might count as no-till.  Where does tillage become a problem?  
**[1:01:23-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:23):**  Is it depth?  Is it a certain amount?  Where if we are in a human system, right?  
**[1:01:28-1:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  Like we need a certain amount of production, we have to manage these things.  Certain things can't happen using kind of idealistic systems.  Is there an amount of tillage that's kind of within that no-till regime that is probably  
**[1:01:45-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:45):**  okay, but if you start really going beyond that, that's when major damage starts to happen?  Yes, very good point.  One just one thing that I like the audience to listen and to understand, you use the word  
**[1:01:58-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  we use carbon.  It's more we lose carbon, you know, because plants don't use it, carbon from the soil.  We lose it in terms of basically CO2 as a mechanism of respiration.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  We accumulate carbon in the soil by bringing it in, and we lose it from CO2 emitted.  So roots don't use carbon, they put carbon into the soil.  And the microbes eat on that.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:24):**  And at some point, if we still have time, it's important to explain the level of the  different components of carbon.  You know, how, why is it different, you know, the sugar, the lignin and cellulose and so  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  on.  Cellulose.  So yes, the tillage is tricky.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:41):**  There is a mechanism that should be avoided, which what we call inversion tillage, flipping  the whole layer, moldboard plow.  The old plowing.  
**[1:02:55-1:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:55):**  What does plowing do?  Plowing effective effects basically creates a tillage pan.  Basically I cost the patient like a restricting layer by pushing and you will have this to  
**[1:03:11-1:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:11):**  have a much lower conductivity of water.  So the layer is much more compacted.  Okay, so this clay pan or tillage pan, and then you flip it.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:23):**  What do you bring in the most active?  Getting living large and accumulating.  You bring it upside down, you put it to the oxygen.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:31):**  So gets basically immediately lost everything that you had.  So tillage unfortunately has this difficult thing, which again, we cannot judge.  It depends on the goal.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  It's almost, you know, objective function is, but I mean, okay, how are you going to  grow a potato if you don't till?  Right.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:52):**  And we like potatoes.  Yeah, of course we like potatoes.  So can we mitigate that component of doing that?  
**[1:03:57-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:57):**  Why do we grow, where do we grow potatoes?  We tend to grow potatoes in sandy soils where there is much less structure to start with.  So one thing about me is that I'm not, I'm above the parts in describing this system.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  So no one can be offended if I say, no tillage, you do one tillage, you lose pretty much a  lot of what you have already accumulated because you just play.  When you do the surface, and like you said, you know, you scrape the surface, you do a  
**[1:04:24-1:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  little bit of that.  If it is non-inversion tillage, it is sometimes necessary, for example, in all the organic  system where you basically pull the weeds.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:35):**  Is that, there are so many studies comparing, is that scraping the surface to remove that  weed and the weed being on the soil that brings carbon better than spraying it with an herbicide  that costs you an arm and a leg in carbon and energy to spray it where you do no tillage.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  And so a full no tillage is the ideal situation where basically rotations, you can still do  no tillage in controlling the weeds by having cover crops, you know, and, but there are,  there are difficulties, you still have to dry them down, you know, you have to kill  
**[1:05:12-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  them and so you use chemical herbicide and you're ready to a level of complexity that  you don't belong already into a certified, you know, kind of organic system.  So back to your question, if you scrape that, what do you, what are you basically doing?  
**[1:05:27-1:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  You are losing that carbon you accumulated, but only from that layer.  You haven't touched this part.  The part below that remains, the aggregate remains the same.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  So when you touch it, you touch it, it's open.  You break the aggregates and carbon is emitted as a CO2 because the microbes can access the  carbon available and it's a feast.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:52):**  If it is protected inside, they stay in there, they don't leave, they eat and poop, you know,  and expel carbon in the aggregate and the aggregates are much closer.  So that glue keeps growing and becomes, if you scrape that, fires enemies, you want to  
**[1:06:08-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:08):**  get rid of weeds, then the damage is for those.  You lose, you change bulk density, you change that percent of carbon and we can quantify  exactly how much carbon you have emitted in the atmosphere versus flipping the whole marble  
**[1:06:21-1:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  plough, you know, you mix the hell out of that and then you lose a large amount.  But again, are you, you know, potatoes have to be done this way, but there are lots of  other novel techniques of be able to managing potatoes in a way that could accumulate more  
**[1:06:40-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:40):**  carbon.  Yeah, it's a longer rotation where your potatoes and then your cover crops for a few years  build that carbon back up and then...  
**[1:06:48-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  Exactly, and you maintain, that's exactly right.  No potatoes after potatoes, so you go back to your, you can have your hairy vetch and  clover as cover crop right away.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:58):**  You have corn and soybeans and you bring back to the system what you did.  Then because, because we have to eat potatoes, there's no question on their bounties and  the value and fibers and all the positive aspects of that.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  Well let's look at what you were talking about previously, you know, different forms of carbon.  So people listening to this, they think of carbon in the soil, you have a few things.  You have a living root, you have the exudates coming out of that root, you have the microbes  
**[1:07:26-1:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:26):**  in the soil that have carbon in their bodies, and then you have previous plant material  that's left in the soil.  So all these different forms of carbon.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:36):**  When you talk about that, how do you explain this to people and how do you value these  in the system?  Yes, so I try to keep simple because it's a complex matter and you have to start separating  
**[1:07:51-1:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  what we call as organic matter.  One is fresh organic matter and one is soil organic matter.  When you say the fresh is in the soil, yes, but it's a fresh organic matter are the roots,  
**[1:08:04-1:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04):**  all the residues, so more plant-based related.  Manure, fresh organic, you know, you put it from fresh that is quickly decomposed.  Now that fresh organic matter has different pools and these pools are just like, what  
**[1:08:20-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:20):**  would you think?  I mean, I don't know about, if I can think of a good example, but if you were to eat  something and you know it wouldn't be bad for you, most of us probably would choose  
**[1:08:30-1:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  dessert to eat first.  Because so there is the first thing that the microbeats are sugar.  So they eat the sugars, the carbohydrates, and that's very labile, really quick to decompose.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:42):**  They eat it, poop, expel.  Then they go on the chewy stuff, the fiber, like weed, you know, like more of it.  And that's the cellulose and amicellulose, the component of, you know, people are more  
**[1:08:55-1:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:55):**  familiar with those concepts in the trees and the park and so on.  Then lignin, much harder and chewy, and that's still the roots.  And so a leaf, how long does it take for a leaf in the fall to decompose?  
**[1:09:09-1:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:09):**  I mean, you look at it, it's gone just about, you know, a few months because it's, how much  lignin does it have?  Very little compared, it's much more soft and versus, you know, a piece of wood that  
**[1:09:20-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:20):**  has a deceiving amount of, you know, lignin.  And the fresh organic matter, so it's the first thing and the things that those microbes,  they become the organic carbon and the organic carbon has three different pools.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  We call it pools again as a qualitative description.  A labile pool, very quick turnaround, less than six months to a year.  It depends really on the type of where the soil is and climate and everything, but very  
**[1:09:53-1:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  short dynamics.  Then you have the intermediate or slow pool, that's what we wish to have the most.  The eumic form, things that stays and becomes that colloidal material, black looking stuff,  
**[1:10:09-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:09):**  the good soil organic carbon.  Biochar for example, stays, it's a lot of all the other stuff is gone, you maintain  it in the soil.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  Very good amendment.  But biochar is almost also towards more resistant.  Then you've got a resistant or passive as you want to call, those are the ones that  
**[1:10:28-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:28):**  we use for carbon dating.  You know, you can go back to the Romans time and you know where that stone is because there's  carbon that will last for so long.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  But normally those are in the century old type of dynamics to decompose that.  Each of them, every time it decomposes, releases CO2, it goes into the atmosphere.  So the first component, 16% of the first pool immediately when decomposed, CO2.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:57):**  Organic matter from this labile, some of it is accumulated and goes into the slow pool.  That one gets decomposes much slower over a longer period of time, goes to CO2 and each  of them.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  So it's basically this, if you imagine almost this six kind of circle, three above fresh  organic matter, you know, labile, the carbohydrates, amicelulose, cellulose, lignin, labile pool,  intermediate pool, humus, slope and resistance.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:31):**  For somebody, you know, if we want that intermediate pool, how do you get that into the soil?  How do you build that up?  If you wanted to turn that number up in your soil, what are ways somebody would do that?  
**[1:11:42-1:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:42):**  You add carbon, you add residues, you add roots.  It cannot be produced by itself.  It has to come from outside.  
**[1:11:51-1:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:51):**  It has to come from living organisms.  It comes from fresh.  Oh, those three pools above are connected to the one below.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:57):**  Those are the ones that funnel into that.  So how do you accumulate that?  By putting mulch, by putting manure, by putting.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:05):**  So organic matter per se, like I said, is 60% carbon.  So it's, but that gets burned quickly because it's the fresh organic matter.  So a big chunk of that is lost.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  But one thing is when you do a soil sampling and you get a big large number in a mineral  soils, you have got a piece of fresh organic matter somehow.  Something is not, you know, it cannot be a 12, 13% organic matter converted into 6 or  
**[1:12:39-1:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:39):**  7% organic carbon in a very short time, knowing what your equilibrium is and where you are  in the rotation if you are in a grazing system.  So there is that, it doesn't mean that, oh, I didn't see anything or there was a business  
**[1:12:53-1:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:53):**  there.  It's very, you know, fine decomposition, but that will eventually be lost.  That's what I'm saying.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:00):**  It looks there, but it's going to be lost.  One that stays is the organic carbon.  And if you look at the literature and the sampling over time for all this, when you  
**[1:13:09-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  analyze for organic carbon, it changes very little.  It could change a lot if you add, basically add more carbon in the form of fresh organic  matter roots.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  So that fresh organic matter under the soil, microbes start to eat it and that's how it  ends up in that intermediate pool.  Eventually it's in those bodies of those organisms.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:33):**  Some is emitted, you can prevent that.  Some is lost as part of the decomposition.  So roughly three tons of in a maize system, you know, you return five, it is not yield.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  You could return five tons, 3.5 tons of lost for CO2, un-preventable, but you have accumulated  one ton.  Then the next year, don't touch, you keep doing good yield.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:56):**  You keep bringing that.  That's another ton.  That's so, but when you had the ton out of a volume, if you want to calculate the stock,  
**[1:14:06-1:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:06):**  Diego is you have an organic percent, which is whatever number you have, the depth that  you're using and you have bulk density.  What's the density of the soil, you know, the weight of the soils over the volume.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:20):**  And so when you multiply the percent carbon with the bulk density, you have the volume  of the soil percent of that.  So an example, I mean, just by doing it in my mind, there are roughly, you know, 25,000  
**[1:14:34-1:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  kilograms in 1.3% bulk density for 15 centimeters.  And that's basically the stock.  So you add one ton, 24 is 0.1%.  
**[1:14:46-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:46):**  There's very little increase, but it's going up.  But as soon as you open that jar, it's no longer three of the decomposition becomes  four or five because you're adding these layers that you slowly open by mixing that soil with  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  the tillage.  We covered a lot of ground.  I hope it was clear, but...  
**[1:15:06-1:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:06):**  No, no, it's good.  And that's even got me thinking.  I mean, is above ground and below ground decomposition of carbon equal?  
**[1:15:15-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:15):**  So above ground, like the dry biomass, most of that just goes away into the sky when it  breaks down.  When you go underground, if you look at the dry biomass of the roots, does that break  
**[1:15:27-1:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  down and volatilize as much as above ground?  Because what I'm getting at, would you rather be putting 100 units on soil surface or 100  units below soil surface if you want to keep as much carbon in the soil?  
**[1:15:42-1:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:42):**  Very, very good question.  If you put it on the surface, it won't decompose as fast.  So that carbon stays there.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:52):**  It can be blown out, you know, with wind and everything.  But if it stays, Argentina is a perfect example.  You go to a field in Argentina and you are walking on a mattress of residues.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:06):**  You don't see the soil.  I mean, there's this much amount of beautiful, small, finely broken soybean and corn stalks  residues.  
**[1:16:18-1:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:18):**  That's the true carbon that we are not putting in the atmosphere.  That stays there for a long time.  What happens eventually if you don't want it to be lost, if it's lost, it just goes  
**[1:16:28-1:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:28):**  to another place.  So to answer your question, you very, very correctly pointed out what happens if you  put it in the soil.  
**[1:16:36-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:36):**  You bring the organic matter in the soil higher, you add in carbon, but there is a fraction  of that that's lost to CO2.  So it's a balance.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  If you keep it on the surface, it doesn't get decomposed.  That's pure carbon.  40 to 50 percent roughly of that amount of biomass is carbon stored there.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  You put it in there, 60 percent of that goes to CO2.  So 40 percent stays.  In the soil.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  In the soil.  Yeah.  So but up there it's nearly 100 percent because there are no microbes.  
**[1:17:13-1:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  Slowly, yeah, microbes will.  So there is normally this is actually even we do it in the model that that top mulch  works its way through and that's why the top soil always has higher organic matter and  
**[1:17:32-1:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  this residue never really reach much deeper except for the rooting system that over time  if they are well grown and established you can have root system in corn going down three  feet, four feet down.  
**[1:17:50-1:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:50):**  Alpha is nearly five meters.  And so that I don't know if that explains.  So if you leave it there.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:59):**  No, it does.  But on that thick mat, like one thing I always think is like when you put roots in the soil,  you're building soil down, like because the roots are pushing down where you can't go.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:09):**  If you're if you're putting organic matter on top as a mulch, you're building soil up  because eventually that mulch layer like the soil level rises up.  Correct?  
**[1:18:17-1:18:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17):**  Yeah.  You building soils, you build.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:20):**  You're making a step that is free over time that you slowly it takes very little to lose  soil and it takes hundreds of years to build soils.  How do you build soils?  
**[1:18:32-1:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:32):**  With exactly the way you said you're basically building this that eventually this you steam  things decompose, you put a seed that will grow, right?  That's new sorts of because then it gets mixed in and it slowly improves.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:45):**  If you put it there, it's not that you never want to put it in there because roots are  there and you want to keep them there and so on.  But some gets decomposed.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  Now it's a rate, it's a balance, how fast you put it out versus how fast you draw your  bank account.  So the roots get decomposed.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:05):**  When you next year you put more residues and the roots and the yield is getting bigger,  those three times when you put four you accumulated one.  So the prevention, the CO2 is un-preventable.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  It's this part of the decomposition.  Now but there are thresholds, there's complexities, not always if it is cold, what happens?  Nothing happens.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:31):**  Means the soils carbon stays like that.  Stays like the surface.  If it is too wet also it can kind of becomes you know it gets denit, de-95 but there is  
**[1:19:45-1:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:45):**  conditions no good.  Next example I can do, tropical soils, desert, how much carbon is in those soils?  Man they got rain, they got plenty of vegetation, right?  
**[1:19:56-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:56):**  In tropic conditions.  Why there's no carbon?  There's no carbon, 0.5, 1% less.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  Acting expedite because of the temperature.  So the temperature plays a big role and soil water content plays a big role.  And there is an optimum of mineralization, of decompositions of this.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  So cold conditions, the prairie, the midwest and Illinois soils of you know four or five  percent, three, four percent because they were at 5.5 and they lost it once they tilled.  So cold is good, keeps, preserves you, everything is good.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:40):**  Hot turns things down.  And so that's also with water content.  And so we have functions.  
**[1:20:47-1:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:47):**  Another thing is percent of clay.  Percent of clay, clay plays a protection factor.  So basically the biogeochemistry, carbon is tied to and it's much more difficult to decompose  
**[1:21:03-1:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:03):**  on a clay particle.  Sandy soils, how much carbon is in sandy soils?  Significantly lower than clay because in clay it's protected.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:12):**  They've done soil biology 101, maybe 201.  It's good.  And one thing you mentioned a little while back is one of those intermediate forms of  
**[1:21:22-1:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:22):**  carbon biochar.  I've talked to people on the podcast about it.  What are your thoughts of it?  
**[1:21:28-1:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:28):**  The theory, you have a chunk of pure carbon, you put it in the soil, it stays there and  it stays there for a very long period of time.  While it may not be greatly beneficial to the soil, at least it's not going up into  
**[1:21:42-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:42):**  the sky.  How do you view it?  I view it positively in terms of it is carbon.  
**[1:21:49-1:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  It stays there for a hundred years.  Terra, Negra in Brazil, these basically beautiful black pieces that you may have already heard  about, the results of the pyrolysis and slow temperature.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:03):**  So it's a good carbon.  The cost benefit is not my analysis to do, but it's equivalent to say, okay, I'm getting  a lot of free carbon that stays in the soil and it's going to build.  
**[1:22:20-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  Does it pay immediately?  Not immediately.  That's a buildup that you do over time, that you basically prime the system to have this  
**[1:22:30-1:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:30):**  carbon.  So it's more of an economic evaluation because there are other forms of possible amendments  that you can add.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:39):**  Now, and again, the goal is not to go in the economic analysis, but it is carbon, it is  positive and stays there for a long time and does improve.  The literature is divided.  
**[1:22:50-1:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  I mean, in terms of saying, because it's there, I think, don't want to judge, but they were  seeing, oh, one study, so yield effect increase, another study decline.  You can't translate it like that.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:03):**  It depends where they were down and how the weather occur.  It wasn't, even if you isolate everything, sometimes studies forget about the dynamics  of, you know, consecutive days that was harder versus another.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:15):**  So it's much more complex and most of these studies were maybe not taken as a system approach  of integrating all.  So that's really difficult to detangle the immediate impact on that.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:27):**  I see it as a more, again, just to bring in what are we adding?  We're adding carbon.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:35):**  And how do you see that playing into the future of carbon credit markets where, you know,  you can take scrap wood, brush, tree trimmings.  You could grow trees in a way where you pollard them or coppice them off and burn that off.  
**[1:23:49-1:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:49):**  And then you take what could otherwise sit on the surface in a road or decompose and  you can stabilize that and put it underground.  Is that a potential avenue for offsetting carbon emissions in the future, you know,  
**[1:24:07-1:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:07):**  with you looking at a lot of carbon modeling?  Yes.  So that's a very good question.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:14):**  The carbon sequestration, we call it enough, that is critical.  And I think farmers need to be rewarded for doing the right thing of keeping carbon in  the soil.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24):**  Now is it, it's very difficult to measure carbon in terms of not the measurement, even  though, I mean, partially the measurement per se, because some laboratory, we have actually  having fun doing comparison of laboratory tests and getting different results from the  
**[1:24:40-1:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:40):**  same soil samples, which, so the level of uncertainty is in a value when you get is  pretty large, just from the laboratory, where you sample in one place in the field versus  another.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:54):**  So my take on this thing is that, okay, you take a piece of wood and you put it in the  soil and you think you have added carbon for what we have talked about it.  That thing, yes, it is carbon, but it takes forever to decompose because it's really,  
**[1:25:08-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:08):**  you know, just not chewable and it's not immediate to see this, what we call more of a real organic  carbon.  So the modeling components goes hand to hand to some of the measurements in two ways.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  First of all, there is a role in remote sensing to be able to identify areas of variations  where you could target some of your samples.  But I actually believe that the approach, for example, that SIBO has taken in creating  
**[1:25:38-1:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:38):**  what we call regenerative potentials.  So we know well how a crop grows pretty well.  I mean, to the level of maybe less than five to 10%.  
**[1:25:51-1:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:51):**  And if you're interested, I'll tell you some of the story about the modeling, but five  to 10% accuracy in getting that crop.  And once you have, that's not even a level of error, that crop is returned and it's returned  
**[1:26:05-1:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:05):**  every single year.  It's much more, it's sufficiently safe to use a model with the conditions of what was  done in terms of a farmer reporting, I have been doing these practices.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:21):**  I have not been till, I start from these conditions of this stall type, which it's pretty well  known, and I've grown hairy vetch or rye, or we will know under those conditions because  that's known both statistically, observation and modeling.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:39):**  You say, okay, in this environment is roughly three tons, then some is lost.  So there is a pretty well mass balance of what is returned.  And so my hope is really to be able to get the market of carbon, not just the carbon,  
**[1:26:57-1:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:57):**  but include nitrogen.  The abatement from nitrogen is critical because if you're doing so much more on your land  by reducing the emissions in managing nitrogen better, that needs to be part of that regenerative  
**[1:27:11-1:27:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:11):**  potential altogether, but it has to be paid year on, every single year.  There are other approaches where, okay, it says, okay, you subscribe, we'll see you in  five years, on 10 years.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:24):**  That's nearly impossible for a farmer to stick to some of the promises or not be able to  take the risk of doing things.  They're beneficial and they need to be.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  So that's why I'm working with some of the agency to be able to reward them independently,  just by doing the right thing.  And that's something that hopefully will soon be more considered, including again, one example  
**[1:27:51-1:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:51):**  that I made earlier, removing these unproductive land and be able to have more perennials and  a continuous back to the prairies, continue to have this mass balance of carbon accumulating  from the atmosphere into the soils and the roots and be rewarded because they've taken  
**[1:28:08-1:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:08):**  some of the land off from production.  So the year on versus 10 years where with the dynamics, the change could be small, the  credits that you accumulate over 10 years of time, it needs to be more on year on because  
**[1:28:26-1:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:26):**  you keep the farmer interested and becomes almost a new way of farming, a carbon farming.  You basically are realizing because now is not very high cost.  Now I think in cap and trade, California is about $15.75 and then $16 a ton.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  Companies have spoken and big companies saying, oh, we're willing to pay $60 a ton, $100 a  ton.  $100 a ton when you can accumulate one ton already and you have $100 per acre right there,  
**[1:28:58-1:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:58):**  they don't make a debt now.  They're on a very thin margin, especially the more row crop, corn soybeans and they're  protected by insurance.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:08):**  Sometimes insurance is given for wrong reasons in terms of some of these areas.  Again, it could be a mechanisms of converting the same amount of money to do the right thing  of bringing carbon.  
**[1:29:20-1:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:20):**  So what I'm saying is carbon farming is the new way and digital agriculture could help  that in terms of accumulating data, using models.  That's why obviously I'm biased because I co-founded, you know, Civo Technologies, but  
**[1:29:34-1:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:34):**  the approach of being scalable and identifying the regenerative potential of the soil, this  soil versus another soil, it's on a year on, is much more, you know, beneficial to envision  this more carbon farming than the very slow kind of sampling after 10 years because farmers  
**[1:29:56-1:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:56):**  will just not play that game.  And if you look ahead 10 years, do you think you see a landscape, no pun intended, where  farmers have a cash crop, maybe that's corn and soy, maybe that's cattle, maybe that's  
**[1:30:11-1:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:11):**  vegetables and they also have a carbon crop where they're selling off those credits on  a year to year basis?  You took words out of my mouth.  
**[1:30:20-1:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:20):**  I would exactly say a much more diverse type of cultivation and management of their land,  including, like I said, more biodiversity, pollinators, bringing the butterfly back and  all the benefits in one section that is poor, the veggie in another area and possibly cut  
**[1:30:42-1:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:42):**  the middleman and do more, the new Amazon of going around and collecting, just things  that suddenly this more diverse and the carbon farming will be one.  In addition, I see a change in generation, you go with farmers reaching an age, you know,  
**[1:31:02-1:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:02):**  60, 65, on average, new kids coming very much into technology, you know, they use, they  attracted to some of the research that I do, flying drones and robotics could play, you  know, could be easily envisioned electric robots, you could easily envision a biodegious  
**[1:31:24-1:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:24):**  state, you know, this can be energy on your farm to drive some of this.  There is all that, that's through all this carbon support in some way, but we have a  long way, hopefully it's an exponential curve that goes, you know, faster and, but I am  
**[1:31:45-1:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:45):**  certainly optimistic, but, and I work towards that, I work on the side of the farmer when  they do the right thing, don't oppose when they don't do the right thing, because it's  very important to connect agriculture as a solution, be satisfied with consumers, they  
**[1:32:05-1:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:05):**  are demanding, they want more transparency, but they also need to be able to pay more  and no one wants to do that.  So there is always this complexity of trade off, no one wants to obviously hear about,  
**[1:32:17-1:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:17):**  you know, taxes on carbon, because it's more of a natural, but somehow whether it's taxes  or policy on incentives, they basically, it will be the new way for sure, where things,  it will be another layer of financial incomes, in addition to the quality of the products  
**[1:32:35-1:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:35):**  and new technology by verification, you know, blockchain or other systems to quickly verify  what goes on and very quick way of selling carbon on the internet, when you can swipe  your car, I always upset my mission if I flew to a place and you know, $10 it was trees,  
**[1:32:55-1:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:55):**  now it can be soil carbon.  And that's very much doable because what do you do?  You improve the quality of agriculture, you improve the food, not just, you know, planting  
**[1:33:05-1:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:05):**  out in the United States with all the respect, which is a very, the proper way to do it also.  Yeah.  Hey, if you wanted to sequester the most carbon, if you could, like say that was just, that  
**[1:33:19-1:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:19):**  was your goal, you got 1000 acres, you want to sequester as much carbon as you can using  agricultural practices on that 1000 acres, what would be your approach?  That's a very good question because you didn't give me a timeframe, right?  
**[1:33:34-1:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:34):**  And that's the difficult thing is, so first of all, chemical uses just already makes you  go on a negative side.  But that's the difficulty.  
**[1:33:44-1:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44):**  So I don't necessarily have an immediate answer.  I would use the vegetation that is undisturbed to build if you want to do true carbon, that  will be something that would allow to sequester, that we already talked about, rotation, no  
**[1:34:01-1:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:01):**  tillage, cover crops, you know, keeping the soil green immediately.  That's talking by keywords.  Those are the four immediate things.  
**[1:34:12-1:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:12):**  You want to sequester carbon in terms of that, you can use a lot of the land for solar.  That's still kind of carbon.  If you see carbon as a offset to the emissions, that's an additional thing.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:27):**  The diversification, diversifying crops, meaning, and I grew up in an area in Italy where there  were four crops at the same time.  Four crops growing, how would that be?  
**[1:34:39-1:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:39):**  Different height, different spatial.  So that's a way of basically doing that.  There were veggie, there were grapes, there were olives, there were pecans, you know,  
**[1:34:48-1:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:48):**  like walnuts or in a very rich soil of organic carbon continuously keeping residues going.  So would that be the fast way?  Certainly it would be the way of bringing soil health back into the picture.  
**[1:35:03-1:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:03):**  But in comparison it has to be done.  And the difficulties, you want to increase yield and you say, how can you stabilize it?  It will take longer because you've got to be remembered.  
**[1:35:12-1:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:12):**  One part of the conversation we had, you have to allow these organic carbon to be decomposed  to release nutrients.  And so fertilizer would give you the boost, but they already pulled you down.  
**[1:35:24-1:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:24):**  It's running with, you know, driving with your brain kind of cools because you already  pulled you down by the emissions of N2O.  So in a perfect world, if you had two plants that were equal, is it fair to say the one  
**[1:35:37-1:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:37):**  that produces more root biomass is sequestering more carbon?  Indeed.  So do you see a day where maybe somebody like a Corteva goes out there and they are engineering  
**[1:35:47-1:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:47):**  and breeding out plants like, so you have your corn plant that's already high yielding,  but now we're going to breed that thing to put on as much root mass as possible?  In one of the papers that actually I am writing with colleagues, we have identified, you know,  
**[1:36:01-1:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:01):**  venues of improving basically the future of becoming, let's put this, that we haven't  introduced it, a more circular system.  You know, circularity, there is a trend, was a few years ago, it's coming back, you know,  
**[1:36:15-1:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:15):**  circular economy, recycle, reduce waste.  So the circularity in this way is basically through digital agriculture by doing the right  thing at the right time in the right place, electric robots and genetic improvement, not  
**[1:36:30-1:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:30):**  only just deeper roots, yes, 100%, nitrogen fixing roots.  Right?  So that will be, it's not impossible because we can do just about anything.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:41):**  It's a matter of time and investment if you can do that.  So imagine if fixing corn, I said, is still the king of the crop, right?  Over 20 tons of biomass produced, 10 are taken out, 10 are returned.  
**[1:36:55-1:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:55):**  Compared to any other thing, you return maybe two or three, that's three, four times.  You're gaining basically 10 years out of every two, three years.  So that, the additional piece is electrification for overbosh, you know, creating fertilizer,  
**[1:37:12-1:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:12):**  synthetic, synthetic, which is not necessarily a word of saying fertilizer, it's a way of  basically producing nitrogen the way natural is produced in terms of true decomposition,  but it's readily available.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:25):**  So if it is obtained on the farm by having energy, and that's a long term, we're talking  about future, right?  It can be 15, 20 years, maybe less, maybe more, depending on the investment on the vision  
**[1:37:37-1:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:37):**  of our leaders.  And if you produce fertilizer that is produced with electricity and not from fossil fuels,  then we win, then we can certainly obey one degrees and all the concentration of CO2.  
**[1:37:53-1:38:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:53):**  So we touched on what's available now, the digital agriculture, the modeling and the  forecasting and the robotics available now.  Rooting and generating is coming up for sure.  
**[1:38:05-1:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:05):**  And electrification also is coming, so if there are labs doing that, if you put it all  together, that's the pathway that I'm trying to publish.  One thing we talked about previously, and you got me thinking about it now today, was  
**[1:38:24-1:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:24):**  climate change and how this affects things.  So you have climate change happening, warming, and you have areas that are becoming, you  know, maybe warmer, sooner, warmer later, warmer during the course of the season.  
**[1:38:36-1:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:36):**  At the same time, you go back to like the tropics where organic matter is being volatilized  faster.  So if you heat everything up, you're burning more energy, but if you have warmer temperatures  
**[1:38:47-1:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:47):**  for longer, your yield potential goes up so you can potentially sequester more carbon.  How do those two fight against each other?  It's very good.  
**[1:38:56-1:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:56):**  You must have a PhD.  Good job.  So temperature, it plays a critical role.  
**[1:39:04-1:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:04):**  Remember that as temperature goes up, everything is expedited.  We sweat when it's hot.  Plants do the same thing.  
**[1:39:12-1:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:12):**  So the cycle, to explain this straight off that you're saying, climate change for, there  are winners and losers, right?  I've done some work in Siberia, and it's a potential being benefited because you have  
**[1:39:26-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:26):**  a much longer season.  Does it mean that in the middle of the summer it doesn't get hot?  No, it gets hotter.  
**[1:39:32-1:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:32):**  Does it mean, and then what does it mean?  They will still expedite development during that time.  So the answer to your question is adaptation, adaptation to new cultivars.  
**[1:39:46-1:40:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:46):**  So if you use the same cultivar that is getting warmer and you only planted earlier because  you know it's warmer, you're running short at the end.  You're not taking advantage because the faster development that occurs, the degree days,  
**[1:40:00-1:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:00):**  the heat units that the plant has to accumulate, it will accumulate no matter what.  They will accumulate now in August instead of mid-September if you anticipate.  But if you have a much longer duration cultivar, then now you are sequestering a much greater  
**[1:40:15-1:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:15):**  yield.  In fact, if you simulate a long duration cultivar, you basically have a much longer time to do  growth.  
**[1:40:25-1:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:25):**  And so if you quickly allow me to explain, the plant does two processes.  It grows and develops.  The development is the cycle, is the duration of our long season on the ground.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:37):**  That's set by the minutes.  Okay.  That's set by number of degree days that is set.  
**[1:40:42-1:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:42):**  If it gets hot, those degree days are reached much quicker because the degree days are calculated  as the air temperature minus the temperature that we call base temperature.  The temperature below which the plant does not develop, stays in the same technological  
**[1:40:58-1:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:58):**  stages, doesn't go to the next phase.  Growth is the accumulation of biomass, is a physical way of accumulation, more heavier,  basically kilograms accumulated.  
**[1:41:10-1:41:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:10):**  So back to the 10 things and 100 things, instead of the selection, if you and I go have a different,  I have 10 minutes to eat as much as I want and you have an hour, you will always eat  more because you have an hour.  
**[1:41:25-1:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:25):**  So that hour is the longer growing cycle that you have because of a cooler possibility of  not reaching those degree days in a much longer period of time.  And so the higher the temperature, the shorter the cycle, the shorter the plants are going  
**[1:41:44-1:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:44):**  to be on that, the lower probability of the lower accumulation of photosynthesis.  They're just less on that piece of land.  They sequester less carbon through photosynthesis.  
**[1:41:54-1:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:54):**  So to your question is adaptation is if you use now a genetics that allows you to anticipate  your planning, you cannot necessarily eliminate the heat in the middle of the summer, but  you have now a longer period and you could sequester more and return more carbon into  
**[1:42:12-1:42:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:12):**  the soils.  That's kind of a perverse way we can use global warming to our advantage to pull carbon out.  Exactly.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:22):**  So many it is and the places in the north are better than they say is the next, the  corn belt already now because you see the shift, the amount of corn that is grown in  North Dakota, Minnesota, going into Canada, Saskatchewan.  
**[1:42:38-1:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:38):**  I mean, what's the first thing you call it?  It's just getting better.  And so that's a benefit.  
**[1:42:46-1:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:46):**  Was it the same amount of carbon sequestered before you had corn there?  Far from it because the amount biomass that they're corn sequestered, right, is much greater.  So that's exactly, they're winners.  
**[1:42:58-1:43:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:58):**  And does it get harder in places like, unfortunately it's always like this, you know, the harder  place will get worse and so the more vulnerable areas are the ones that are already kind of  in a more dire situation because more heat, more storms, greater storms, greater humidity  
**[1:43:20-1:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:20):**  in the atmosphere just creates obviously these extreme events and so on that is negative  in addition to the higher temperature, which expedites the compositions and low organic  matter at the moment.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38):**  One of the problems we've talked about today and you brought this up again in a previous  conversation was, so we know nitrogen is a problem today, overuse of nitrogen.  And you talked about some things you looked at in Italy where it was nitrogen management  
**[1:43:52-1:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:52):**  of how much nitrogen you're putting on versus nitrogen that's coming out in yield in the  form of protein content in the crop.  And there's not a lot of that here.  
**[1:44:02-1:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:02):**  I think that's a topic that a lot of people have heard nothing about.  I don't know really anything about it other than what I've heard from you.  Can you talk about that and maybe how that could shift the way we look at agriculture  
**[1:44:15-1:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:15):**  and with the way maybe producers farm?  Yeah.  I mean, as you know, California is very much like Italy.  
**[1:44:23-1:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:23):**  We're really blessed with the way the agriculture is in these areas in terms of the possibility  of having so many sunny days.  And so that's a possibility with good soils is a possibility of having products that they're  
**[1:44:40-1:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:40):**  much more favorable in terms of quality and just taste.  But besides the vegetables growing in these areas and the possibility of smaller scale  agriculture and spoon feeding and lower amount of fertilizer, there's almost no fertilizer  
**[1:44:57-1:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:57):**  used in these small patches of the quick rotations that I was mentioning earlier.  I'm just describing the more high quality, slow food type of approach that goes into  these soils to the schools and really high level of food and so on.  
**[1:45:18-1:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:18):**  What I've worked on for several times was an interesting question from producers of  pasta production.  Pasta is a very good food for vegans and pasta everyone is attracted.  
**[1:45:33-1:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:33):**  I know it is a carb and then people are more fearful of using it in an accumulate way instead  of thinking of giving you the available energy to exercise and to do things and so on.  So it's a very stable food obviously in Italy and so it contains normally about 12-13% proteins.  
**[1:45:54-1:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:54):**  So both the pasta for the companies like Parilla and Chico have pushed farmers to increase  the protein content which is a greater quality, a better product that here unfortunately as  far as I've talked to several wheat boards and growers and the use is much more for different  
**[1:46:18-1:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:18):**  topics you know crackers, lower quality and so the way you manage nitrogen there, first  of all is lower in terms of amount because there's not enough water.  It has to be very well synchronized when it's applied.  
**[1:46:35-1:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:35):**  It uses less nitrogen obviously then because it's a smaller biomass than maize but the  timing of application plays a critical role in the way the proteins are accumulated and  the interesting fact that this pasta production company made is yes we want higher protein  
**[1:46:56-1:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:56):**  content but that has to be coupled with a good grain.  You can have higher protein content but it can be all grain.  It's like really shivered more concentrated grain smaller and in Italy they say that will  
**[1:47:12-1:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:12):**  give that to the chicken and not for pasta production.  So that can be 17-18%.  So the weight of the grains are weighted in 100 you know in a ataletric weight and there  
**[1:47:24-1:47:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:24):**  are different testing test weights and so on.  So the coupling of the quality of the grain with the endosperm and the protein means that  you have to manage the crop well throughout and which means feeding the crop two three  
**[1:47:39-1:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:39):**  times fertilizer to basically make use of it and matching with the demand.  So long story short if you put nitrogen towards the end of the uptake in wheat it goes all  into proteins and so now you can have easily 14-15% protein and growers get a premium and  
**[1:48:00-1:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:00):**  it's a substantial premium from an economic point of view.  It's an excessive incentive it's an additional incentives that they value because they were  growing wheat no matter what they have incentives from the European Union so they do relatively  
**[1:48:17-1:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:17):**  well in terms of matching both a better management of a crop in addition to satisfying the demands  until they get paid with a premium.  But it comes from the private sector.  
**[1:48:30-1:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:30):**  The government in Italy and the European commissions provides incentives from an environmental  standpoint the amount of needs to be used so the uniqueness was through this work is  giving the right amount at the right time at the right place with the goal not just  
**[1:48:46-1:49:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:46):**  having higher yield but also higher quality of the grains higher proteins.  You know being in the Midwest I mean do you think we're too yield centric now where a  lot of application is just focus on bushels per acre and it's not quality and I don't  
**[1:49:02-1:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:02):**  think that's necessarily a big farm problem I think that probably translates all the way  down to the smallest farms it's I need to produce volume and I'm not focusing enough  and it sounds like a complex problem and a grower really has to know their operation  
**[1:49:18-1:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:18):**  where a plant is in the cycle and I don't know that there's an easy way to solve that  but you know that seems like that's another future wave here of amending and growing for  nutrient quantity and quality versus just weight volume.  
**[1:49:38-1:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:38):**  You have identified that's the current way of how you know the farmers get paid on productivity  but I think there are three ways they can do you know basically productivity they can  be monetized the environment and they can do better quality of the product if the consumers  
**[1:49:56-1:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:56):**  and so as you know Diego I mean agriculture is divided is agriculture and food system  behind agriculture there is a significant amount of interest by multinational in managing  the supplies you know got seeds fertilizer and so that drives they want to make sure  
**[1:50:17-1:50:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:17):**  that the seeds that they sell are optimized best conditions to get the greatest yield  greatest yield means more money to the farmer there's no dent in that calculation there's  three trillion kind of huge amount of money behind that concept and at the same time consumers  
**[1:50:36-1:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:36):**  say hey I can't drink the water in Toledo it's like what are you guys doing and you  got to be doing things better now they already farmers are pulled back and say oh okay so  we can't really do all these applications and we got to do that but the consumers need  
**[1:50:54-1:51:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:54):**  to realize that farm we in science we know a significant amount of money but sometimes  they're not adopted because of profitability because of you know that will cost it will  cost to the farmer and so somewhere they need to become you know basically either generates  
**[1:51:12-1:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:12):**  immediate money to the farmer some ways or and they need to be paid incentivized to basically  be able to adopt their consumers at the same time so where does this money come does it  always have to come from the government could come from a greater price so if you have three  
**[1:51:25-1:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:25):**  dollar eighty for a component if it was seven dollars that could afford some of that in  terms of managing better reducing the deal because now they have a better price and that  price will be compensated by the consumers wanting to do that and then and the farmers  
**[1:51:41-1:51:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:41):**  are the last one to really make money because think how much it costs you know stake that  the grains has been fed versus you know the grain itself so the food system is very important  in quality I wish we would have you know always the quality we would we have now just been  
**[1:51:59-1:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:59):**  exposed that we want things all the time right and there was there's no more seasonality  there is no more in Italy there is again this concept of you know zero miles low by local  I mean here too is becoming more important but a big producers that has a massive amount  
**[1:52:17-1:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:17):**  also wants to be able to export so it is a very complex system and so both the the profitability  the environmental sustainability and the environmental justice for the community they have to come  together and we're trying to do that with this more circularity making the system more  
**[1:52:39-1:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:39):**  circular there is science that has these visions about what we talked about which was not not  a you know science fiction movie that's basically happening it was just a trailer and that will  happen so I think that's the complexity of justify now that they get paid on productivity  
**[1:53:02-1:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:02):**  but it could change if everybody is willing to put their own their interest away in coming  together of participating to that table by chipping in.  Yeah in the state of Italy you mentioned you grew up around a system it was wheat, grapes,  
**[1:53:17-1:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:17):**  olives, pecans.  I think that okay yeah I think that is a that poly culture system is a lot of what newer  people looking to get into ag romanticize about how do you see I mean having seen systems  
**[1:53:35-1:53:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:35):**  like that why why do you think there have kind of been abandoned you don't see them  as much outside of Europe and is there a viable future in that type of system?  I have an optimistic look on that because new generation is becoming more attracted  
**[1:53:57-1:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:57):**  to the land to be able to do things I see a lot more young people wanting to do as you  know agriculture is such a hard work and I think the combination of being green sustainable  quality food being the food system in the open space obviously has so much attraction  
**[1:54:18-1:54:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:18):**  that's one of the reason I wanted to be in agriculture is actually to help to produce  food and you know for the poor and so on but I ended up here by I use system that they  go globally but and sustainability from an environmental standpoint so I think Europe  
**[1:54:37-1:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:37):**  has maintained because the way the population is I mean Naples metropolitan area is you  know four million and then there are patches of land everywhere and growing and you can  buy the just the best zucchini vegetables and so on when when the season is right and  
**[1:54:58-1:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:58):**  here you have that example in California I'm sure I mean it's just much more present there  some parts in the New York outside the city and just about any city so we basically we're  going towards a little bit more urban agriculture in many ways the term may not be right but  
**[1:55:16-1:55:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:16):**  that's what it really is right you know this polyculture the size is the land sizes makes  a difference because imagine a small grower can't afford to have you know very net investment  in much large machineries right and because of the sizes and so the size is compensated  
**[1:55:35-1:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:35):**  by having people to work and be able to be very dynamic and be building that soil health  and so on but when you deal with the Midwest where your neighbor is 50 miles away you know  you know you got and also the Midwest is still the Midwest because you can grow corn without  
**[1:55:51-1:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:51):**  irrigation you know 15% only of the Midwest is irrigated there is a demand for grains  for you know feed the cows there is a demand for more vegan more plant-based so there will  be a natural transition I envision not to necessarily not that I wish but not to see  
**[1:56:13-1:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:13):**  a major change in the way the land is distributed in terms of corn just because it's for the  reason that I've said but I would see a significant amount of I've actually seen in Michigan much  much more it's one after California is the most diverse type of agriculture and so a  
**[1:56:33-1:56:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:33):**  lot of the farmers that we work with very progressive they also have few acres unfortunately  you know of vegetables the season is much shorter so they have to be dealing with that  so I think it's a transition Diego that is slowly happening you see much more fresh market  
**[1:56:50-1:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:50):**  you know farmers going to them at the farmers market is beautiful farmers marketing Detroit  it's a yeah it's it's the way the cities are distributed and it's happening slowly but  surely also here.  
**[1:57:06-1:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:06):**  And just to close this out there's a lot of vegetable farmers listening to this smaller  landholdings what would you encourage vegetable farmers to do to to build soil carbon to sequester  carbon to grow better crops like what can they do in their systems given that they're  
**[1:57:26-1:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:26):**  fast rotations of crops what can a vegetable farmer do?  I don't know if I necessarily have any suggestion for them because I believe they already do  a pretty good job I mean to grow a vegetable you have to have a good soil the the things  
**[1:57:47-1:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:47):**  that we covered is just suddenly trying to minimize the amount of big tillage you know  not flipping the soil is certainly if you want to go technical I wanted to be more philosophical  that I think they already do a good job rotation is already something that is critical very  
**[1:58:05-1:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:05):**  very simply keep the soil covered don't farm naked you know basically keep the soil covered  eventually hopefully one day say Bruno said they will I'll get paid by the amount of days  my soil is green and hopefully that could happen so the tillage is really the mechanisms  
**[1:58:25-1:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:25):**  that does not allow that allows carbon to be lost you know immediately but if you retain  if you keep the jar more closed within the limits of what the vegetables that you're  growing some of them obviously will love carrots will love onions well those are but they can  
**[1:58:43-1:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:43):**  be done on a smaller scale to be able to still use regenerative type of approaches so if  tillage is unavoidable be able to keep the soil cover and adding organic amendments it's  certainly you know the way to do it I think any possibilities of using new technologies  
**[1:59:05-1:59:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:05):**  I'm not you know don't want to do the balance of economics but eventually one day there  would be possibility of robotics one thing that really broke my heart during this pandemic  obviously was seeing these vegetables people not having food in the supermarket and far  
**[1:59:21-1:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:21):**  fields not be able to be harvested so that's very sad California many and so eventually  there will be technologies is coming and that doesn't mean it's going to fully replace people  because they need many but you want to be also more independent from these sorts of  
**[1:59:41-2:00:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:41):**  threats that we may be witnessing unfortunately when more people come you know more frequently  so technologies be able to collect data on what they learn from the past be able to collect  what we call you know now this big data be analyzed and learn and analyze this data with  
**[2:00:01-2:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:01):**  help of scientists or anyone able to support their decisions because there is a lot of  we always say if you can understand the past you can infer about the future there are changes  in the future but you could predict some of those because some of the things are just  
**[2:00:18-2:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:18):**  frequent are more frequently repeating but we have had extreme event in the past they're  just more frequent now right yeah and people can learn more about the work you're doing  at cebo technologies.com for one last thing I mean being so involved in modeling carbon  
**[2:00:36-2:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:36):**  credit space do you see a day not too far ahead where any grower regardless of size  could say here's what I'm doing I can sell carbon credits?  I think it's a lot closer than you may think Diego I certainly hope so that's what actually  
**[2:00:56-2:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:56):**  cebo is pushing for forward is to be able to be able to quantify the regenerative potentials  of saying I've done these practices that they can be verified and then we know how much  carbon is going in and it's the strength of this is but how do you know is also the combination  
**[2:01:18-2:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:18):**  that we talked about is the abatement what are you not emitting by doing certain level  of things and so it's in addition is both sequestration as well as reduction in the  emissions that needs to be rewarded.  
**[2:01:34-2:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:34):**  Yes so start building your soil now so you can maybe get paid for that later.  Certainly starting your soil one day this podcast will say those guys said it that the  future will look more bright because of all this technology coming together and hopefully  
**[2:01:50-2:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:50):**  yes that that time is not too far but you need to build your carbon in order to stay  healthy keep the soil healthy produce good quality crop and be able to maintain this  consumer demand of transparency because I think overall the farmers are really honest  
**[2:02:10-2:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:10):**  genuine good steward of the environment and the land and anything that I can do to help  in promoting science and information like accepting the invitation to speak with you  today is really to show off the hard work that they do but all of that we have said  
**[2:02:27-2:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:27):**  it was above the parts and there is lots of there is all true to it need to build carbon  and it will pay back.  Thank you.

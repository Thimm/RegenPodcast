### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 09 Dec 2020 19:30:27)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Carbon â€“ it's the building block of life.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  When it comes to soil, it's critically important.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  But how well do you fully understand carbon when it comes to soil science?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  For example, do you know the difference between percent organic matter and percent carbon  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  in the soil?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  Because there is a difference.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  As farmers and gardeners, our goal is to put as much carbon as we can into the soil.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  Why is that?  
**[0:00:53-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  Because soil doesn't use carbon, soil actually loses carbon.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:00):**  Today to answer some of those questions and many more, we're exploring the mysteries  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  of the soil with Dr. Bruno Basso of Michigan State University in SIBO Technologies.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  Starting your soil one day, this podcast will say, those guys stated that the future will  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  look more bright because of all this technology coming together and hopefully, yes, that time  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  is not too far, but you need to build your carbon in order to stay healthy.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  Keep the soil healthy, produce good quality crop.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  So there will be a day when you'll get paid for growing crops and putting carbon into  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:37):**  the soil.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  Let's take a glimpse into what that future looks like and join the conversation with  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  Dr. Bruno Basso.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  One thing I want to start on today was carbon sequestration.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:53):**  How do you view carbon sequestration when it comes to soil?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  So yes, carbon sequestration is a pretty hot topic.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  It's covered in the media extensively and we should ask why, why is it that?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  I would say a soil with no carbon is like a body with no soil.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  This is just basically the life of the soil.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  And the goal is to sequester carbon, which meaning taking it from the atmosphere through  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  the process of photosynthesis.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  As you know, we convert the energy from the sun into carbon and carbon is sequestered  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  to by the plants and is accumulated in the soil in two ways.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:45):**  One is by having roots growing in the soil, that's organic compounds, organic materials,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:52):**  they stay in the soil.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  And at the end of the growing cycle, when you have anything that we call, you know,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  sober residues, you obviously want to keep them in the ground because that's carbon that  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  was sequestered from the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  And so carbon is sequestered by accumulating carbon by putting carbon in the soil.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  Carbon is not generated automatically.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  It's actually lost from the soil as a process of microbial decomposition.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  So if that provides a general, you know, ground for you to understand, carbon is critical  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  because it has so many positive aspects.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  And so I'll leave it there for now.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  And again, the goal is trying to keep as much carbon in the soil because think of carbon  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  as a health source of check.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:51):**  If you have carbon in the soil, you more on the healthy side.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  If you have less carbon in the soil, you may be running into potential problems.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  Obviously depends on the type of systems and the type of management that you do.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  You can certainly compensate a lot of the negativity of not having carbon through management.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  So if carbon, as we may continue in this conversation on carbon, it helps retaining water.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  And what could it be if you don't have carbon you irrigate, but you may not be able to do  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  that.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  It may, there is cost involved and there is energy involved and there is a strong component.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  So if that helps, that's generally my view, you do want to sequester as much carbon as  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  possible.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  And because you don't control, you control partially the way the plants grow through  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:46):**  the management, you want to accumulate the roots, but the critical piece is adding carbon  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  to the soil in many different ways.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  Do you have a sense of a natural system, say a healthy ecosystem that is just out there,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  a meadow, a prairie, a forest.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  Is there an average net gain or loss in carbon to the soil?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  So plants are using carbon out of the atmosphere and they're putting some of that into the  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:18):**  soil.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  The microbes are respiring it.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  They're putting out oxygen.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  The plants are putting out oxygen in the process.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  At the end of the day, if you put that system in a vacuum, does it balance itself out where  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  if one unit of carbon comes out of the atmosphere, one ends up in the soil?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:36):**  Very, very good question.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  Imagine the prairies, you know, imagine virgin land with vegetation, like you said, that  
**[0:05:49-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  has already at a level of carbon that has a mineral soils may be at saturation.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  So is in balance.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:00):**  However, you know, through the winter plants die, they grow back.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  They sequester as much as is lost if they are at saturation.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  Saturation means roughly about 5% of the soil organic carbon that can be stored.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  So prairies don't ever go to 15, 20%, 30%.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  That's very difficult.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  Sometimes I even hear all my soil organic carbon is going to 20%.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  That's a little bit different.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  You have an organic matter compound, but you really were talking about soil carbon, soil  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  carbon that remains in the soil that brings all the positive aspects.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  Now if you are not a saturation, see it as a bucket.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  If you see that and you tilled, you basically have done something to that land.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:53):**  Imagine that land as a jar.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  If you open that jar, there it goes, a big flush of CO2 carbon dioxide as a result of  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  this respiration from microbes, they go into the atmosphere.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  So if the bucket now is just basically you lost, imagine drinking out of a bucket, you  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  lower.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  Now you have a gap and that could be regained.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  So in the accumulation now of doing photosynthesis and basically accumulating roots, now you  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  slowly building back up because you are now you have a room for it.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:34):**  The problem in the managed system, you keep bringing it down.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  You keep drinking out of this bucket that you really have little left, but much greater  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:44):**  potential to accumulate.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  The problem is what do we do?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  We put some, we take up, we take as much or more.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  And so is this continuous fluctuation.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  And that's why I needed to start for you to understand that the example that you started  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  with starts possibly at a saturation and not much more can be gained.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  But in general, yes, it can be sequestered compared to the amount of what is lost through  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  respiration and how can it be by don't touch it.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  Don't touch the soil.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  If you touch the soil, you break the aggregates.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  And what happens if you break the aggregate?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  You basically open the jar.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  You basically open that aggregate of soil that is exposed to soil microbes that they  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  made out of carbon, they eat carbon and they expel carbon.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  That's basically what they are.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  And so this in form of CO2 gets released into the atmosphere.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:45):**  What we accumulate through virtual, you know, good practices like no tillage or cover crop,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:53):**  it really depends on where you are in the level of degradation.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  If you have room to accumulate, you should do so and maintain it.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  Unfortunately, as soon as you break this virtuous cycle and you till or you remove, basically  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  you don't continue doing that, then you start basically dipping in almost seeing as a bank  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:16):**  account, you know, as you accumulate.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  But if you keep drawing out more than you put in, then you start losing.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  So I don't know if I was clear, but it's again, the complexity stays on where are you at in  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:31):**  terms of your potential?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  When you sequester it and are you keeping it for a long time?  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:37):**  Because these accumulations we're talking, I don't necessarily want to give you numbers  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  that people may not relate, but a cover crop could sequester, you know, basically, you  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  know, one, one ton of carbon and depending on the volume and the bulk density of the  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  soil and where you start, it will make a very little bend.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  It will be like 1.01 now and it keeps slowly.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  So it takes a long time to accumulate carbon.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  And at some point in the conversation, Diego, I think we should address why it's important.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  We said it obviously, yes, it is the life, but it has so many positive aspects in addition  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  to the climate benefits.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  The climate benefit meaning of we all aware of CO2 being much greater concentration than  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  before simply put that we had how many more cars do we have compared to 50 years ago?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  That's petrol that was in the bow of the earth.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  There was carbon in the bow of the earth and now we put it into the atmosphere.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  So that remains a stronger sector.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:45):**  But agriculture plays a role and I see it as a solution rather than a, you know, the  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  problem, even though we do contribute roughly in the range that, you know, ranges between  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:00):**  12, 14 or so, 15 percent of the anthropogenic CO2 is emitted comes from agriculture.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:06):**  And the majority of that comes from end to end.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  We probably will get there in the conversation about abatement.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  But let me just add the positive aspect to that.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  If you retain carbon because carbon creates a glue, like a physical glue that the aggregates  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  are glued together.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  When water goes in that it retains, it stays there much longer.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  The microbes basically can't go in, but the roots can slowly and be able to use this water  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  when it's needed.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  So first benefit, a greater capacity of holding water for longer time.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  And that's critical because it helps stabilize yields, especially in an environment where  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  water may be, you know, more limiting.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  As this is the carbon of microbes, they still decompose.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:02):**  There is a release of nutrients that is also, you know, very, very important in terms of  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  adjusting the possible management that you will add on with fertilizer, which could be  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  less if you have higher organic matter and the decomposition allows the release of nitrogen.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  So they're both properties are physical in terms of again, retaining more water, chemical  
**[0:12:26-0:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  carton exchange capacity, more nutrients can be used by the roots and then biological because  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:35):**  it increases the activity, the presence of microbes, which have a very strong positive  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  effect on the overall health of the plants.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  What constitutes carbon saturation in the soil?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:51):**  Is that a property of the mineral makeup of that soil, so, you know, sand, silt, clay  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:58):**  that is?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  Yes indeed.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  Okay, and then when it gets to that saturation point, let's say I have soil X, it's at saturation,  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  like I can't put more carbon into the soil at that point.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  Does that mean, does that somehow affect the evolution of plant life above it?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:17):**  Meaning if they were producing 1.1 units of carbon and they needed one, soil can't absorb  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  that extra 0.1, where is that one going, are plants dying off to basically say, okay, we  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  need to deplete carbon in the soil?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:34):**  So you frame it correctly that the upper threshold, it is set by the physical properties.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  So a soil is composed by about, you know, 25% water, 5% carbon and the rest is mineral.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  Okay, so percentage between sand, silt and clay.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  So when you are at that level of roughly in, in fact, they're called mineral soils.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  We can go to the Isto soils, the organic, the peat soils where they can go 50% carbon,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  but they become, that's like a mine territory because if you put them and you just almost  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  look at them by scratching who big release of CO2 they go.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:23):**  So they can be mitigated and there can be things done to them, but they are so on a  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  very small percentage of areas that they're not going to be a critical piece in the future.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  But so this, the, the mineral soils, once they reach this, yes, vegetation is, but the  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  vegetation what you didn't necessarily plants build carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  So that carbon is, it's not, it's not used.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  It's if you don't till it, it remains the way it is.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:03):**  So roots grow, die off and nothing changes.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  So it's at equilibrium.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  There is no extra.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:12):**  If you put a big change vegetation, the thing is change vegetation requires some change  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  of a physical change.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  You got to, so if it isn't natural change that, you know, wind brings a different, that's  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  more a climate related, what temperature and in the prairies there are, there is a, basically  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  an evolution of which species predominates, you know, the grass is over and that's very  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:36):**  important to maintain the, you know, the biodiversity for the benefits of the microbes.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  But when you are in situation of saturation, you will very well confirm that the prairies  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  wouldn't change.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  In terms of they're, they're balancing themselves out there in equilibrium.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  Balancing themselves out.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  The roots they die, they get, you know, rebuilt and that number does not change.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:02):**  So thinking about that in a cultivation sense.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  Now we move to man coming in here.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:08):**  And you have a grower, let's say their, let's say their soils were at carbon saturation  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  due to just good growing practices, whatever that means.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  And they start adding additional organic matter to the soil surface, compost, manures, some  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:25):**  sort of organic mulch.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  If the soil is already at carbon saturation, you're adding all this new carbon to the soil  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  what, what happens?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:38):**  It basically it's lost.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:40):**  It reaches the term, the term carbon is the element of carbon.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  It remains at that percent.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  It remains, if it is a mineral soils, you would increase the organic matter.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  You know, you could have, I mean, think of a big pile of manure.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  That's much greater percentage of, you know, organic compounds, but it's different than  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  the organic carbon as an element that we're saying.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  The reason there is not necessarily to worry about that problem.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  It's a good problem to have because 5% organic matter, I mean, 5% carbon is 10% organic matter.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  There is difference between carbon is organic matter is 58% carbon.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  So we're already looking at 10% organic matter, not being in organic soils and is the soils  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  hard to see.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  If you go to the thumb in Michigan where I'm located, those are 15, 20% organic, but those  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  are PD soils.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  Those are, those are is the soils.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  They're very different mineral compositions, totally different individuals, totally different  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  beasts.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  So it's not a problem that we really face or we worry about, Oh, I don't want you far  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  from having 5% organic carbon, which means, you know, 10, 4% organic matter.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  You will need to keep adding nutrients.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  I mean, amendments in the form of carbon to be able to reach as close as possible.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  The secret Diego is that the main issue of what we may do a good job is that we often  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  lose that carbon by opening the jar.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  And that's very hard to comprehend in terms of saying, well, I have to, I'm a vegetable  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  grower.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:33):**  You have to fully understand if you don't produce vegetable, we won't be healthy in  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  terms.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:39):**  So there is always a trade off.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:40):**  There is, there shouldn't be fanaticism about things.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  Yes, you do want to reach that.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:46):**  You don't want to have a total, what we call soil inversion tillage where you flip, you  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  know, marble plow, you basically remove, you just flipped 30 centimeters, you know, a foot  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  of soil upside down, bringing all the microbes, the activity as you know, it used to be in  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  the past.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:04):**  So the more heavy source of tillage, if you scrape the surface and you, you basically  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  your damage in terms of carbon losses is mitigated and it's not very much in terms of losses  
**[0:19:17-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  because you can compensate by having graded yield and accumulation of roots and adding  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  compounds and because you want to build that soil organic carbon for all the benefits that  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  we just said, be able to hold water, be able to release nutrients, have healthy soil.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:38):**  It's just the synonymous of a healthy situation if you have that carbon.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  No, one thing I don't want to get lost in is data at the expense of reality here.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:51):**  So 5% carbon saturation point, like that sounds great.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  You know, you're up at high organic matter content.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  Does that translate for a grower to mean that if you had 5% carbon where you're saturated  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  in carbon that you would have better plant growth versus if you had say 2.5% carbon?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  Is that a fair assumption?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  Like is more carbon, meaning the plants that I'm growing are probably growing to be more  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  healthy?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:22):**  That's a very good, very good question, Diego.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  The answer will be probably not as much unless you have a particular situation in terms of  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  climate.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  Okay, so if you are on a relatively good year, if we're talking about California and you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  obviously regave, you wouldn't because you're compensating for that additionality of water  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  storage that you will get from the soil organic carbon.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  And then it will make a big difference if you have the high organic.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  Let's say a vegetable growers in the Midwest that has a relatively good soil, 2% in under  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  a conditions of good distribution of rainfall.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  It's that additional carbon and water storage is a stabilizer for situation.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  When does for situation they're more vulnerable?  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  When does no tillage, if you hear in the literature, when does no tillage really makes a difference?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:29):**  In the dry years.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  Understand, so it is that situation.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  It's hard to put it in frame, you know, how much yield increase would I get?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  Almost nothing.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  If it's sufficiently rainfall, would you still compensate with some manure or some additional  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  nutrients then suddenly no difference.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  You leave that soil alone, you don't touch, you don't put rainfall, you don't do anything.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  If it is a dry year, big difference, 5% wins.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  If it is a normal year and a relatively good distribution of rainfall and so on, possibly  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  not a huge difference.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:10):**  But I hope I make the main, it's in the dry in a more difficult situation.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  What about in terms of microbiology?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:19):**  You know, you or me, there's 10 pizzas there and there's five pizzas.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  You know, five pizzas is great, but man, if there's 10 to choose from, whoa, like we can  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  really pig out and go nuts.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  Is it fair to say microbial life would behave differently at a higher percentage?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  Spot on, spot on.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  But the question you asked earlier was immediate change in a yearly in terms of yields.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  No, on a long term, a 5% is 100 pizza to choose from.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  It's like 10 menus of 10 restaurants to choose from versus a much smaller.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:57):**  We have experience and data from the Kellogg biological station at Michigan State University  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:04):**  that has a long term site.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  Basically the no tillage has been accumulating carbon slowly going up, but we're still talking  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  in the range of, you know, 1.5, 2%.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  But the amount of microbial activity and the biodiversity that is present in plots where,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  you know, greater biodiversity of plants, you know, even different, the microbiomes  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:29):**  on plants, we are finding to be extremely important.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  That brings eventually a conversation that we may touch on rotations.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  You know, the possibility of changing the type of vegetation that you have in the soil.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  That's extremely.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  So to provide again the final answer to your question, yes, much broader possibility of  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  having the strong guy, the short guy, the fastest, then all the possible qualities of  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:01):**  these microbes be able to satisfy, you know, bringing the nutrients all in the water versus  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  more of a limited food.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:09):**  But you play with what you have, but you identify correctly that the winner is in the expanded  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  portfolio of microbes and micro, yet microbiomes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  You know, through a lot of the work that you've done, let's say, well, we know a lot of cultivated  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  soils are degenerative and they're low on that carbon saturation point.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  Are there specific plants or crops that are net carbon sequesterers, like they are going  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  to end up putting more in than they take out at the end of the day?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  So that question, like the complexity behind it, it depends on if you isolate a plant by  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  itself without management associated with it is one story.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  If you manage, so the example that obviously comes natural would be a corn plant, right?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:17):**  You know, a corn versus a native, a switchgrass or a native, a mix of native vegetation.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  Now corn, if it is managed properly, can reach a significant amount of biomass that is accumulated  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  and still one of the king of the crops.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  It sequesters more carbon than a forest at saturation because you will, saturation meaning  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  that has already growth.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  But even yearly when you accumulate the woods, what does the forest brings in terms of sequestering  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  the leaves, then the leaves come.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  So that's to put it in numbers, a forest request about eight tons and a corn crop on average  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:01):**  will be at least 20 tons.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  But is it a net?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  No, because corn uses fertilizer and then that goes down the drain already, the emissions  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:12):**  and all the life cycle analysis and we can go there.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  The perennials, we have, for example, one crop, miscanthus gigantus.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:23):**  I don't know if you've heard, this one bio, new bioenergy cellulosic crop.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  The yield is 50 tons.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:32):**  Naturally.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  So no fertilizer.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  It fixes somehow, it just doesn't depend.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  So in the amount of roots and rhizobium that it accumulates, it's massive.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:42):**  So that will go.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  The problem with miscanthus is that can be an invasive species.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  And so DOE, the Department of Energy that has funded the bioenergy centers across the  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:55):**  nations has almost allocated, University of Illinois is looking at miscanthus missing  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:01):**  a state and University of Wisconsin are looking at switchgrass that has much more of a broad  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  range of possibility of growing.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  But switchgrass on average would accumulate about eight tons of biomass.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  So those are the natural behavior to answer your question.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  Big differences in plant.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:21):**  Wheat is five tons maximum and half of that will be, you know, could be grains.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:26):**  And so I'm talking about in general average total and the primary productivity of that  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  particular crop.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  But I want to spend a minute on saying that people may not realize that nowadays the level  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  of photosynthesis done through two things, improved genetics and management, basically  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  spoon feeding a crop, we have reached the level of yield of corn of 600 bushels.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:55):**  So the average national is 170 bushels and world record for the last four or five years  
**[0:28:02-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  has been in the range of close to 580, 50 and 600 the last one, 615 actually, which  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  when you convert it into total biomass, we're talking about now 50 tons per hectare.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:19):**  But the amount of that's very positive emitter because of the amount of it doesn't accumulate  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:27):**  carbon per se because of the balances through the amount of inputs that they're used.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  As I initially said, Diego, with agriculture being an anthropogenic component to the climate  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  is through fertilizer addition, we lose 50 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions coming  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:47):**  from agriculture come from into all emissions.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  And so that's another balance because even the potential of total accumulation of carbon  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  is still requires nitrogen to go with it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  There is a CN ratio.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  So you will always be depleted by nitrogen unless you add fertilizer.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:07):**  So if you want to fill all the soils with five percent in the globe, it will be equivalent  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  to have 75 percent of the fertilizer production that we currently have in the world, which  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  is really, really heavy source of emissions.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  Now that doesn't mean that that fertilizer has to come from synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  There are legumes that can be produced.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  So if we want to come back to the species, yes, different species have different capacity,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  have different photosynthetic capacity and rates of accumulating carbon per unit area.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  The amount of this carbon, remember, there is a component above the plant, but there  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:48):**  is also roots.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:49):**  So there is this root shoot composition that actually in situation where water is not available,  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  roots become deeper.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  And so basically the plants provide this feedback mechanisms of saying, OK, the roots is, I'm  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  going to do this.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  There is actually a simple way to think if plants is exposed to a stress and the stress  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  comes from above, what would it be a stress coming from above?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:19):**  Reduced light, right?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  You know, shading from then the all the simulates will go to the top and the plants will try  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  and go faster, you know, try to elevate.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  If the stress comes from the soil, the soil gets the priority.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  The plant, the part of the plants in the soil.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  So if there is a water stress, plants doesn't grow higher, actually says, OK, no problem.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:43):**  I'm going to invert, shuts down the photosynthetic.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  Some of the simulates go down to the roots because remember, it's not photosynthesizing,  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  but the roots are growing because they are desperately in search of water.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  And so you get more roots that way.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  So this mechanism changes by species.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  But to again, to your question, yes, different species, different capacity.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  And I mean, a separation in the beginning depends how they manage.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  So if corn is managed with no fertilizer and it lets grow for so many years, it will be  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  far from getting 600 bushel.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  You barely get 100, you know, 100 bushel at the end because you run out of, the corn is  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  a very highly consumptive crops because of the sizes and it doesn't fix nitrogen on its  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:30):**  own like miscants.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  So I actually switched grass pretty well without fertilizer.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  So there is that mechanism that complicates even things.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  On fertilizer emissions being a big source of greenhouse gases, are all fertilizers critical?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  So if we had chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers, manures or byproducts from the  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  animal processing industry, do those contribute to greenhouse gases equally?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  No, they don't.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  So synthetic fertilizer are immediate emission.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  You put them and you have these big flashes of, again, at the Kello biological station,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  we have a series of long term data, the long term ecological research site led by Phil  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  Robertson for so many years now, Nick, they've been measuring into just basically continuously  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:24):**  right on automatic chambers.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  And so it's very, depends on the amount of water that, you know, after the rain there  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:32):**  is so synthetic fertilizer immediately.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  And you may be aware of this is basically about roughly 1% of the fertilizer there is  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  added.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  This is a very simple concept.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  It's called the mission factor that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has done a very comprehensive  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  review of looking at fertilizer rates, comparison and emission.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  And so there was a consistent number.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:03):**  You put 100 pounds, you lose one pound.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:06):**  And the problem is that one kilogram of N2O is 300 kilograms of CO2.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  It's 300 times more powerful in the global warming potential, like much rougher in the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:19):**  atmosphere.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  It traps a lot more, 300 times more powerful.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  And so manure, it's an organic form.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  Okay, it does not have, plants do not use nitrogen in the organic form.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  They have to be mineralized.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:34):**  So mineralized first in form of, you know, from N2 to NO3 and then it can be used or  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  nitrification to NH4, ammonium.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:48):**  So this takes time.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  So the release is the decomposition.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:54):**  It takes time.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:55):**  It doesn't immediately make nitrogen available from an organic compound available to the  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  plants.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  So there is not an immediate loss and that percentage is lower because it builds carbon,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  it retains carbon, nitrogen is trapped more.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  The problem with the amendments of organic amendments is you also may have CH4, methane  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:18):**  emission associated to that application, which is about 25 times more powerful than CO2.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  But overall, no, synthetic fertilizer are the ones that they use the most obviously,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  and they are the greatest.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  But there is a new approach to slow release fertilizer.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  So basically they have shown to, they're still synthetic, the cost is still very high, but  
**[0:34:44-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  it does reduce N2O emissions because it slowly releases the amount of mineral nitrogen that  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:52):**  could be volatilized.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  And the other aspect of N2O emissions and fertilizer is that has to be in a conditions  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  that creates denitrification.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  So back to N2, you know, in the form, and that occurs when there is a flooding conditions,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  right, when there is lack of oxygen.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  And normally when you add organic compounds, that doesn't happen.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:20):**  You are back on the healthy side of having greater porosity, better conditions in general.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  So synthetic fertilizer are certainly the ones emitting the most.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  But it's not even a natural, a cover crop will have emissions, not as high obviously  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  as a fertilizer, but it's a natural process.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:43):**  Where would a crop be in terms of net nitrogen loss?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  If I planted corn year after year in the same place and I wasn't doing tillage and I had,  
**[0:35:54-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  let's say, had really good soils, would I need to add nitrogen or could I get that system  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  to function without nitrogen addition if I left all that biomass?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:08):**  Very good question.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  It goes back on the temporal time and on the first year.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  So I, you may have seen in some of my research by scaling and understanding this spatial  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  variation as identifying that each field as like a farmer will know, but not all the farmers  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  know that and can be scaled, that there are parts of the field that are much better, you  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  know, because they have deeper soil, like deeper volume.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:38):**  And so those, then it becomes back to the virtuous cycle where you have greater biomass,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:46):**  greater roots, greater decompositions, and you do accumulate that.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  The mineralization, so an organic, fully, let's say, in this way will be an organic  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  source of management.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  If it's managed correctly, it could compensate, but you may not have the same level of yields.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  The yield could have a penalty in the beginning.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  In the first years, it may not be sufficiently to compensate what you were used to.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  So we also seen at this long-term study that organic systems, and in our case, it was only  
**[0:37:26-0:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  cover crop and no tillage, it could come close to the yields of the mineralization just because  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  it isn't just about all nitrogen.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:39):**  They held more water and the conventional tillage ran out of water much quicker.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  Okay, so it's really a system.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:47):**  So to answer your question, immediately, no, long-term, certainly can.  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:53):**  But the yields are not obviously the 600 bushels, but they can easily get to the level of average  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  yields, which will bring the benefits of trade-off analysis of the cost of doing things.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  Farmers need to understand that, and they do, for sure, not necessarily all of them,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  but profit is also obtained by spending less investing.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:21):**  So it's not, unfortunately, nitrogen is a cheap and economic source of insurance as  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  a thing.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  It costs significantly lower to put an extra pound compared to, it's basically 50 cents  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  versus $4 a bushel that you could get from the addition.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  And that's again, back onto the trade-offs.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  Are we serious about accumulating carbon and using it carbon to store and offset the emissions  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  and so on versus the profit?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:52):**  I'm always of the idea that we need to be able to reward farmers for what they do in  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  long-term sustainability, basically keep carbon there and using more sustainable management,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:06):**  which is to reduce the amount of fertilizer.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  The reduced amount of fertilizer, it's very interesting, back to the space of variation,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  there are parts of the fields shouldn't even be cultivated with the same crop, but they  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:16):**  are even cultivated with the same management.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  So a corn crop that yields 100 bushels either on the edge of the field or on some poor conditions,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  that receives 200 pounds per acre on average depending on, let's say, typical.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:34):**  And that's unacceptable because you're really emitting much more.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  So converting those areas into more perennial and legumes, then you will build the soil  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:45):**  and the system to be able to mineralize that.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  Given some of the work you do with SIBO and in just some of the academic work you've done,  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  it seems like a lot of the focus is on carbon emissions.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:59):**  But if you have nitrogen oxide, which is worse at the end of the day, shouldn't there also  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  be some concern about containing nitrogen within the system?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  And is nitrogen the same as carbon?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:14):**  If you reach that carbon saturation point in the soil where it's at equilibrium, could  
**[0:40:18-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  nitrogen be the same in a natural system where everything that's being used is being stored  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  in the soil, either in the biomass or in the living microbial biomass in the soil?  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  Yes, very good.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  The first question, Diego, that's not necessarily, when we say carbon emissions, everything is  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  converted into CO2 equivalent.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  So everybody knows that the greatest emissions come from N2O.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  And we aim to reduce N2O emissions, but there are a drag of CO2 equivalent.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  So I am working on a way to basically create carbon credits by reducing, but better managing  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  It comes as a benefit to the atmosphere because you reduce the CO2 equivalent from nitrogen.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  Nitrogen is critical also because people have talked enough, but it's kind of lost now in  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  terms of benefits from water quality is a critical aspect of nitrogen.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  The system by definition in soils is a leaking system.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  So nitrates, because of the way the molecule has this negative charge, they're basically  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40):**  very mobile.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  So the point of saturation is really hard to get because you get a flush and it very  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  goes down to the next layer and so on.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  So the nitrogen in general, it's never on a fully positive accumulation because it's  
**[0:41:58-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  used by the plants is denitrify, it's volatilized, but most of it is basically lost as nitrate  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  reaching.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  And in addition, some will be surface runoff, that soil is taken with that.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  But a third or more, so back to the spatial variation in the areas of low nitrogen use  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:23):**  efficiency, these areas will take only 40 to 50% at the most of what it was applied.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  So I bring this example often when I talk to growers, it says, imagine you buy this  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  pound, a hundred pound bag, and you dump the first 50 in the parking lot, and then you  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:42):**  go back to your field and you apply.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  Why did you apply so much more on these areas?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  Well, it's just an example.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  I don't necessarily know, but now technology would eventually possibly in the end of the  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  talk, we could go on the future of how data and digital technologies could help.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  But we have a very good knowledge of where these low areas in a field are.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  And so you could now have a hundred percent efficiency by putting 50% of the amount because  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  the yield is basically that plant is small and only requires half of what it was demanding  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  initially.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  So again, the point is saturation.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:26):**  It's like impossible because of an open container.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  It doesn't have a bucket at the end.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:34):**  Carbon doesn't move, it's tight and it reaches, it's like you can only put so much around  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:38):**  it.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:39):**  Then with nitrates, because of the nature in the leaky system, they're lost as nitrate  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:45):**  reaching.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  So that's very difficult to manage just because of that.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  In addition, you may notice that there's still a tendency for various reasons.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:57):**  I'm not here to judge, but the majority of the application of fertilizer, it's done at  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  the end of the season without even knowing what you're going to basically get in the  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  year.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  So obviously for reason of logistics, reason of possible lower prices and in the middle  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  of the summer, you may very well be sure, but they don't necessarily go back.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  And so what do they do?  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:25):**  They kind of compensate with a large amount in the beginning.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  That's changing and they're doing all the way to now variable rates of application where  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  one area gets one amount and another gets a different amount.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  So there's quite a bit of improvements both in science of understanding the dynamics,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  detecting these deficiencies, but there's a combination of a culture of managing maybe  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  more traditionally, but that's very split.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:57):**  There are lots of progressive farmers.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  And so as a suggestion in general, imagine nitrogen to be like your food.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  You don't just stack up and cook a huge amount.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  You will be eating it through time.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  You won't be eating it all at once.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  So what's the point of cooking 10 steaks when you can only eat one, then the rest is thrown  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:19):**  away because you will be spoiled, right?  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  That's the equivalent of the leachate.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  And so if you apply the nitrogen when it's needed, which is difficult because synchronizing  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  supply and demand is a conflict.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:33):**  Sometimes you cannot go back in the field, but there are times when you can and there  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  is a limit when you can.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  There are alternatives with high boys and more describing obviously a Midwest based  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:44):**  in vegetables.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  It's very important to, you know, feed with more of a spoon type of approach than having  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  all the ones because a fraction of that will be lost through water.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  So even in the healthiest or best managed system, you're going to be needing to add  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:02):**  some because it just is a leaky system.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:05):**  There are pores.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  There are macro pores and water comes down.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  It takes you don't lose it just to give you an idea.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:12):**  How long will it take for me to lose?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  You know what I put in?  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  It's usually nitrates are never lost in the season.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:19):**  They're always lost when the plants are not there to be taken out.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:23):**  So what's good about growing vegetable?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  You do have nitrogen that if you have another crop coming in, there is leftovers that can  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  be used.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  The difficulties, remember because of the nature of leaching, some of these nitrates  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  are not in the surface.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  They're now a little bit deeper, quite a bit deeper.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:46):**  Now they are on the second foot of soil.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  So you could prevent some of it when you know deeper roots.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:53):**  So again, the leaching could be up to 50%, but you know, high yielding crop can be as  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  low as 15%.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  What about in crop rotation?  
**[0:47:04-0:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:04):**  So you know, we've talked to cover crops legumes.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:07):**  A legume when it's out of the field, that nitrogen that it's accumulated in its body,  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:13):**  it's in roots, that's not going to be instantly available.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17):**  Do you get a slower, I'll say leaching into the soil as those, that biomass breaks down  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  or do you experience that flush like you do with a chemical fertilizer where eventually  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:31):**  it's all going to come loose?  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  No, it's the first aspect you introduced.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  The cover crops and legumes that they are either left on the surface or put in the beginning,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:46):**  I mean the top layers, few inches, takes time to decompose.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  They need to have the decomposition time.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  There is never a flush under a green manure, sorts of things versus the fertilizer.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  Why do we have fertilizer in the first place?  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  Because they provide food when you need it.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  The nitrates are already in the form.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  Those legumes don't have, they're still organic.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  They don't have nitrates immediately.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  They still have to get out of the organic compounds that they are tied in to be able  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  to be.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:22):**  So you have to go through that process, which is a tricky business because it takes time  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  and you release, you have to have a plant using it.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:31):**  I've done a study just to compare that sometimes excessive amount of manures don't get you  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:38):**  off the hook.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  They will still lose nitrates because in the off season when plants continue to mineralize,  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  then there are no crops to be taken up and it will still lose.  
**[0:48:50-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  So it's again, this lag of time of decomposition that allows the reduction in flushes of nitrates  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  going down.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  Fertilizer in comparison, you can have 60 to 100 parts per million, very huge, 10% is  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  allowed.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  Okay, immediately.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:12):**  When do we see that now?  
**[0:49:14-0:49:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  When we collect water in lysimeters, April, May in the environment that I'm used to in  
**[0:49:21-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:21):**  the Midwest, the soil has been fully saturated with water over winter.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  You grew up in East Coast, so there is, you know, the amount of was plenty of snow, the  
**[0:49:32-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  soil closed.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  Guess what?  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  First sampling we get in the beginning of, you know, when the soil is done, very much  
**[0:49:40-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:40):**  a large component, large nitrates.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  And then the ones that is used, that is used efficiently during the season, then the plants  
**[0:49:49-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:49):**  basically it's like eating when they need it and sneaking only lower is basically lost  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  to that.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  But a green manure is much more sustainable way of applying nitrogen in a form, but there  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  is a price of the land of not being available.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  So this is really the reasoning behind one of those NRCS principles of always keep a  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  living root in the soil as long as possible is obviously it's feeding the soil through  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:20):**  root exudates, but it's also soaking up any nitrogen that might otherwise be lost.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:26):**  Like you'd never want that soil sitting there.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  So in a leaky system with a leaky molecule, you always want something they're trying to  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:33):**  catch it so it doesn't have the chance to squeeze away.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  Spot on.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  Soils wants company, soil is designed to have plants, plants use what is produced by the  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:45):**  soil and that's exactly the way you should be managed.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:49):**  I'm pushing Ego for some concept that farmers should be rewarded for the numbers of green  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:55):**  surface they have over their soil.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:58):**  You know, some obviously you will say, well, the Midwest, you know, big chunk of time is  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  white.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  You know, the cover crop underneath, you know, that food that's considered basically living  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:10):**  organisms.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  And so rotation, we initially meant that, you know, touched upon the possibility of  
**[0:51:16-0:51:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  having such a beautiful diversity of individuals or microbes.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:24):**  And that's extremely, extremely important to be able to have that.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:31):**  Can you elaborate on that on a temperate climate standpoint?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  I mean, obviously we don't have that problem here in California, but in areas where you  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  get winter, where you get snow, I think a lot of people take it for granted.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:42):**  Well, the ground's frozen, the snow's covering it.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  I don't need a living cover.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  What cover crops would be beneficial to have in the ground under that snow cap and why  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:54):**  is that beneficial and how does that play out over the season from the fall through  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  the freeze to the thaw?  
**[0:52:01-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  Very good.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  I'm hoping we will get there because if you know this so far, we have not mentioned one  
**[0:52:07-0:52:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:07):**  word of a possibility of continuing to degrade the land, which is erosion, soil erosion.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  So if you retain the residues and you have those roots as the cement that they keep the  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:22):**  particle, doesn't matter.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  You got snow, the snow blows, but not everything else.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  Right?  
**[0:52:28-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:28):**  So the first benefit of keeping the soil green in terms of having the cover is to protect  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  from rain erosion and wind erosion.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  Second, remember that wheat, winter wheat resists to a temperature of minus 17 Celsius.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  That's roughly minus 30 Fahrenheit or so.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  That's that.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  So when the snow keeps it at a microclimate close to zero, the plant kind of goes dormant  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  for a little bit, but when the snow and some places, especially now in these more recent  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:07):**  years, the soil is not fully covered by the snow all the time.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  There is a melting.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:12):**  And so there is basically life coming back to me and you know, very, very slow situation,  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:19):**  but the first immediate benefit is keeping the soil cover and protecting from erosion.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:25):**  The next thing is as soon as life comes back in the early spring, then the plant is already  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:31):**  there.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  The roots are there.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  They're ready to go.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:34):**  Why?  
**[0:53:35-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:35):**  It gets warmer and they have water.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  So the next thing, if you're interested in seeing the plant growing, it'll grow fast,  
**[0:53:43-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  because of the initial warming temperature and the possibility of using that water, you  
**[0:53:49-0:53:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  know, right there to be able to allow that to.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:56):**  Now what's interesting is because of this situation of, if you're not able to put a  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:02):**  cover crop at the right time, why would you not be able to do that?  
**[0:54:07-0:54:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:07):**  Soil is still wet.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  You know, it's just, you really could be in the fall.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:12):**  You have a seed amount.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:14):**  So one more recent is called interseeding.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  Okay.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:20):**  So interseeding at D3, D6 when the common plant has three colored leaves.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  So it's about this tall.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:28):**  You can basically plant the cover crop.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  We showed there is two studies that I actually recently published here with a project with  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  a colleague of mine, Karen Renner.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  Can cover crops be able to not compete?  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:44):**  Basically doesn't affect, because corn has already gone in its own way.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  Why would not?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  Because it starts covering them.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:52):**  But they're alive.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:53):**  They get some light coming through.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  And so when you harvest, you have a beautiful green crop that stays over winter and stays  
**[0:55:03-0:55:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  basically.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:04):**  You reduce the patchiness when you go in winter because of the variability in soil water and  
**[0:55:13-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  soil profile and temperature and texture.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  What I mean by patchiness, one area is very well established and another area wouldn't  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:22):**  come out.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  But if it's planted at a proper time during interseeding, then you will have a better  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:28):**  stand, a better possibility of getting that.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:33):**  So that's an improvement on having interseeding, which benefits back to the possibility of  
**[0:55:38-0:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:38):**  having this diversity of roots.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:41):**  You have to be in a very dry condition, obviously.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:44):**  If you talk about having cover crops or interseeding more in a Mediterranean climate, then it's  
**[0:55:49-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  not a popular thing to do because they would use water.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  So it depends.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:54):**  California is very similar in a way.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  But if it is done with the concept of possibility of building carbon retaining water, even the  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  rainfall that occurs, it allows better infiltration and less runoff because the intensity of the  
**[0:56:12-0:56:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  rain, it's reduced.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:14):**  Imagine heavy rain hitting the soil with nothing on it and heavy rain hitting the leaves.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  And then slowly the droplets come in and you have a significant reduced runoff if you have  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  a cover on your soil.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:28):**  And so that's another benefit.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:31):**  This means, I'm usually with my students, we write diagrams and we see my message here  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:38):**  is there is one size fits all.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  But I heard that this, that, this, it's just never be, you have to be surprised all the  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  time how things, yes, it's one way, but there is this other component that pulls you back.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  So it's a system.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  It really is.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:57):**  It's a system of feedback and dynamics that everything that I pretty much talked about  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:04):**  with you.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  And I really compliment you with such a deep knowledge of putting the system together yourself  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:12):**  to understand what, how basically the soil plant atmosphere behaves across different  
**[0:57:17-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:17):**  spaces and conditions.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:20):**  And I appreciate that.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  And I think that's really good context for people to think about in this case.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  One big thing you see a lot now in the veg world is interplanting multiple crops planted  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:31):**  in the same space.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  One negative to that, I mean, well, you mentioned if water's scarce, that's obviously one.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  If it affects harvesting, that can be a problem.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  But let's say those aren't problems.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:45):**  Do you think you get yield sacrifices or do you get a equal or potentially better yield  
**[0:57:50-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  out of both crops given that they're more crops and less space, they're sharing water,  
**[0:57:56-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  they're sharing nutrients?  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  So again, you said the right thing.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:01):**  It depends on the context.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:03):**  If we go in southern Spain or southern Italy and again, southern California, where you  
**[0:58:08-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:08):**  wish to have additional water naturally, then every drop is critical and should be prioritized  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  to what you basically trying to.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:20):**  But if you have a possibility to irrigate and you build now, I see the same thing as  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  before.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:27):**  You're building a system that would build carbon and will retain the positivity of building  
**[0:58:34-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:34):**  the, holding more water.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  And so in that case, you would be, it would be beneficial for everything that we just  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  said.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  In the case of, you know, lack of rainfall, then the soil needs to be covered with some  
**[0:58:51-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:51):**  other ways, whether it's mulch or residues, because you want to prevent soil evaporation.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  Okay.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:58):**  So when you see the world of ET in valve for transpiration, it's like the blanket.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:05):**  If whatever you don't lose from soil evaporation, our goal is to basically have water go through  
**[0:59:11-0:59:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  the plant as maximizing transpiration, maximizing the water use through, because with the water  
**[0:59:18-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:18):**  you take, basically you keep the turgor in the cell, you take the nutrients and you taking  
**[0:59:26-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  water away from soil evaporation.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:28):**  And so that's a balance that in the model that I developed, that that's balanced between  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  the soil surface wetness.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:38):**  You know, wetness, meaning if it is wet on the surface, transpiration is reduced.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  There is a microclimate, you know, compared then if the soil is dry, because if the soil  
**[0:59:50-0:59:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:50):**  is dry, it creates a sensible heat, like, you know, feeling really hot and additional  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:57):**  feedback to water stress to the plant.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:00):**  So that benefit of having another plant, I can't argue against not having water and having  
**[1:00:07-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  another plant is like not necessarily the way you want to do it.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  If you depend on rainfall, that doesn't come.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  But again, keeping the soil covered, it will benefit.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  In areas where you manage it, you do want to have, because of the benefits of the microbial  
**[1:00:24-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:24):**  and the biology, not to underestimate.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  And on the long term effects of remember, retaining those residues, remember that you  
**[1:00:32-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  are in debt from your saturation.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  And as much you can bring that, the more you bring that, think of that, and when you increase  
**[1:00:40-1:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:40):**  carbon, you have another equivalent bucket, you increase water.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:44):**  So see it that way.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  The more carbon, the more stability you will increase the yield facing difficult conditions.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:53):**  In terms of, you know, dipping into that carbon jar and using up some of that carbon, no-till  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:00):**  is talked about as a way to stop that and slow that down.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:04):**  But no-till is kind of this umbrella, it's a sliding scale in terms of what that is.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  And some people, you know, they get really nuanced in terms of, you know, literally nothing  
**[1:01:14-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:14):**  to some people, you know, vertical tillage might count as no-till.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  Where does tillage become a problem?  
**[1:01:23-1:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:23):**  Is it depth?  
**[1:01:24-1:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:24):**  Is it a certain amount?  
**[1:01:26-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:26):**  Where if we are in a human system, right?  
**[1:01:28-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  Like we need a certain amount of production, we have to manage these things.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  Certain things can't happen using kind of idealistic systems.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  Is there an amount of tillage that's kind of within that no-till regime that is probably  
**[1:01:45-1:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:45):**  okay, but if you start really going beyond that, that's when major damage starts to happen?  
**[1:01:50-1:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:50):**  Yes, very good point.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:52):**  One just one thing that I like the audience to listen and to understand, you use the word  
**[1:01:58-1:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  we use carbon.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:00):**  It's more we lose carbon, you know, because plants don't use it, carbon from the soil.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:05):**  We lose it in terms of basically CO2 as a mechanism of respiration.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  We accumulate carbon in the soil by bringing it in, and we lose it from CO2 emitted.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  So roots don't use carbon, they put carbon into the soil.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:22):**  And the microbes eat on that.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:24):**  And at some point, if we still have time, it's important to explain the level of the  
**[1:02:29-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  different components of carbon.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:31):**  You know, how, why is it different, you know, the sugar, the lignin and cellulose and so  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  on.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:37):**  Cellulose.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  So yes, the tillage is tricky.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:41):**  There is a mechanism that should be avoided, which what we call inversion tillage, flipping  
**[1:02:50-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:50):**  the whole layer, moldboard plow.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  The old plowing.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:55):**  What does plowing do?  
**[1:02:57-1:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:57):**  Plowing effective effects basically creates a tillage pan.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:05):**  Basically I cost the patient like a restricting layer by pushing and you will have this to  
**[1:03:11-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:11):**  have a much lower conductivity of water.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  So the layer is much more compacted.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  Okay, so this clay pan or tillage pan, and then you flip it.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:23):**  What do you bring in the most active?  
**[1:03:25-1:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:25):**  Getting living large and accumulating.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:28):**  You bring it upside down, you put it to the oxygen.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:31):**  So gets basically immediately lost everything that you had.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  So tillage unfortunately has this difficult thing, which again, we cannot judge.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:42):**  It depends on the goal.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  It's almost, you know, objective function is, but I mean, okay, how are you going to  
**[1:03:49-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  grow a potato if you don't till?  
**[1:03:51-1:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  Right.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:52):**  And we like potatoes.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  Yeah, of course we like potatoes.  
**[1:03:55-1:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:55):**  So can we mitigate that component of doing that?  
**[1:03:57-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:57):**  Why do we grow, where do we grow potatoes?  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  We tend to grow potatoes in sandy soils where there is much less structure to start with.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  So one thing about me is that I'm not, I'm above the parts in describing this system.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  So no one can be offended if I say, no tillage, you do one tillage, you lose pretty much a  
**[1:04:16-1:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:16):**  lot of what you have already accumulated because you just play.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:20):**  When you do the surface, and like you said, you know, you scrape the surface, you do a  
**[1:04:24-1:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  little bit of that.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:25):**  If it is non-inversion tillage, it is sometimes necessary, for example, in all the organic  
**[1:04:32-1:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:32):**  system where you basically pull the weeds.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:35):**  Is that, there are so many studies comparing, is that scraping the surface to remove that  
**[1:04:42-1:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:42):**  weed and the weed being on the soil that brings carbon better than spraying it with an herbicide  
**[1:04:48-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:48):**  that costs you an arm and a leg in carbon and energy to spray it where you do no tillage.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  And so a full no tillage is the ideal situation where basically rotations, you can still do  
**[1:05:02-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  no tillage in controlling the weeds by having cover crops, you know, and, but there are,  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:08):**  there are difficulties, you still have to dry them down, you know, you have to kill  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  them and so you use chemical herbicide and you're ready to a level of complexity that  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:17):**  you don't belong already into a certified, you know, kind of organic system.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  So back to your question, if you scrape that, what do you, what are you basically doing?  
**[1:05:27-1:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  You are losing that carbon you accumulated, but only from that layer.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:32):**  You haven't touched this part.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:34):**  The part below that remains, the aggregate remains the same.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  So when you touch it, you touch it, it's open.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:42):**  You break the aggregates and carbon is emitted as a CO2 because the microbes can access the  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  carbon available and it's a feast.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:52):**  If it is protected inside, they stay in there, they don't leave, they eat and poop, you know,  
**[1:05:58-1:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:58):**  and expel carbon in the aggregate and the aggregates are much closer.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:02):**  So that glue keeps growing and becomes, if you scrape that, fires enemies, you want to  
**[1:06:08-1:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:08):**  get rid of weeds, then the damage is for those.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:10):**  You lose, you change bulk density, you change that percent of carbon and we can quantify  
**[1:06:15-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:15):**  exactly how much carbon you have emitted in the atmosphere versus flipping the whole marble  
**[1:06:21-1:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  plough, you know, you mix the hell out of that and then you lose a large amount.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:27):**  But again, are you, you know, potatoes have to be done this way, but there are lots of  
**[1:06:32-1:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:32):**  other novel techniques of be able to managing potatoes in a way that could accumulate more  
**[1:06:40-1:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:40):**  carbon.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:41):**  Yeah, it's a longer rotation where your potatoes and then your cover crops for a few years  
**[1:06:46-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:46):**  build that carbon back up and then...  
**[1:06:48-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  Exactly, and you maintain, that's exactly right.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  No potatoes after potatoes, so you go back to your, you can have your hairy vetch and  
**[1:06:56-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  clover as cover crop right away.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:58):**  You have corn and soybeans and you bring back to the system what you did.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  Then because, because we have to eat potatoes, there's no question on their bounties and  
**[1:07:09-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:09):**  the value and fibers and all the positive aspects of that.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  Well let's look at what you were talking about previously, you know, different forms of carbon.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:17):**  So people listening to this, they think of carbon in the soil, you have a few things.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:21):**  You have a living root, you have the exudates coming out of that root, you have the microbes  
**[1:07:26-1:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:26):**  in the soil that have carbon in their bodies, and then you have previous plant material  
**[1:07:31-1:07:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:31):**  that's left in the soil.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:32):**  So all these different forms of carbon.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:36):**  When you talk about that, how do you explain this to people and how do you value these  
**[1:07:41-1:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:41):**  in the system?  
**[1:07:42-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:42):**  Yes, so I try to keep simple because it's a complex matter and you have to start separating  
**[1:07:51-1:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  what we call as organic matter.  
**[1:07:54-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:54):**  One is fresh organic matter and one is soil organic matter.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  When you say the fresh is in the soil, yes, but it's a fresh organic matter are the roots,  
**[1:08:04-1:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04):**  all the residues, so more plant-based related.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:07):**  Manure, fresh organic, you know, you put it from fresh that is quickly decomposed.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  Now that fresh organic matter has different pools and these pools are just like, what  
**[1:08:20-1:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:20):**  would you think?  
**[1:08:21-1:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:21):**  I mean, I don't know about, if I can think of a good example, but if you were to eat  
**[1:08:26-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:26):**  something and you know it wouldn't be bad for you, most of us probably would choose  
**[1:08:30-1:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  dessert to eat first.  
**[1:08:33-1:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:33):**  Because so there is the first thing that the microbeats are sugar.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:37):**  So they eat the sugars, the carbohydrates, and that's very labile, really quick to decompose.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:42):**  They eat it, poop, expel.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:44):**  Then they go on the chewy stuff, the fiber, like weed, you know, like more of it.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:49):**  And that's the cellulose and amicellulose, the component of, you know, people are more  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:55):**  familiar with those concepts in the trees and the park and so on.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:59):**  Then lignin, much harder and chewy, and that's still the roots.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  And so a leaf, how long does it take for a leaf in the fall to decompose?  
**[1:09:09-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:09):**  I mean, you look at it, it's gone just about, you know, a few months because it's, how much  
**[1:09:13-1:09:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  lignin does it have?  
**[1:09:15-1:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:15):**  Very little compared, it's much more soft and versus, you know, a piece of wood that  
**[1:09:20-1:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:20):**  has a deceiving amount of, you know, lignin.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:24):**  And the fresh organic matter, so it's the first thing and the things that those microbes,  
**[1:09:31-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:31):**  they become the organic carbon and the organic carbon has three different pools.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  We call it pools again as a qualitative description.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  A labile pool, very quick turnaround, less than six months to a year.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  It depends really on the type of where the soil is and climate and everything, but very  
**[1:09:53-1:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  short dynamics.  
**[1:09:55-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:55):**  Then you have the intermediate or slow pool, that's what we wish to have the most.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  The eumic form, things that stays and becomes that colloidal material, black looking stuff,  
**[1:10:09-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:09):**  the good soil organic carbon.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  Biochar for example, stays, it's a lot of all the other stuff is gone, you maintain  
**[1:10:17-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:17):**  it in the soil.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  Very good amendment.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:20):**  But biochar is almost also towards more resistant.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  Then you've got a resistant or passive as you want to call, those are the ones that  
**[1:10:28-1:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:28):**  we use for carbon dating.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:30):**  You know, you can go back to the Romans time and you know where that stone is because there's  
**[1:10:36-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:36):**  carbon that will last for so long.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  But normally those are in the century old type of dynamics to decompose that.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:45):**  Each of them, every time it decomposes, releases CO2, it goes into the atmosphere.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:51):**  So the first component, 16% of the first pool immediately when decomposed, CO2.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:57):**  Organic matter from this labile, some of it is accumulated and goes into the slow pool.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:03):**  That one gets decomposes much slower over a longer period of time, goes to CO2 and each  
**[1:11:09-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:09):**  of them.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  So it's basically this, if you imagine almost this six kind of circle, three above fresh  
**[1:11:15-1:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:15):**  organic matter, you know, labile, the carbohydrates, amicelulose, cellulose, lignin, labile pool,  
**[1:11:26-1:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:26):**  intermediate pool, humus, slope and resistance.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:31):**  For somebody, you know, if we want that intermediate pool, how do you get that into the soil?  
**[1:11:35-1:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:35):**  How do you build that up?  
**[1:11:36-1:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:36):**  If you wanted to turn that number up in your soil, what are ways somebody would do that?  
**[1:11:42-1:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:42):**  You add carbon, you add residues, you add roots.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:46):**  It cannot be produced by itself.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:49):**  It has to come from outside.  
**[1:11:51-1:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:51):**  It has to come from living organisms.  
**[1:11:53-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:53):**  It comes from fresh.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  Oh, those three pools above are connected to the one below.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:57):**  Those are the ones that funnel into that.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:00):**  So how do you accumulate that?  
**[1:12:01-1:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:01):**  By putting mulch, by putting manure, by putting.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:05):**  So organic matter per se, like I said, is 60% carbon.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  So it's, but that gets burned quickly because it's the fresh organic matter.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:15):**  So a big chunk of that is lost.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  But one thing is when you do a soil sampling and you get a big large number in a mineral  
**[1:12:23-1:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  soils, you have got a piece of fresh organic matter somehow.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:29):**  Something is not, you know, it cannot be a 12, 13% organic matter converted into 6 or  
**[1:12:39-1:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:39):**  7% organic carbon in a very short time, knowing what your equilibrium is and where you are  
**[1:12:45-1:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:45):**  in the rotation if you are in a grazing system.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:49):**  So there is that, it doesn't mean that, oh, I didn't see anything or there was a business  
**[1:12:53-1:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:53):**  there.  
**[1:12:54-1:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:54):**  It's very, you know, fine decomposition, but that will eventually be lost.  
**[1:12:59-1:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:59):**  That's what I'm saying.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:00):**  It looks there, but it's going to be lost.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:02):**  One that stays is the organic carbon.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:04):**  And if you look at the literature and the sampling over time for all this, when you  
**[1:13:09-1:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  analyze for organic carbon, it changes very little.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:12):**  It could change a lot if you add, basically add more carbon in the form of fresh organic  
**[1:13:21-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:21):**  matter roots.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  So that fresh organic matter under the soil, microbes start to eat it and that's how it  
**[1:13:29-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  ends up in that intermediate pool.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  Eventually it's in those bodies of those organisms.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:33):**  Some is emitted, you can prevent that.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:36):**  Some is lost as part of the decomposition.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:38):**  So roughly three tons of in a maize system, you know, you return five, it is not yield.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  You could return five tons, 3.5 tons of lost for CO2, un-preventable, but you have accumulated  
**[1:13:51-1:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:51):**  one ton.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:52):**  Then the next year, don't touch, you keep doing good yield.  
**[1:13:56-1:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:56):**  You keep bringing that.  
**[1:13:57-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:57):**  That's another ton.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  That's so, but when you had the ton out of a volume, if you want to calculate the stock,  
**[1:14:06-1:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:06):**  Diego is you have an organic percent, which is whatever number you have, the depth that  
**[1:14:12-1:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  you're using and you have bulk density.  
**[1:14:14-1:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:14):**  What's the density of the soil, you know, the weight of the soils over the volume.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:20):**  And so when you multiply the percent carbon with the bulk density, you have the volume  
**[1:14:26-1:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:26):**  of the soil percent of that.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:28):**  So an example, I mean, just by doing it in my mind, there are roughly, you know, 25,000  
**[1:14:34-1:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  kilograms in 1.3% bulk density for 15 centimeters.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:41):**  And that's basically the stock.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:43):**  So you add one ton, 24 is 0.1%.  
**[1:14:46-1:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:46):**  There's very little increase, but it's going up.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:49):**  But as soon as you open that jar, it's no longer three of the decomposition becomes  
**[1:14:55-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  four or five because you're adding these layers that you slowly open by mixing that soil with  
**[1:15:02-1:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  the tillage.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:03):**  We covered a lot of ground.  
**[1:15:05-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:05):**  I hope it was clear, but...  
**[1:15:06-1:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:06):**  No, no, it's good.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:08):**  And that's even got me thinking.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:09):**  I mean, is above ground and below ground decomposition of carbon equal?  
**[1:15:15-1:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:15):**  So above ground, like the dry biomass, most of that just goes away into the sky when it  
**[1:15:21-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:21):**  breaks down.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  When you go underground, if you look at the dry biomass of the roots, does that break  
**[1:15:27-1:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  down and volatilize as much as above ground?  
**[1:15:31-1:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:31):**  Because what I'm getting at, would you rather be putting 100 units on soil surface or 100  
**[1:15:38-1:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:38):**  units below soil surface if you want to keep as much carbon in the soil?  
**[1:15:42-1:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:42):**  Very, very good question.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:46):**  If you put it on the surface, it won't decompose as fast.  
**[1:15:50-1:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:50):**  So that carbon stays there.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:52):**  It can be blown out, you know, with wind and everything.  
**[1:15:55-1:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:55):**  But if it stays, Argentina is a perfect example.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:59):**  You go to a field in Argentina and you are walking on a mattress of residues.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:06):**  You don't see the soil.  
**[1:16:07-1:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:07):**  I mean, there's this much amount of beautiful, small, finely broken soybean and corn stalks  
**[1:16:16-1:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:16):**  residues.  
**[1:16:18-1:16:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:18):**  That's the true carbon that we are not putting in the atmosphere.  
**[1:16:21-1:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:21):**  That stays there for a long time.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:23):**  What happens eventually if you don't want it to be lost, if it's lost, it just goes  
**[1:16:28-1:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:28):**  to another place.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:30):**  So to answer your question, you very, very correctly pointed out what happens if you  
**[1:16:34-1:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34):**  put it in the soil.  
**[1:16:36-1:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:36):**  You bring the organic matter in the soil higher, you add in carbon, but there is a fraction  
**[1:16:43-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:43):**  of that that's lost to CO2.  
**[1:16:46-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:46):**  So it's a balance.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  If you keep it on the surface, it doesn't get decomposed.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:51):**  That's pure carbon.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  40 to 50 percent roughly of that amount of biomass is carbon stored there.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  You put it in there, 60 percent of that goes to CO2.  
**[1:17:03-1:17:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:03):**  So 40 percent stays.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:05):**  In the soil.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  In the soil.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:07):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  So but up there it's nearly 100 percent because there are no microbes.  
**[1:17:13-1:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  Slowly, yeah, microbes will.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:14):**  So there is normally this is actually even we do it in the model that that top mulch  
**[1:17:25-1:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:25):**  works its way through and that's why the top soil always has higher organic matter and  
**[1:17:32-1:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  this residue never really reach much deeper except for the rooting system that over time  
**[1:17:40-1:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:40):**  if they are well grown and established you can have root system in corn going down three  
**[1:17:48-1:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:48):**  feet, four feet down.  
**[1:17:50-1:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:50):**  Alpha is nearly five meters.  
**[1:17:54-1:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:54):**  And so that I don't know if that explains.  
**[1:17:58-1:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:58):**  So if you leave it there.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:59):**  No, it does.  
**[1:18:00-1:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:00):**  But on that thick mat, like one thing I always think is like when you put roots in the soil,  
**[1:18:05-1:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:05):**  you're building soil down, like because the roots are pushing down where you can't go.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:09):**  If you're if you're putting organic matter on top as a mulch, you're building soil up  
**[1:18:13-1:18:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:13):**  because eventually that mulch layer like the soil level rises up.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:16):**  Correct?  
**[1:18:17-1:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:18):**  You building soils, you build.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:19):**  Yeah.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:20):**  You're making a step that is free over time that you slowly it takes very little to lose  
**[1:18:26-1:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:26):**  soil and it takes hundreds of years to build soils.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:31):**  How do you build soils?  
**[1:18:32-1:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:32):**  With exactly the way you said you're basically building this that eventually this you steam  
**[1:18:37-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:37):**  things decompose, you put a seed that will grow, right?  
**[1:18:40-1:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  That's new sorts of because then it gets mixed in and it slowly improves.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:45):**  If you put it there, it's not that you never want to put it in there because roots are  
**[1:18:49-1:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:49):**  there and you want to keep them there and so on.  
**[1:18:51-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:51):**  But some gets decomposed.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  Now it's a rate, it's a balance, how fast you put it out versus how fast you draw your  
**[1:19:01-1:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:01):**  bank account.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:03):**  So the roots get decomposed.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:05):**  When you next year you put more residues and the roots and the yield is getting bigger,  
**[1:19:09-1:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:09):**  those three times when you put four you accumulated one.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:11):**  So the prevention, the CO2 is un-preventable.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  It's this part of the decomposition.  
**[1:19:19-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:19):**  Now but there are thresholds, there's complexities, not always if it is cold, what happens?  
**[1:19:29-1:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  Nothing happens.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:31):**  Means the soils carbon stays like that.  
**[1:19:35-1:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:35):**  Stays like the surface.  
**[1:19:38-1:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:38):**  If it is too wet also it can kind of becomes you know it gets denit, de-95 but there is  
**[1:19:45-1:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:45):**  conditions no good.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:46):**  Next example I can do, tropical soils, desert, how much carbon is in those soils?  
**[1:19:52-1:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:52):**  Man they got rain, they got plenty of vegetation, right?  
**[1:19:56-1:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:56):**  In tropic conditions.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:58):**  Why there's no carbon?  
**[1:20:00-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:00):**  There's no carbon, 0.5, 1% less.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  Acting expedite because of the temperature.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:10):**  So the temperature plays a big role and soil water content plays a big role.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:15):**  And there is an optimum of mineralization, of decompositions of this.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  So cold conditions, the prairie, the midwest and Illinois soils of you know four or five  
**[1:20:28-1:20:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:28):**  percent, three, four percent because they were at 5.5 and they lost it once they tilled.  
**[1:20:35-1:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:35):**  So cold is good, keeps, preserves you, everything is good.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:40):**  Hot turns things down.  
**[1:20:42-1:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:42):**  And so that's also with water content.  
**[1:20:45-1:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:45):**  And so we have functions.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:47):**  Another thing is percent of clay.  
**[1:20:50-1:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:50):**  Percent of clay, clay plays a protection factor.  
**[1:20:54-1:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:54):**  So basically the biogeochemistry, carbon is tied to and it's much more difficult to decompose  
**[1:21:03-1:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:03):**  on a clay particle.  
**[1:21:05-1:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:05):**  Sandy soils, how much carbon is in sandy soils?  
**[1:21:08-1:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:08):**  Significantly lower than clay because in clay it's protected.  
**[1:21:12-1:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:12):**  They've done soil biology 101, maybe 201.  
**[1:21:17-1:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:17):**  It's good.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:18):**  And one thing you mentioned a little while back is one of those intermediate forms of  
**[1:21:22-1:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:22):**  carbon biochar.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:23):**  I've talked to people on the podcast about it.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:27):**  What are your thoughts of it?  
**[1:21:28-1:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:28):**  The theory, you have a chunk of pure carbon, you put it in the soil, it stays there and  
**[1:21:35-1:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:35):**  it stays there for a very long period of time.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:37):**  While it may not be greatly beneficial to the soil, at least it's not going up into  
**[1:21:42-1:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:42):**  the sky.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:43):**  How do you view it?  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  I view it positively in terms of it is carbon.  
**[1:21:49-1:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  It stays there for a hundred years.  
**[1:21:52-1:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:52):**  Terra, Negra in Brazil, these basically beautiful black pieces that you may have already heard  
**[1:21:59-1:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:59):**  about, the results of the pyrolysis and slow temperature.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:03):**  So it's a good carbon.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:05):**  The cost benefit is not my analysis to do, but it's equivalent to say, okay, I'm getting  
**[1:22:16-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:16):**  a lot of free carbon that stays in the soil and it's going to build.  
**[1:22:20-1:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  Does it pay immediately?  
**[1:22:23-1:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:23):**  Not immediately.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:24):**  That's a buildup that you do over time, that you basically prime the system to have this  
**[1:22:30-1:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:30):**  carbon.  
**[1:22:31-1:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:31):**  So it's more of an economic evaluation because there are other forms of possible amendments  
**[1:22:38-1:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:38):**  that you can add.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:39):**  Now, and again, the goal is not to go in the economic analysis, but it is carbon, it is  
**[1:22:45-1:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:45):**  positive and stays there for a long time and does improve.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:49):**  The literature is divided.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  I mean, in terms of saying, because it's there, I think, don't want to judge, but they were  
**[1:22:55-1:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:55):**  seeing, oh, one study, so yield effect increase, another study decline.  
**[1:23:01-1:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:01):**  You can't translate it like that.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:03):**  It depends where they were down and how the weather occur.  
**[1:23:06-1:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:06):**  It wasn't, even if you isolate everything, sometimes studies forget about the dynamics  
**[1:23:11-1:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:11):**  of, you know, consecutive days that was harder versus another.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:15):**  So it's much more complex and most of these studies were maybe not taken as a system approach  
**[1:23:20-1:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:20):**  of integrating all.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:22):**  So that's really difficult to detangle the immediate impact on that.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:27):**  I see it as a more, again, just to bring in what are we adding?  
**[1:23:32-1:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:32):**  We're adding carbon.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:34):**  Yeah.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:35):**  And how do you see that playing into the future of carbon credit markets where, you know,  
**[1:23:40-1:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:40):**  you can take scrap wood, brush, tree trimmings.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:44):**  You could grow trees in a way where you pollard them or coppice them off and burn that off.  
**[1:23:49-1:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:49):**  And then you take what could otherwise sit on the surface in a road or decompose and  
**[1:23:56-1:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:56):**  you can stabilize that and put it underground.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:59):**  Is that a potential avenue for offsetting carbon emissions in the future, you know,  
**[1:24:07-1:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:07):**  with you looking at a lot of carbon modeling?  
**[1:24:10-1:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:10):**  Yes.  
**[1:24:12-1:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:12):**  So that's a very good question.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:14):**  The carbon sequestration, we call it enough, that is critical.  
**[1:24:18-1:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:18):**  And I think farmers need to be rewarded for doing the right thing of keeping carbon in  
**[1:24:23-1:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:23):**  the soil.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24):**  Now is it, it's very difficult to measure carbon in terms of not the measurement, even  
**[1:24:30-1:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:30):**  though, I mean, partially the measurement per se, because some laboratory, we have actually  
**[1:24:35-1:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:35):**  having fun doing comparison of laboratory tests and getting different results from the  
**[1:24:40-1:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:40):**  same soil samples, which, so the level of uncertainty is in a value when you get is  
**[1:24:46-1:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:46):**  pretty large, just from the laboratory, where you sample in one place in the field versus  
**[1:24:53-1:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:53):**  another.  
**[1:24:54-1:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:54):**  So my take on this thing is that, okay, you take a piece of wood and you put it in the  
**[1:24:59-1:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:59):**  soil and you think you have added carbon for what we have talked about it.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:03):**  That thing, yes, it is carbon, but it takes forever to decompose because it's really,  
**[1:25:08-1:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:08):**  you know, just not chewable and it's not immediate to see this, what we call more of a real organic  
**[1:25:17-1:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:17):**  carbon.  
**[1:25:18-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:18):**  So the modeling components goes hand to hand to some of the measurements in two ways.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  First of all, there is a role in remote sensing to be able to identify areas of variations  
**[1:25:29-1:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:29):**  where you could target some of your samples.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:33):**  But I actually believe that the approach, for example, that SIBO has taken in creating  
**[1:25:38-1:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:38):**  what we call regenerative potentials.  
**[1:25:42-1:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:42):**  So we know well how a crop grows pretty well.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:46):**  I mean, to the level of maybe less than five to 10%.  
**[1:25:51-1:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:51):**  And if you're interested, I'll tell you some of the story about the modeling, but five  
**[1:25:54-1:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:54):**  to 10% accuracy in getting that crop.  
**[1:25:58-1:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:58):**  And once you have, that's not even a level of error, that crop is returned and it's returned  
**[1:26:05-1:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:05):**  every single year.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:07):**  It's much more, it's sufficiently safe to use a model with the conditions of what was  
**[1:26:16-1:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:16):**  done in terms of a farmer reporting, I have been doing these practices.  
**[1:26:21-1:26:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:21):**  I have not been till, I start from these conditions of this stall type, which it's pretty well  
**[1:26:27-1:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:27):**  known, and I've grown hairy vetch or rye, or we will know under those conditions because  
**[1:26:34-1:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:34):**  that's known both statistically, observation and modeling.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:39):**  You say, okay, in this environment is roughly three tons, then some is lost.  
**[1:26:44-1:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:44):**  So there is a pretty well mass balance of what is returned.  
**[1:26:48-1:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:48):**  And so my hope is really to be able to get the market of carbon, not just the carbon,  
**[1:26:57-1:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:57):**  but include nitrogen.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:59):**  The abatement from nitrogen is critical because if you're doing so much more on your land  
**[1:27:05-1:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  by reducing the emissions in managing nitrogen better, that needs to be part of that regenerative  
**[1:27:11-1:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:11):**  potential altogether, but it has to be paid year on, every single year.  
**[1:27:17-1:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:17):**  There are other approaches where, okay, it says, okay, you subscribe, we'll see you in  
**[1:27:22-1:27:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:22):**  five years, on 10 years.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:24):**  That's nearly impossible for a farmer to stick to some of the promises or not be able to  
**[1:27:32-1:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:32):**  take the risk of doing things.  
**[1:27:34-1:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:34):**  They're beneficial and they need to be.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  So that's why I'm working with some of the agency to be able to reward them independently,  
**[1:27:41-1:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:41):**  just by doing the right thing.  
**[1:27:43-1:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:43):**  And that's something that hopefully will soon be more considered, including again, one example  
**[1:27:51-1:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:51):**  that I made earlier, removing these unproductive land and be able to have more perennials and  
**[1:27:59-1:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:59):**  a continuous back to the prairies, continue to have this mass balance of carbon accumulating  
**[1:28:04-1:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:04):**  from the atmosphere into the soils and the roots and be rewarded because they've taken  
**[1:28:08-1:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:08):**  some of the land off from production.  
**[1:28:11-1:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:11):**  So the year on versus 10 years where with the dynamics, the change could be small, the  
**[1:28:18-1:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:18):**  credits that you accumulate over 10 years of time, it needs to be more on year on because  
**[1:28:26-1:28:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:26):**  you keep the farmer interested and becomes almost a new way of farming, a carbon farming.  
**[1:28:31-1:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:31):**  You basically are realizing because now is not very high cost.  
**[1:28:36-1:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:36):**  Now I think in cap and trade, California is about $15.75 and then $16 a ton.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  Companies have spoken and big companies saying, oh, we're willing to pay $60 a ton, $100 a  
**[1:28:51-1:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:51):**  ton.  
**[1:28:52-1:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:52):**  $100 a ton when you can accumulate one ton already and you have $100 per acre right there,  
**[1:28:58-1:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:58):**  they don't make a debt now.  
**[1:29:00-1:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:00):**  They're on a very thin margin, especially the more row crop, corn soybeans and they're  
**[1:29:07-1:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:07):**  protected by insurance.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:08):**  Sometimes insurance is given for wrong reasons in terms of some of these areas.  
**[1:29:12-1:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:12):**  Again, it could be a mechanisms of converting the same amount of money to do the right thing  
**[1:29:18-1:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:18):**  of bringing carbon.  
**[1:29:20-1:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:20):**  So what I'm saying is carbon farming is the new way and digital agriculture could help  
**[1:29:25-1:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:25):**  that in terms of accumulating data, using models.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:29):**  That's why obviously I'm biased because I co-founded, you know, Civo Technologies, but  
**[1:29:34-1:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:34):**  the approach of being scalable and identifying the regenerative potential of the soil, this  
**[1:29:40-1:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:40):**  soil versus another soil, it's on a year on, is much more, you know, beneficial to envision  
**[1:29:48-1:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:48):**  this more carbon farming than the very slow kind of sampling after 10 years because farmers  
**[1:29:56-1:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:56):**  will just not play that game.  
**[1:29:59-1:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:59):**  And if you look ahead 10 years, do you think you see a landscape, no pun intended, where  
**[1:30:05-1:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:05):**  farmers have a cash crop, maybe that's corn and soy, maybe that's cattle, maybe that's  
**[1:30:11-1:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:11):**  vegetables and they also have a carbon crop where they're selling off those credits on  
**[1:30:16-1:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:16):**  a year to year basis?  
**[1:30:18-1:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:18):**  You took words out of my mouth.  
**[1:30:20-1:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:20):**  I would exactly say a much more diverse type of cultivation and management of their land,  
**[1:30:30-1:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:30):**  including, like I said, more biodiversity, pollinators, bringing the butterfly back and  
**[1:30:36-1:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:36):**  all the benefits in one section that is poor, the veggie in another area and possibly cut  
**[1:30:42-1:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:42):**  the middleman and do more, the new Amazon of going around and collecting, just things  
**[1:30:48-1:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:48):**  that suddenly this more diverse and the carbon farming will be one.  
**[1:30:54-1:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:54):**  In addition, I see a change in generation, you go with farmers reaching an age, you know,  
**[1:31:02-1:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:02):**  60, 65, on average, new kids coming very much into technology, you know, they use, they  
**[1:31:10-1:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:10):**  attracted to some of the research that I do, flying drones and robotics could play, you  
**[1:31:18-1:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:18):**  know, could be easily envisioned electric robots, you could easily envision a biodegious  
**[1:31:24-1:31:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:24):**  state, you know, this can be energy on your farm to drive some of this.  
**[1:31:30-1:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:30):**  There is all that, that's through all this carbon support in some way, but we have a  
**[1:31:39-1:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:39):**  long way, hopefully it's an exponential curve that goes, you know, faster and, but I am  
**[1:31:45-1:31:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:45):**  certainly optimistic, but, and I work towards that, I work on the side of the farmer when  
**[1:31:52-1:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:52):**  they do the right thing, don't oppose when they don't do the right thing, because it's  
**[1:31:57-1:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:57):**  very important to connect agriculture as a solution, be satisfied with consumers, they  
**[1:32:05-1:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:05):**  are demanding, they want more transparency, but they also need to be able to pay more  
**[1:32:10-1:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:10):**  and no one wants to do that.  
**[1:32:11-1:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:11):**  So there is always this complexity of trade off, no one wants to obviously hear about,  
**[1:32:17-1:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:17):**  you know, taxes on carbon, because it's more of a natural, but somehow whether it's taxes  
**[1:32:22-1:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:22):**  or policy on incentives, they basically, it will be the new way for sure, where things,  
**[1:32:29-1:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:29):**  it will be another layer of financial incomes, in addition to the quality of the products  
**[1:32:35-1:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:35):**  and new technology by verification, you know, blockchain or other systems to quickly verify  
**[1:32:42-1:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:42):**  what goes on and very quick way of selling carbon on the internet, when you can swipe  
**[1:32:48-1:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:48):**  your car, I always upset my mission if I flew to a place and you know, $10 it was trees,  
**[1:32:55-1:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:55):**  now it can be soil carbon.  
**[1:32:58-1:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:58):**  And that's very much doable because what do you do?  
**[1:33:00-1:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:00):**  You improve the quality of agriculture, you improve the food, not just, you know, planting  
**[1:33:05-1:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:05):**  out in the United States with all the respect, which is a very, the proper way to do it also.  
**[1:33:12-1:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:12):**  Yeah.  
**[1:33:13-1:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:13):**  Hey, if you wanted to sequester the most carbon, if you could, like say that was just, that  
**[1:33:19-1:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:19):**  was your goal, you got 1000 acres, you want to sequester as much carbon as you can using  
**[1:33:25-1:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:25):**  agricultural practices on that 1000 acres, what would be your approach?  
**[1:33:29-1:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:29):**  That's a very good question because you didn't give me a timeframe, right?  
**[1:33:34-1:33:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:34):**  And that's the difficult thing is, so first of all, chemical uses just already makes you  
**[1:33:41-1:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:41):**  go on a negative side.  
**[1:33:43-1:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:43):**  But that's the difficulty.  
**[1:33:44-1:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44):**  So I don't necessarily have an immediate answer.  
**[1:33:47-1:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:47):**  I would use the vegetation that is undisturbed to build if you want to do true carbon, that  
**[1:33:55-1:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:55):**  will be something that would allow to sequester, that we already talked about, rotation, no  
**[1:34:01-1:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:01):**  tillage, cover crops, you know, keeping the soil green immediately.  
**[1:34:07-1:34:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:07):**  That's talking by keywords.  
**[1:34:09-1:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:09):**  Those are the four immediate things.  
**[1:34:12-1:34:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:12):**  You want to sequester carbon in terms of that, you can use a lot of the land for solar.  
**[1:34:17-1:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:17):**  That's still kind of carbon.  
**[1:34:19-1:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:19):**  If you see carbon as a offset to the emissions, that's an additional thing.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:27):**  The diversification, diversifying crops, meaning, and I grew up in an area in Italy where there  
**[1:34:33-1:34:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:33):**  were four crops at the same time.  
**[1:34:36-1:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:36):**  Four crops growing, how would that be?  
**[1:34:39-1:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:39):**  Different height, different spatial.  
**[1:34:41-1:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:41):**  So that's a way of basically doing that.  
**[1:34:44-1:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:44):**  There were veggie, there were grapes, there were olives, there were pecans, you know,  
**[1:34:48-1:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:48):**  like walnuts or in a very rich soil of organic carbon continuously keeping residues going.  
**[1:34:55-1:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:55):**  So would that be the fast way?  
**[1:34:57-1:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:57):**  Certainly it would be the way of bringing soil health back into the picture.  
**[1:35:03-1:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:03):**  But in comparison it has to be done.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:05):**  And the difficulties, you want to increase yield and you say, how can you stabilize it?  
**[1:35:09-1:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:09):**  It will take longer because you've got to be remembered.  
**[1:35:12-1:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:12):**  One part of the conversation we had, you have to allow these organic carbon to be decomposed  
**[1:35:18-1:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:18):**  to release nutrients.  
**[1:35:20-1:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:20):**  And so fertilizer would give you the boost, but they already pulled you down.  
**[1:35:24-1:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:24):**  It's running with, you know, driving with your brain kind of cools because you already  
**[1:35:29-1:35:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:29):**  pulled you down by the emissions of N2O.  
**[1:35:32-1:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:32):**  So in a perfect world, if you had two plants that were equal, is it fair to say the one  
**[1:35:37-1:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:37):**  that produces more root biomass is sequestering more carbon?  
**[1:35:40-1:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:40):**  Indeed.  
**[1:35:41-1:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:41):**  So do you see a day where maybe somebody like a Corteva goes out there and they are engineering  
**[1:35:47-1:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:47):**  and breeding out plants like, so you have your corn plant that's already high yielding,  
**[1:35:51-1:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:51):**  but now we're going to breed that thing to put on as much root mass as possible?  
**[1:35:55-1:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:55):**  In one of the papers that actually I am writing with colleagues, we have identified, you know,  
**[1:36:01-1:36:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:01):**  venues of improving basically the future of becoming, let's put this, that we haven't  
**[1:36:07-1:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:07):**  introduced it, a more circular system.  
**[1:36:10-1:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:10):**  You know, circularity, there is a trend, was a few years ago, it's coming back, you know,  
**[1:36:15-1:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:15):**  circular economy, recycle, reduce waste.  
**[1:36:18-1:36:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:18):**  So the circularity in this way is basically through digital agriculture by doing the right  
**[1:36:24-1:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:24):**  thing at the right time in the right place, electric robots and genetic improvement, not  
**[1:36:30-1:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:30):**  only just deeper roots, yes, 100%, nitrogen fixing roots.  
**[1:36:36-1:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:36):**  Right?  
**[1:36:37-1:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:37):**  So that will be, it's not impossible because we can do just about anything.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:41):**  It's a matter of time and investment if you can do that.  
**[1:36:44-1:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:44):**  So imagine if fixing corn, I said, is still the king of the crop, right?  
**[1:36:49-1:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:49):**  Over 20 tons of biomass produced, 10 are taken out, 10 are returned.  
**[1:36:55-1:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:55):**  Compared to any other thing, you return maybe two or three, that's three, four times.  
**[1:37:00-1:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:00):**  You're gaining basically 10 years out of every two, three years.  
**[1:37:04-1:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:04):**  So that, the additional piece is electrification for overbosh, you know, creating fertilizer,  
**[1:37:12-1:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:12):**  synthetic, synthetic, which is not necessarily a word of saying fertilizer, it's a way of  
**[1:37:17-1:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:17):**  basically producing nitrogen the way natural is produced in terms of true decomposition,  
**[1:37:24-1:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:24):**  but it's readily available.  
**[1:37:25-1:37:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:25):**  So if it is obtained on the farm by having energy, and that's a long term, we're talking  
**[1:37:31-1:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:31):**  about future, right?  
**[1:37:32-1:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:32):**  It can be 15, 20 years, maybe less, maybe more, depending on the investment on the vision  
**[1:37:37-1:37:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:37):**  of our leaders.  
**[1:37:39-1:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:39):**  And if you produce fertilizer that is produced with electricity and not from fossil fuels,  
**[1:37:46-1:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:46):**  then we win, then we can certainly obey one degrees and all the concentration of CO2.  
**[1:37:53-1:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:53):**  So we touched on what's available now, the digital agriculture, the modeling and the  
**[1:37:58-1:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:58):**  forecasting and the robotics available now.  
**[1:38:02-1:38:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:02):**  Rooting and generating is coming up for sure.  
**[1:38:05-1:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:05):**  And electrification also is coming, so if there are labs doing that, if you put it all  
**[1:38:12-1:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:12):**  together, that's the pathway that I'm trying to publish.  
**[1:38:18-1:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:18):**  One thing we talked about previously, and you got me thinking about it now today, was  
**[1:38:24-1:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:24):**  climate change and how this affects things.  
**[1:38:26-1:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:26):**  So you have climate change happening, warming, and you have areas that are becoming, you  
**[1:38:31-1:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:31):**  know, maybe warmer, sooner, warmer later, warmer during the course of the season.  
**[1:38:36-1:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:36):**  At the same time, you go back to like the tropics where organic matter is being volatilized  
**[1:38:41-1:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:41):**  faster.  
**[1:38:42-1:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:42):**  So if you heat everything up, you're burning more energy, but if you have warmer temperatures  
**[1:38:47-1:38:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:47):**  for longer, your yield potential goes up so you can potentially sequester more carbon.  
**[1:38:52-1:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:52):**  How do those two fight against each other?  
**[1:38:55-1:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:55):**  It's very good.  
**[1:38:56-1:39:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:56):**  You must have a PhD.  
**[1:39:00-1:39:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:00):**  Good job.  
**[1:39:01-1:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:01):**  So temperature, it plays a critical role.  
**[1:39:04-1:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:04):**  Remember that as temperature goes up, everything is expedited.  
**[1:39:09-1:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:09):**  We sweat when it's hot.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:11):**  Plants do the same thing.  
**[1:39:12-1:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:12):**  So the cycle, to explain this straight off that you're saying, climate change for, there  
**[1:39:18-1:39:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:18):**  are winners and losers, right?  
**[1:39:20-1:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:20):**  I've done some work in Siberia, and it's a potential being benefited because you have  
**[1:39:26-1:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:26):**  a much longer season.  
**[1:39:28-1:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:28):**  Does it mean that in the middle of the summer it doesn't get hot?  
**[1:39:31-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:31):**  No, it gets hotter.  
**[1:39:32-1:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:32):**  Does it mean, and then what does it mean?  
**[1:39:34-1:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:34):**  They will still expedite development during that time.  
**[1:39:38-1:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:38):**  So the answer to your question is adaptation, adaptation to new cultivars.  
**[1:39:46-1:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:46):**  So if you use the same cultivar that is getting warmer and you only planted earlier because  
**[1:39:51-1:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:51):**  you know it's warmer, you're running short at the end.  
**[1:39:54-1:40:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:54):**  You're not taking advantage because the faster development that occurs, the degree days,  
**[1:40:00-1:40:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:00):**  the heat units that the plant has to accumulate, it will accumulate no matter what.  
**[1:40:04-1:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:04):**  They will accumulate now in August instead of mid-September if you anticipate.  
**[1:40:09-1:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:09):**  But if you have a much longer duration cultivar, then now you are sequestering a much greater  
**[1:40:15-1:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:15):**  yield.  
**[1:40:16-1:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:16):**  In fact, if you simulate a long duration cultivar, you basically have a much longer time to do  
**[1:40:24-1:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:24):**  growth.  
**[1:40:25-1:40:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:25):**  And so if you quickly allow me to explain, the plant does two processes.  
**[1:40:30-1:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:30):**  It grows and develops.  
**[1:40:32-1:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:32):**  The development is the cycle, is the duration of our long season on the ground.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:37):**  That's set by the minutes.  
**[1:40:38-1:40:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:38):**  Okay.  
**[1:40:39-1:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:39):**  That's set by number of degree days that is set.  
**[1:40:42-1:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:42):**  If it gets hot, those degree days are reached much quicker because the degree days are calculated  
**[1:40:48-1:40:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:48):**  as the air temperature minus the temperature that we call base temperature.  
**[1:40:53-1:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:53):**  The temperature below which the plant does not develop, stays in the same technological  
**[1:40:58-1:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:58):**  stages, doesn't go to the next phase.  
**[1:41:01-1:41:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:01):**  Growth is the accumulation of biomass, is a physical way of accumulation, more heavier,  
**[1:41:08-1:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:08):**  basically kilograms accumulated.  
**[1:41:10-1:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:10):**  So back to the 10 things and 100 things, instead of the selection, if you and I go have a different,  
**[1:41:17-1:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:17):**  I have 10 minutes to eat as much as I want and you have an hour, you will always eat  
**[1:41:23-1:41:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:23):**  more because you have an hour.  
**[1:41:25-1:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:25):**  So that hour is the longer growing cycle that you have because of a cooler possibility of  
**[1:41:35-1:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:35):**  not reaching those degree days in a much longer period of time.  
**[1:41:39-1:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:39):**  And so the higher the temperature, the shorter the cycle, the shorter the plants are going  
**[1:41:44-1:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:44):**  to be on that, the lower probability of the lower accumulation of photosynthesis.  
**[1:41:48-1:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:48):**  They're just less on that piece of land.  
**[1:41:51-1:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:51):**  They sequester less carbon through photosynthesis.  
**[1:41:54-1:42:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:54):**  So to your question is adaptation is if you use now a genetics that allows you to anticipate  
**[1:42:00-1:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:00):**  your planning, you cannot necessarily eliminate the heat in the middle of the summer, but  
**[1:42:07-1:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:07):**  you have now a longer period and you could sequester more and return more carbon into  
**[1:42:12-1:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:12):**  the soils.  
**[1:42:14-1:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:14):**  That's kind of a perverse way we can use global warming to our advantage to pull carbon out.  
**[1:42:21-1:42:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:21):**  Exactly.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:22):**  So many it is and the places in the north are better than they say is the next, the  
**[1:42:28-1:42:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:28):**  corn belt already now because you see the shift, the amount of corn that is grown in  
**[1:42:34-1:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:34):**  North Dakota, Minnesota, going into Canada, Saskatchewan.  
**[1:42:38-1:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:38):**  I mean, what's the first thing you call it?  
**[1:42:43-1:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:43):**  It's just getting better.  
**[1:42:44-1:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:44):**  And so that's a benefit.  
**[1:42:46-1:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:46):**  Was it the same amount of carbon sequestered before you had corn there?  
**[1:42:51-1:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:51):**  Far from it because the amount biomass that they're corn sequestered, right, is much greater.  
**[1:42:56-1:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:56):**  So that's exactly, they're winners.  
**[1:42:58-1:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:58):**  And does it get harder in places like, unfortunately it's always like this, you know, the harder  
**[1:43:05-1:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:05):**  place will get worse and so the more vulnerable areas are the ones that are already kind of  
**[1:43:10-1:43:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:10):**  in a more dire situation because more heat, more storms, greater storms, greater humidity  
**[1:43:20-1:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:20):**  in the atmosphere just creates obviously these extreme events and so on that is negative  
**[1:43:28-1:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:28):**  in addition to the higher temperature, which expedites the compositions and low organic  
**[1:43:35-1:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:35):**  matter at the moment.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38):**  One of the problems we've talked about today and you brought this up again in a previous  
**[1:43:42-1:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:42):**  conversation was, so we know nitrogen is a problem today, overuse of nitrogen.  
**[1:43:47-1:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:47):**  And you talked about some things you looked at in Italy where it was nitrogen management  
**[1:43:52-1:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:52):**  of how much nitrogen you're putting on versus nitrogen that's coming out in yield in the  
**[1:43:57-1:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:57):**  form of protein content in the crop.  
**[1:44:00-1:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:00):**  And there's not a lot of that here.  
**[1:44:02-1:44:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:02):**  I think that's a topic that a lot of people have heard nothing about.  
**[1:44:05-1:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:05):**  I don't know really anything about it other than what I've heard from you.  
**[1:44:08-1:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:08):**  Can you talk about that and maybe how that could shift the way we look at agriculture  
**[1:44:15-1:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:15):**  and with the way maybe producers farm?  
**[1:44:17-1:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:17):**  Yeah.  
**[1:44:18-1:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:18):**  I mean, as you know, California is very much like Italy.  
**[1:44:23-1:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:23):**  We're really blessed with the way the agriculture is in these areas in terms of the possibility  
**[1:44:29-1:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:29):**  of having so many sunny days.  
**[1:44:34-1:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:34):**  And so that's a possibility with good soils is a possibility of having products that they're  
**[1:44:40-1:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:40):**  much more favorable in terms of quality and just taste.  
**[1:44:47-1:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:47):**  But besides the vegetables growing in these areas and the possibility of smaller scale  
**[1:44:52-1:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:52):**  agriculture and spoon feeding and lower amount of fertilizer, there's almost no fertilizer  
**[1:44:57-1:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:57):**  used in these small patches of the quick rotations that I was mentioning earlier.  
**[1:45:04-1:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:04):**  I'm just describing the more high quality, slow food type of approach that goes into  
**[1:45:12-1:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:12):**  these soils to the schools and really high level of food and so on.  
**[1:45:18-1:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:18):**  What I've worked on for several times was an interesting question from producers of  
**[1:45:25-1:45:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:25):**  pasta production.  
**[1:45:26-1:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:26):**  Pasta is a very good food for vegans and pasta everyone is attracted.  
**[1:45:33-1:45:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:33):**  I know it is a carb and then people are more fearful of using it in an accumulate way instead  
**[1:45:40-1:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:40):**  of thinking of giving you the available energy to exercise and to do things and so on.  
**[1:45:45-1:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:45):**  So it's a very stable food obviously in Italy and so it contains normally about 12-13% proteins.  
**[1:45:54-1:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:54):**  So both the pasta for the companies like Parilla and Chico have pushed farmers to increase  
**[1:46:02-1:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:02):**  the protein content which is a greater quality, a better product that here unfortunately as  
**[1:46:10-1:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:10):**  far as I've talked to several wheat boards and growers and the use is much more for different  
**[1:46:18-1:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:18):**  topics you know crackers, lower quality and so the way you manage nitrogen there, first  
**[1:46:26-1:46:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:26):**  of all is lower in terms of amount because there's not enough water.  
**[1:46:31-1:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:31):**  It has to be very well synchronized when it's applied.  
**[1:46:35-1:46:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:35):**  It uses less nitrogen obviously then because it's a smaller biomass than maize but the  
**[1:46:41-1:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:41):**  timing of application plays a critical role in the way the proteins are accumulated and  
**[1:46:49-1:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:49):**  the interesting fact that this pasta production company made is yes we want higher protein  
**[1:46:56-1:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:56):**  content but that has to be coupled with a good grain.  
**[1:47:02-1:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:02):**  You can have higher protein content but it can be all grain.  
**[1:47:06-1:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:06):**  It's like really shivered more concentrated grain smaller and in Italy they say that will  
**[1:47:12-1:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:12):**  give that to the chicken and not for pasta production.  
**[1:47:15-1:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:15):**  So that can be 17-18%.  
**[1:47:18-1:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:18):**  So the weight of the grains are weighted in 100 you know in a ataletric weight and there  
**[1:47:24-1:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:24):**  are different testing test weights and so on.  
**[1:47:27-1:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:27):**  So the coupling of the quality of the grain with the endosperm and the protein means that  
**[1:47:33-1:47:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:33):**  you have to manage the crop well throughout and which means feeding the crop two three  
**[1:47:39-1:47:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:39):**  times fertilizer to basically make use of it and matching with the demand.  
**[1:47:45-1:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:45):**  So long story short if you put nitrogen towards the end of the uptake in wheat it goes all  
**[1:47:51-1:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:51):**  into proteins and so now you can have easily 14-15% protein and growers get a premium and  
**[1:48:00-1:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:00):**  it's a substantial premium from an economic point of view.  
**[1:48:04-1:48:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:04):**  It's an excessive incentive it's an additional incentives that they value because they were  
**[1:48:11-1:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:11):**  growing wheat no matter what they have incentives from the European Union so they do relatively  
**[1:48:17-1:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:17):**  well in terms of matching both a better management of a crop in addition to satisfying the demands  
**[1:48:24-1:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:24):**  until they get paid with a premium.  
**[1:48:26-1:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:26):**  But it comes from the private sector.  
**[1:48:30-1:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:30):**  The government in Italy and the European commissions provides incentives from an environmental  
**[1:48:36-1:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:36):**  standpoint the amount of needs to be used so the uniqueness was through this work is  
**[1:48:42-1:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:42):**  giving the right amount at the right time at the right place with the goal not just  
**[1:48:46-1:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:46):**  having higher yield but also higher quality of the grains higher proteins.  
**[1:48:52-1:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:52):**  You know being in the Midwest I mean do you think we're too yield centric now where a  
**[1:48:56-1:49:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:56):**  lot of application is just focus on bushels per acre and it's not quality and I don't  
**[1:49:02-1:49:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:02):**  think that's necessarily a big farm problem I think that probably translates all the way  
**[1:49:05-1:49:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:05):**  down to the smallest farms it's I need to produce volume and I'm not focusing enough  
**[1:49:12-1:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:12):**  and it sounds like a complex problem and a grower really has to know their operation  
**[1:49:18-1:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:18):**  where a plant is in the cycle and I don't know that there's an easy way to solve that  
**[1:49:23-1:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:23):**  but you know that seems like that's another future wave here of amending and growing for  
**[1:49:30-1:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:30):**  nutrient quantity and quality versus just weight volume.  
**[1:49:38-1:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:38):**  You have identified that's the current way of how you know the farmers get paid on productivity  
**[1:49:45-1:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:45):**  but I think there are three ways they can do you know basically productivity they can  
**[1:49:50-1:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:50):**  be monetized the environment and they can do better quality of the product if the consumers  
**[1:49:56-1:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:56):**  and so as you know Diego I mean agriculture is divided is agriculture and food system  
**[1:50:03-1:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:03):**  behind agriculture there is a significant amount of interest by multinational in managing  
**[1:50:10-1:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:10):**  the supplies you know got seeds fertilizer and so that drives they want to make sure  
**[1:50:17-1:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:17):**  that the seeds that they sell are optimized best conditions to get the greatest yield  
**[1:50:23-1:50:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:23):**  greatest yield means more money to the farmer there's no dent in that calculation there's  
**[1:50:30-1:50:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:30):**  three trillion kind of huge amount of money behind that concept and at the same time consumers  
**[1:50:36-1:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:36):**  say hey I can't drink the water in Toledo it's like what are you guys doing and you  
**[1:50:40-1:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:40):**  got to be doing things better now they already farmers are pulled back and say oh okay so  
**[1:50:45-1:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:45):**  we can't really do all these applications and we got to do that but the consumers need  
**[1:50:54-1:51:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:54):**  to realize that farm we in science we know a significant amount of money but sometimes  
**[1:51:00-1:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:00):**  they're not adopted because of profitability because of you know that will cost it will  
**[1:51:04-1:51:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:04):**  cost to the farmer and so somewhere they need to become you know basically either generates  
**[1:51:12-1:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:12):**  immediate money to the farmer some ways or and they need to be paid incentivized to basically  
**[1:51:17-1:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:17):**  be able to adopt their consumers at the same time so where does this money come does it  
**[1:51:21-1:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:21):**  always have to come from the government could come from a greater price so if you have three  
**[1:51:25-1:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:25):**  dollar eighty for a component if it was seven dollars that could afford some of that in  
**[1:51:30-1:51:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:30):**  terms of managing better reducing the deal because now they have a better price and that  
**[1:51:35-1:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:35):**  price will be compensated by the consumers wanting to do that and then and the farmers  
**[1:51:41-1:51:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:41):**  are the last one to really make money because think how much it costs you know stake that  
**[1:51:47-1:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:47):**  the grains has been fed versus you know the grain itself so the food system is very important  
**[1:51:52-1:51:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:52):**  in quality I wish we would have you know always the quality we would we have now just been  
**[1:51:59-1:52:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:59):**  exposed that we want things all the time right and there was there's no more seasonality  
**[1:52:04-1:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:04):**  there is no more in Italy there is again this concept of you know zero miles low by local  
**[1:52:11-1:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:11):**  I mean here too is becoming more important but a big producers that has a massive amount  
**[1:52:17-1:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:17):**  also wants to be able to export so it is a very complex system and so both the the profitability  
**[1:52:26-1:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:26):**  the environmental sustainability and the environmental justice for the community they have to come  
**[1:52:34-1:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:34):**  together and we're trying to do that with this more circularity making the system more  
**[1:52:39-1:52:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:39):**  circular there is science that has these visions about what we talked about which was not not  
**[1:52:45-1:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:45):**  a you know science fiction movie that's basically happening it was just a trailer and that will  
**[1:52:55-1:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:55):**  happen so I think that's the complexity of justify now that they get paid on productivity  
**[1:53:02-1:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:02):**  but it could change if everybody is willing to put their own their interest away in coming  
**[1:53:07-1:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:07):**  together of participating to that table by chipping in.  
**[1:53:11-1:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:11):**  Yeah in the state of Italy you mentioned you grew up around a system it was wheat, grapes,  
**[1:53:17-1:53:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:17):**  olives, pecans.  
**[1:53:19-1:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:19):**  I think that okay yeah I think that is a that poly culture system is a lot of what newer  
**[1:53:27-1:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:27):**  people looking to get into ag romanticize about how do you see I mean having seen systems  
**[1:53:35-1:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:35):**  like that why why do you think there have kind of been abandoned you don't see them  
**[1:53:41-1:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:41):**  as much outside of Europe and is there a viable future in that type of system?  
**[1:53:48-1:53:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:48):**  I have an optimistic look on that because new generation is becoming more attracted  
**[1:53:57-1:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:57):**  to the land to be able to do things I see a lot more young people wanting to do as you  
**[1:54:03-1:54:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:03):**  know agriculture is such a hard work and I think the combination of being green sustainable  
**[1:54:12-1:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:12):**  quality food being the food system in the open space obviously has so much attraction  
**[1:54:18-1:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:18):**  that's one of the reason I wanted to be in agriculture is actually to help to produce  
**[1:54:23-1:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:23):**  food and you know for the poor and so on but I ended up here by I use system that they  
**[1:54:30-1:54:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:30):**  go globally but and sustainability from an environmental standpoint so I think Europe  
**[1:54:37-1:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:37):**  has maintained because the way the population is I mean Naples metropolitan area is you  
**[1:54:45-1:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:45):**  know four million and then there are patches of land everywhere and growing and you can  
**[1:54:50-1:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:50):**  buy the just the best zucchini vegetables and so on when when the season is right and  
**[1:54:58-1:55:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:58):**  here you have that example in California I'm sure I mean it's just much more present there  
**[1:55:04-1:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:04):**  some parts in the New York outside the city and just about any city so we basically we're  
**[1:55:11-1:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:11):**  going towards a little bit more urban agriculture in many ways the term may not be right but  
**[1:55:16-1:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:16):**  that's what it really is right you know this polyculture the size is the land sizes makes  
**[1:55:21-1:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:21):**  a difference because imagine a small grower can't afford to have you know very net investment  
**[1:55:27-1:55:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:27):**  in much large machineries right and because of the sizes and so the size is compensated  
**[1:55:35-1:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:35):**  by having people to work and be able to be very dynamic and be building that soil health  
**[1:55:40-1:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:40):**  and so on but when you deal with the Midwest where your neighbor is 50 miles away you know  
**[1:55:46-1:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:46):**  you know you got and also the Midwest is still the Midwest because you can grow corn without  
**[1:55:51-1:55:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:51):**  irrigation you know 15% only of the Midwest is irrigated there is a demand for grains  
**[1:55:59-1:56:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:59):**  for you know feed the cows there is a demand for more vegan more plant-based so there will  
**[1:56:05-1:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:05):**  be a natural transition I envision not to necessarily not that I wish but not to see  
**[1:56:13-1:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:13):**  a major change in the way the land is distributed in terms of corn just because it's for the  
**[1:56:19-1:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:19):**  reason that I've said but I would see a significant amount of I've actually seen in Michigan much  
**[1:56:26-1:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:26):**  much more it's one after California is the most diverse type of agriculture and so a  
**[1:56:33-1:56:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:33):**  lot of the farmers that we work with very progressive they also have few acres unfortunately  
**[1:56:39-1:56:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:39):**  you know of vegetables the season is much shorter so they have to be dealing with that  
**[1:56:44-1:56:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:44):**  so I think it's a transition Diego that is slowly happening you see much more fresh market  
**[1:56:50-1:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:50):**  you know farmers going to them at the farmers market is beautiful farmers marketing Detroit  
**[1:56:55-1:57:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:55):**  it's a yeah it's it's the way the cities are distributed and it's happening slowly but  
**[1:57:05-1:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:05):**  surely also here.  
**[1:57:06-1:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:06):**  And just to close this out there's a lot of vegetable farmers listening to this smaller  
**[1:57:11-1:57:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:11):**  landholdings what would you encourage vegetable farmers to do to to build soil carbon to sequester  
**[1:57:20-1:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:20):**  carbon to grow better crops like what can they do in their systems given that they're  
**[1:57:26-1:57:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:26):**  fast rotations of crops what can a vegetable farmer do?  
**[1:57:32-1:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:32):**  I don't know if I necessarily have any suggestion for them because I believe they already do  
**[1:57:38-1:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:38):**  a pretty good job I mean to grow a vegetable you have to have a good soil the the things  
**[1:57:47-1:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:47):**  that we covered is just suddenly trying to minimize the amount of big tillage you know  
**[1:57:53-1:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:53):**  not flipping the soil is certainly if you want to go technical I wanted to be more philosophical  
**[1:57:59-1:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:59):**  that I think they already do a good job rotation is already something that is critical very  
**[1:58:05-1:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:05):**  very simply keep the soil covered don't farm naked you know basically keep the soil covered  
**[1:58:12-1:58:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:12):**  eventually hopefully one day say Bruno said they will I'll get paid by the amount of days  
**[1:58:17-1:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:17):**  my soil is green and hopefully that could happen so the tillage is really the mechanisms  
**[1:58:25-1:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:25):**  that does not allow that allows carbon to be lost you know immediately but if you retain  
**[1:58:32-1:58:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:32):**  if you keep the jar more closed within the limits of what the vegetables that you're  
**[1:58:38-1:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:38):**  growing some of them obviously will love carrots will love onions well those are but they can  
**[1:58:43-1:58:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:43):**  be done on a smaller scale to be able to still use regenerative type of approaches so if  
**[1:58:51-1:58:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:51):**  tillage is unavoidable be able to keep the soil cover and adding organic amendments it's  
**[1:58:59-1:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:59):**  certainly you know the way to do it I think any possibilities of using new technologies  
**[1:59:05-1:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:05):**  I'm not you know don't want to do the balance of economics but eventually one day there  
**[1:59:10-1:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:10):**  would be possibility of robotics one thing that really broke my heart during this pandemic  
**[1:59:16-1:59:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:16):**  obviously was seeing these vegetables people not having food in the supermarket and far  
**[1:59:21-1:59:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:21):**  fields not be able to be harvested so that's very sad California many and so eventually  
**[1:59:29-1:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:29):**  there will be technologies is coming and that doesn't mean it's going to fully replace people  
**[1:59:35-1:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:35):**  because they need many but you want to be also more independent from these sorts of  
**[1:59:41-1:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:41):**  threats that we may be witnessing unfortunately when more people come you know more frequently  
**[1:59:47-1:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:47):**  so technologies be able to collect data on what they learn from the past be able to collect  
**[1:59:55-2:00:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:55):**  what we call you know now this big data be analyzed and learn and analyze this data with  
**[2:00:01-2:00:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:01):**  help of scientists or anyone able to support their decisions because there is a lot of  
**[2:00:08-2:00:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:08):**  we always say if you can understand the past you can infer about the future there are changes  
**[2:00:13-2:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:13):**  in the future but you could predict some of those because some of the things are just  
**[2:00:18-2:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:18):**  frequent are more frequently repeating but we have had extreme event in the past they're  
**[2:00:23-2:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:23):**  just more frequent now right yeah and people can learn more about the work you're doing  
**[2:00:28-2:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:28):**  at cebo technologies.com for one last thing I mean being so involved in modeling carbon  
**[2:00:36-2:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:36):**  credit space do you see a day not too far ahead where any grower regardless of size  
**[2:00:44-2:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:44):**  could say here's what I'm doing I can sell carbon credits?  
**[2:00:49-2:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:49):**  I think it's a lot closer than you may think Diego I certainly hope so that's what actually  
**[2:00:56-2:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:56):**  cebo is pushing for forward is to be able to be able to quantify the regenerative potentials  
**[2:01:04-2:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:04):**  of saying I've done these practices that they can be verified and then we know how much  
**[2:01:12-2:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:12):**  carbon is going in and it's the strength of this is but how do you know is also the combination  
**[2:01:18-2:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:18):**  that we talked about is the abatement what are you not emitting by doing certain level  
**[2:01:24-2:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:24):**  of things and so it's in addition is both sequestration as well as reduction in the  
**[2:01:30-2:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:30):**  emissions that needs to be rewarded.  
**[2:01:34-2:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:34):**  Yes so start building your soil now so you can maybe get paid for that later.  
**[2:01:39-2:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:39):**  Certainly starting your soil one day this podcast will say those guys said it that the  
**[2:01:45-2:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:45):**  future will look more bright because of all this technology coming together and hopefully  
**[2:01:50-2:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:50):**  yes that that time is not too far but you need to build your carbon in order to stay  
**[2:01:56-2:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:56):**  healthy keep the soil healthy produce good quality crop and be able to maintain this  
**[2:02:04-2:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:04):**  consumer demand of transparency because I think overall the farmers are really honest  
**[2:02:10-2:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:10):**  genuine good steward of the environment and the land and anything that I can do to help  
**[2:02:15-2:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:15):**  in promoting science and information like accepting the invitation to speak with you  
**[2:02:21-2:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:21):**  today is really to show off the hard work that they do but all of that we have said  
**[2:02:27-2:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:27):**  it was above the parts and there is lots of there is all true to it need to build carbon  
**[2:02:34-2:02:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:34):**  and it will pay back.  
**[2:03:04-2:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-09-BrunoBasso-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:04):**  Thank you.

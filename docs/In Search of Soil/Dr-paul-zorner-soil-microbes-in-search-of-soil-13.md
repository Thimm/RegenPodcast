### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Sometimes nature works in mysterious ways.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:23):**  For example, you can add one microbe to a soil and you might not see any results at  
**[0:00:28-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  all. But if you add that same microbe to the soil in combination with other microbes, you might see  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  miraculous results. To talk about that concept and many others, today I'm joined by Dr. Paul Zorner  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  of Locus Agricultural Solutions. Paul is going to be sharing his decades of experience dealing with  
**[0:00:49-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  microbes in agriculture. Let's get into it with Dr. Paul Zorner. This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  You know, when you think about soil and measuring data from it, you know, a lot of times when you  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  measure something, there has to be a lot of knowns involved. Like you have to fully understand what  
**[0:01:11-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  you are measuring. Is there a danger for this tendency of science and large companies to be too  
**[0:01:20-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  reductionist when it comes to soil and implying A-B relationships. If A happens, then we expect B.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  Well, maybe soil is just so complex given our level of understanding now, we could run a trial,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  get a certain result, and not really understand why we got that result. I know a lot of people  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  who listen to the podcast, watch the videos, sometimes they'll question things and say,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:50):**  well, is there a study to support that? Is there a study to support that? And one thing I go back  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  to in my mind when I hear that is sometimes there's just not a lot of studies on this stuff,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  and there's not a lot of understanding around it, so there aren't the studies. So when you think  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:05):**  about where we are on the private and public sector looking at science, are we too reductionist  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:12):**  given our knowledge of all these complex relationships within the soil?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:17):**  And the system is complex. That doesn't mean we can't understand it. We need to appreciate  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  that it's complex to begin with. And I'm never one for, I think if you can measure things,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  it'll help ultimately fill in the gaps in our knowledge and should help better understand that  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  complexity. But it can be too much at times. Sometimes when you're talking to people,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  their eyes will just glaze over to start talking about oligotrophic versus copiotrophic organisms  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  and the Haney soil test versus chromic acid. And so I think what you have to be careful of,  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  use terms that people can understand, use language that's common to people, try to use analogies.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  And recognize too that intuition is a wonderful thing. I remember as a kid, I grew up on a farm,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  a horticultural farm. We grew specimen trees and azaleas and rhododendrons. Also had many,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  many acres of raspberries. My mom would go out every day with a shovel and dig up a little piece  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  of the field that she thought didn't look quite right to her. She thought looked really good and  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  she'd have me smell it. And say, hey, this smells good, this doesn't smell good, we've got to do  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  something here. And oftentimes it was like too much water, standing water, so she had a swampy  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  smell to her. She'd say, look, the soil isn't draining properly. And I think what modern  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  science is doing is just trying to assign some quantifiable numbers to that basic innate human  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  intuition. I was reminded that a couple years ago when we were working with a gas-met portable  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  FTIR, that's an infrared device that will allow you to measure the respiration of soil. You can  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  set it as a collar, you set it down in the field, and it'll analyze how much CO2 is being emitted,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  how much nitrous oxide is being emitted. You can quantify it. And I think of my mom every time I  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  do that, that she basically was that $80,000 gas-met portable FTIR, and she kind of had a  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  sense of what she was doing. And so I think there's a mix that, you know, we as human beings  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  probably do have a good perspective. Breeders, when I was with with Microgen and I talked to our  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  breeders, they can walk through a cornfield in terms of different, you know, cultivars that they  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  were evaluating, but they didn't measure squat. They just looked at the plant, its color, its  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  structure, and they were able to determine which ones were going to be the better ones. And  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:52):**  ultimately we did, you know, morphological quantification and genetic tests and things like  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:58):**  that. But I'd say nine times out of ten, the variety that was selected best based upon those  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  scientific measurements was the one that the breeder inherently knew. So the human being is a  
**[0:05:09-0:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  pretty accurate diagnostic organism, but you can't then layer that into a database and evaluate it  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:18):**  and share it with a lot of other people. You know, I've listened to some remarkable speakers,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:23):**  whether it's, you know, Gary Zimmer or a whole variety of people, or you listen to like  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  Kiss the Brown, the documentary that was just made, and Ray Archuleta. But they can't be  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  everywhere all the time. And so I think the ability now to collect data we might not have  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  been able to collect to quantify before, putting it into a database and then using it to then  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  understand and then communicate those principles to other people is a very good thing. But you just  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  have to recognize that also with statistics, you know, there's liars, damn liars, and statisticians,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  it's the old joke, right? That you can prove anything with statistics. And so it's all  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  something that you combine and you got to use common sense when you're evaluating these things  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  and talking about it. But the direct answer to your question is no, I don't think we're collecting  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  too much data. I think more data is better. We just need to evaluate it in a proper way.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  Right. Your reference there, Micah Jyn, if you go back to some of the early work there in the 80s,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  you're talking about pest control, biological control. What were some theories you were testing  
**[0:06:35-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  back then and how did that play out over time? Well, you know, the theory at the time,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  and being a weed scientist, I was looking for biological control of weeds and you would see,  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:48):**  you know, pathogens of any sort attacking a Wamskorder or pigweed or whatever it happened  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  to be, cyclopod was one we worked on with Alternaria, that if you were able to replicate  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:00):**  that and put the spores or put the vegetative cells out and, you know, create a rolling  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  infection that you could control the weeds in the absence of chemical pesticides. And that's true,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  but there's also a thing called the disease triangle where you have to have the right  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  environment, the right pathogen, and the right host. And if all three of those aren't just right,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:20):**  nothing happens. And so you might have the cyclopod and the Alternaria out there,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  but if there wasn't enough humidity and or residual moisture on those leaves,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  you wouldn't get the infestation and the infection. You know, by the way, a pathogen seldom totally  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:34):**  kills its host. That's not an ecologically smart game plan. So you're never going to get 100%  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  control. And of course, we've also lived with the fact that, look, a few weeds here and there  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  aren't necessarily a terrible thing. And you can hand hoe and do those for the rest of it. So the  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:51):**  same thing would have applied to insect control, where we were using things to create a rolling  
**[0:08:00-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  infection in different insects. Or we helped develop the potassium salt of oleic acid, which  
**[0:08:09-0:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  is commonly known to people as safer soap. We call it a P. And it's a fatty acid, and I'm sure  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:17):**  a lot of your users have probably used safer soap. It basically melts the exoskeleton of soft-bodied  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:24):**  insects, but leaves a lot of the harder ones, especially the beneficial insects alone, just  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:28):**  fine. And so we worked on that. It was an organically registered product. And we even had a  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:33):**  fatty acid called pelargonic acid that was a remarkable herbicide. Literally, you could spray  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  it like on oxalis. You'd spray it and watch the oxalis melt within about 30 seconds. But the thing  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  is, fence row to fence row, that product was about $180 per acre. Well, other than for specialized  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  situations, homeowners, landscapes, things on those lines, spot control, it wasn't going to be  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:57):**  economically feasible. So at Mycogen, I think we had a fair amount of success with different things  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  that we were doing. But again, it had to be integrated and had to be economic. And it didn't  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  necessarily always give complete control. It gave good control. But certain people wanted to see  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  complete control at the time as well. We weren't working on soil health. Ironically, my wife's a  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  plant pathologist, and she worked for a company called Advanced Genetic Sciences in Berkeley.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  During the early 80s. And she and Trevor Suslow, her boss at the time, who I think is at UC Davis  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  now, we're working on exactly what we're working on at LOPUS today, looking for microbes as soil  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  amendments to improve yield and quality and soil health. But the tools they had to do that were  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  basically, okay, let's recover some things from the soil, brew them up, put them back and see if  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  we can improve upon productivity compared to the controls. Today, we can do a lot of measurements  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:00):**  to help us understand how to optimize that and bring that technology along a little faster. So I  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  think it's all been there for a while, but we're just getting better at trying to understand the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:09):**  biology. Being a weed scientist, what are your thoughts on weeds and their function in succession  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  of a landscape? There's something I've heard always on the more regen ag side, the permaculture  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  side of, you know, weeds are soil indicators. They're going to tell you what's going on in your  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  soil and they're there for a function. And if you continue that theory out over time, once that  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  issue within that soil is repaired by the weed, which is there to repair, then the soil gets to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  a point where weeds are no longer needed because there isn't a function in the soil that needs to  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  be repaired. When I explain that, or if you hear that, what are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  Well, I am a weed scientist. I'm actually an elected fellow of the Weed Science Society of  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:06):**  America. When I was in graduate school, Bob Zimdahl was my advisor at Colorado State working  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  on my PhD. And I wrote a paper called In Defense of Weeds, which addressed some of this. I'm a  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  systems ecologist, or at least I like to think of myself as a systems ecologist. I got an  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:23):**  undergraduate degree in biology from Lewis and Park College in Portland, Oregon, and we just  
**[0:11:27-0:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:27):**  did a lot of ecological measurements. So I agree with the majority of what you just said. Weeds  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:37):**  are an indicator. Now, there's no doubt weeds compete for nutrients, water, and a whole variety  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  of things. Harold Coble at North Carolina State University and many other people back in the  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  70s and 80s did a lot of work that if you get a certain weed population density in the presence  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  of the crop, you've got a problem. But I kind of look at weeds sometimes as cover crops. I mentioned  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  Gary Zimmer before. Gary taught me no brown soil ever. And I'm sure people that you've talked to  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  have talked about this as well. Bare soil is a travesty. Because in essence, whether it's a cover  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  crop or more better, a mixture of cover crops, weeds could be the same thing. Those plants are  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, photosynthesizing it. And any normal plant will exude  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  anywhere from about 20 to 40 percent of its photosynthate out through its roots to feed the  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  microbes below it. So if there aren't any plants in the soil at any particular point in time, you're  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  not feeding those microbes and they're not going to be there, at least at the population  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  densities. They're going to go dormant or they're going to go away. So I think weeds are an indicator  
**[0:12:42-0:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  species. I did my PhD thesis on weed seed ecology. There are billions of weed seeds that are present  
**[0:12:51-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:51):**  in any acre of soil and they can survive for 150 years. There's a Dr. Beale's seed experiment at  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  Ohio State. I remember from the 1980s that he had started 100 years before and you were still  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  getting seed that were viable after 100 years. And that's a whole other amazing conversation to have,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  is how can that be? Because they actually are respiring. But weeds come up as that they are  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  pioneer organisms. In other words, if you have bare soil, that's the first thing you generally  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  see. A bunch of weeds sprout up. Weed seeds are normally dormant, but when they're hit with direct  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  sunlight, that's red light, that'll break their dormancy. When other species begin to grow as well,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  more of the secondary species, light gets filtered through that canopy and it becomes a far-red  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  source and that's generally inhibitory to weeds to grow. So there's ecological principles, but I  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:46):**  think we want to be kind of anthropomorphic about it. I agree. I think weeds are telling you  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  something. Number one, nature forms a vacuum and if you have bare soil, something's going to grow  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:56):**  there. And that gets things started in terms of, you know, kick-starting the biology of that soil,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:02):**  especially the microbial population, and kind of setting the stage for nutrient recycling,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:08):**  organic matter, a whole variety of things that ultimately are going to be beneficial to whatever  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  secondary organisms come in, whether it's a natural, you know, forest situation and you  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  eventually get, you know, a canopy and more of a mature forest, for example, after a couple  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  hundred years, or you come in there and you plant corn or soybeans or alfalfa or whatever it happens  
**[0:14:33-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  to be and are trying to establish that as your kind of dominant crop. But I think weeds and cover  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  crops are probably closely related in terms of what they do. A cover crop is a little bit more  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:49):**  manageable in terms of seeding density and, you know, types of things we know it'll contribute to  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  the soil. But yeah, I think you can learn a lot from watching weeds and looking at population  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:00):**  density of weeds in your soil. I think ultimately when you get your crop established,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  you want to be very careful about letting them grow because they will steal water and nutrients  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  from the crop and cause some issues. In terms of stealing water and nutrients from the crop,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:17):**  is that offset at all by having potentially another biological layer within the soil?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:23):**  So let's say you have a corn field. That corn's growing tall. It's up in the air. It has a certain  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  root profile it's putting out. And then let's say you have purslane growing in the soil. It's flat  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  on the soil. It's covering areas of the soil. The corn couldn't. It probably has a different  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:39):**  root profile. They could be competing, but is there also some offset of that competition to a  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  net positive given the purslane there and maybe that's doing things that are helping? So it's not  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  just a total, let's say, 10 minus 5. It might be 10 minus 5 plus 2. That's a really good analogy.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:02):**  You know, it's interesting you had mentioned purslane. I don't know if you've ever had purslane  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  salad, but purslane is very good, yeah, uh, uh, weed to eat. You know, that the the definition of  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  a weed, by the way, is a plant out of place. And so in your situation, can you really call personally  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  a weed in that particular situation? Is it out of place? It's potentially contributing to something.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:22):**  And I agree with you. I mean, I've done a lot of work in India. And if you go to an Indian sugar  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:27):**  cane field, for example, or corn or soybeans, you'll see them growing corn or alfalfa or soybeans  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  or turmeric or all kinds of things in the rows before the canopy closes on the sugar cane.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:40):**  And again, they're getting a yield from it. But I think what we'll find in time that those crops  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  are contributing, you know, complex carbohydrates to the soil that actually benefits the sugar cane.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  Because I think, you know, what we're learning is that any plant actually provides that useful  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  function. It'll draw CO2 out of the atmosphere, you know, convert it to a complex carbohydrate,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  exude some of those carbohydrates and other nutrient-rich materials from their  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  roots to feed the microbes. The microbes in turn will capture that, consume it as a food.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  And if they have certain functionalities like nutrient recycling, you know, liberating manganese,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:23):**  iron, magnesium, phosphates from the soil and putting them in a form the plant can use,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  or that their biomass, you know, accumulates and gets deposited as organic matter,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:36):**  will help hold water. Yeah, you could make a case that that purslane, to use your specific example,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  actually was potentially adding to that. Because if the purslane is underneath a canopy of corn,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  for example, I wouldn't worry about trying to control it because it's not going to be very  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  effective because it's a very high-quality purslane.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:57):**  It's not going to be very effective because it's again, you know, now getting that far red light  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  and it's going to be limited in terms of what it might be able to do anyway. Yeah.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  If you look at it, well, maybe two definitions of weed. You have a plant out of place and then  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  you have it's performing a soil reparative function. Do you think if you had healthy enough  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  you could create soil conditions that would not allow weeds to grow or do you just,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  or does that theory not hold weight? Well, it does. It's simply, if nothing else from the canopy  
**[0:18:37-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  I talked about. If you get enough of a canopy and if you get enough plant residue, you know,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  I also, back in the early 80s, I was an assistant professor of agronomy at the University of  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  Kentucky and they were very involved in what is today, you know, the development of what's now  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:56):**  called conservation tillage or no tillage. We called it trash farming back in those days  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  in Kentucky because you just had a bunch of crop residue on the field that you would plant  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  directly into it with a knife. Well, if you have that residue on the soil surface,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:13):**  it's going to inhibit weed seed germination. It's going to allow for better infiltration of water  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:20):**  and if you then get the crop canopy up and going, yeah, you're not going to see many weeds and a lot  
**[0:19:27-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  of people do, even if you get some weeds. You can go in there with like a Lemke cultivator or  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:35):**  a crimper and just do very shallow tillage. You know, no-till is one thing. I think, you know,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  the top five centimeters of soil you can get away with doing some tillage to incorporate some of  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  that residue, get it interacting with the soil so it'll degrade, but also to control weeds. I talk  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  about Gary Zimmer and I apologize for using it all the time, but he's a god in my mind. I really love  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  him. But he took me to one of his organic fields and literally there was not a weed anywhere. It  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  was a cornfield. I said, you're lying to me. There's no way this is an organic field. And so  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  he explained to me the types of things that I was just talking about there and so, you know, the  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  answer is absolutely yes. You can farm to a certain extent without using herbicides. If you have  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  Johnson grass or some perennial weed or Canada thistle, it might be a different story, you know,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  because those perennial weeds will kind of be able to exude or overcome some of that. But I think for  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  the most part, if you can use the right types of practices, you could probably reduce weed control  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  to spot treatment as opposed to fence road to fence road broadcast herbicides. You look at common  
**[0:20:49-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  cultivated herbaceous plants, tomato, lettuce, basil, those types of plants. Are they higher up on  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  the succession order than weeds? Since most of those have been bred out from wild plants, which  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  some like nightshade we would consider weeds today, are they on the same kind of plant level as  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  a weed? The reason I ask is because people go to this relationship then, well, if you improve soil  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:21):**  succession occurs and you move up to higher order species, and if you are trying to improve your  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  soil as a farmer, are weeds and plants you want to grow really on the same succession level because  
**[0:21:34-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  they came from the same lineage, so where if it was say weeds and berries or weeds and trees,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  now you're moving higher up? Yeah, I don't know if I have a good answer for that. It all comes back  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  to the robustness of the plant's ability to interact with its environment and creating an  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  environment from an agricultural perspective that favors the crop you're trying to optimize.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  It puts things you don't want there at a disadvantage. You tilt the field in your favor,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  literally, with shallow tillage cover crops, establishing a good canopy,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:22):**  and all of a sudden the plant that you're looking to optimize, the tomato or the pepper,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:30):**  yeah, that's a good analogy because there are like common nightshade as a weed,  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  and they probably are from a genetic viewpoint, probably similar in terms of how they deal with  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  the environment, but you've used agricultural practices to put your crop at an advantage.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  Certainly, you're not ever going to get to the point in a normal agricultural field where you're  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:54):**  going to be planting trees, conifers, or things like that unless you decide to change your  
**[0:22:59-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  plant. You may go from a crop to putting in pasture. People do things like that.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  So there are some major transitions in going from agricultural crops to pasture or rangeland,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  or you switch from an annual crop like strawberries or tomatoes and then plant almonds  
**[0:23:24-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  or grapes or things along those lines or alfalfa, but I think in general, any crop has an ability  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  to succeed in the environment you create for it and many a weed is going to try its best to do  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:38):**  that as well, and that's where the agricultural practices come in and why it's important  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:42):**  understanding what each one contributes to that ecosystem in order to be able to achieve what  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  you're trying to do yet still retain the health and the sustainability of that soil. You don't  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  want to borrow from that soil in years one, two, and three and then be paying for it in years five  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:59):**  through fifty because you didn't farm in a sustainable way or even farm now in a regenerative  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  way that actually builds soil because farming is all about growing soil. Ray Archuleta talks about  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  that. We're trying to grow soil. A lot of people have a hard time trying to understand, well,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:18):**  what does that mean? What means you're trying to build biomass and nurture the microbes and  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  get all that together so that when you do put your crop into it, it actually benefits from that  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:29):**  and adds to the ability to grow soil. Crop productivity and soil health are two sides of  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  the same coin. One contributes to the other. When you look at weed growth itself, is there,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  are there different microbial relationships between different types of weeds? So you have  
**[0:24:45-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:45):**  voxalis, you have sludge, you have lambsquarter, you have purslane. One thing people could say is,  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  well, they're repairing the soil by what they do. They create above ground biomass and they have  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  some sort of root, whether that's a mat of roots or that's a deeper tap root that goes down and  
**[0:25:05-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  does something to compaction, but it's doing it in concert with microbes. Do different weeds have  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:13):**  different relationships with different microbes? Yeah, I don't know the answer to that, but I think  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:17):**  in a very short period of time, we're going to be able to determine that. So I'll back up a  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  little bit. Now I'm going to mention a company that we're starting to work with called Biome Makers,  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  B-I-O-M-E, Space Makers, M-A-K-E-R-S. They have some really cool technology in terms of  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  being, not only do you use metagenomics and sequencing to determine who's there in terms  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  of the microbes, but also what function they perform because that's actually even more important.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:45):**  That's okay. It's fine to determine from a metagenomic sequence what organisms are present,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  but you really need to know what functionality they're providing. So set that aside for a minute  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:57):**  and then think about the, I think the general consensus in the agricultural community is that  
**[0:26:03-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  a single cover crop is not as good as multiple species in a cover crop, vetches, legumes,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  grasses, tillage radishes. Tillage radishes put this huge beautiful root down, right? We'll break  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  up hard pan. But what we don't know from a scientific viewpoint, or I don't know any papers  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:21):**  right now, I'm sure there are probably people out there that actually have looked at this and I'm  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  just not aware of it, is all right, your question, do those different species contribute different  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:32):**  types of complex nutrients that will stimulate a broader range of microbes and therefore a broader  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  range of functionality into that metagenome, that rhizosphere? Now I suspect the answer is a hearty  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  yes because I think that's demonstrated by the fact that anybody that talks about cover crops  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  will really encourage you to use several different species of cover crops than just a single one.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  That diversity is a good thing. So where then has,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:06):**  well let's compare two paths that agriculture has taken on really the science and the corporate side  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  of things. One path is, I'll call it the regenerative ag side. It's cover crops, it's no-till,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  it's nurturing biology to build soil to get a higher yield. Yet traditional ag or conventional  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:27):**  ag has gone after, we're going to chase yield via maybe methods that don't directly  
**[0:27:34-0:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  encourage biological soil building. So we could fertilize, we could till, we could spray to get  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:43):**  more yield. And if you look at the yield curve of things like corn and soybeans over time,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  those yields have gone up tremendously. Where do you think the chemical side of ag starts to top  
**[0:27:57-0:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  out in terms of yield potential? And is that method of agriculture really depleting soils  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:08):**  over time because it isn't building biology as much as is a more regenerative system? And on the  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  flip side, what do you think is possible for regenerative systems that use different microbial  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  products like you guys produce and also just basic things like no-till and cover crops?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  Can the biological side of things catch up to where conventional is?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:35):**  Well the answer to that last question is yes because conventional embraces biology.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  Conventional embraces regeneration. I mean if you go all the way to one side and say okay I'm going  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:47):**  to moldboard plow 18 inches deep, 12 inches deep and I'm going to use 150 pounds of N and

**[0:29:04-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  and fungicides. Yeah, you got a problem. But I would have to say that that's not conventional  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  farming anymore. People are adopting no-till, people are adopting strip tillage, people are  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:18):**  adopting conservation tillage. People are recognizing that look I can save on input costs  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  by reducing the amount of fertilizer I'm using. But I recognize that too much nitrogen, too much  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  phosphate, too much potassium actually inhibits microbial growth. You put too much phosphate,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:36):**  you put too much phosphate, you slow down if not put in stasis, mycorrhizal activity.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  People recognize that well I can use tillage in certain places to control weeds. I don't  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  necessarily have to go fence road to fence road with a broadcast herbicide because all those  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  things are inputs, they cost money. And so if you can do it more effectively by creating a more  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  sustainable farming system and lower what you're doing, have greater output versus lower inputs,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  then you increase your farm income. And so maybe your question was well can you divide a line  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  between good and bad? Well I don't think you can do that today. I think the majority of growers,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  A, they care a lot about their ground, they're going to use what tools they need to, but they  
**[0:30:26-0:30:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  recognize that regenerative practices are really important to everybody and I see rapidly advancing  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:35):**  recognition of that and rapidly advancing desire to learn more about how to do that.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  I work at the grower Roy Paulman in western Nebraska, he has 10,000 acres of corn,

**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  several faculty from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, IBM, Brandeuler, a cell phone company,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  you know a whole variety of people where he's invited them to come to his farm and do things  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  and then collect the data. Then working with professors at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  that are really skilled in data analysis and artificial intelligence to kind of help him not  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  only figure out what's good for his farm but then do the outreach necessary to teach his neighbors  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  about it so his neighbors can teach their neighbors. I see a sea change in people's attitude  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:31):**  about this over the last five years and the desire to embrace and practice regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:40):**  I don't see a lot of deep tillage, I see some, but you don't see a lot of it anymore. You still see  
**[0:31:47-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  people with brown soil or not planting a cover crop or things along those lines, but I think  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  as that knowledge gets spread around people are recognizing that's an important thing to do  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  and beginning to embrace. Don't you at some point if you  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  if you say microbes in the relationship they have with plants are based upon  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:15):**  inputs in the soil. So if I fertilize a plant with something I add to the soil  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  then the plant says well I don't have to go maybe form this relationship with this microbe to go  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  get it because I can just suck it up right here you gave it to me. If you are in an input  
**[0:32:38-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  based ag model whatever that is conventional or organic are you stunting the biological potential  
**[0:32:49-0:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  of the soil by just giving plants what they need versus dialing inputs back and forcing  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  plants in the soil microbiome to generate what the plant needs? Well that enforcing is the wrong term  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  I think allowing is a better term. It's a natural ecosystem so nothing's being forced.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  So let me back up. The advice given by a lot of people these days is feed the soil not the plant.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  For exactly the reasons that you're talking about that look if you feed the soil the soil will feed  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  the plant. We do a lot of work in Florida and Florida was built on a bed of dinosaur  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  bones. There's a lot of insoluble phosphate in Florida soils. If you have the right microbial  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:38):**  populations they will liberate phosphate to feed the plant. You don't necessarily need to be  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  applying in many situations need to be applying a lot of inorganic phosphate.  
**[0:33:50-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  But I think what we're seeing is A the plant needs a healthy root rhizosphere. In other words  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  it needs a population of microbes in its root system in order to help create those conditions  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  where the plant can effectively interact with the soil in order to get those things it needs  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:13):**  to produce an optimal crop. You're 10 times as many human cells sitting here today. I'm 10 times  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  as many bacterial cells as human cells and so am I. Without all those bacterial cells  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  especially in your gut and your intestines you wouldn't be functioning. I think we've learned  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  that we want to take probiotics but we also want to take prebiotics you know fiber things to feed  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  those microbes. We want to be careful in terms of taking penicillin because it'll knock the heck  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  out of that microbiome. Well plants are no different. Those plant roots need that microbiome  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  and that plant will actually nurture them. It'll exude those complex carbohydrates and nutrients  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  as I talked about earlier in order to optimize the population or at least grow the population  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  of those microbes. But then those microbes interact with each other as well because they're performing  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:07):**  a whole bunch of functions. We kind of talked about it's not who's there it's what  
**[0:35:11-0:35:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:11):**  function do they provide. And so it's a matter of getting organisms that will liberate  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:19):**  micronutrients like magnesium and zinc and iron and those things that the plant needs.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  You have free-living microbes that will fix nitrogen, azotobacter, agrobacterium. We all know  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:32):**  about rhizobium and its interaction with with late to medium crops. But there are lots of free-living  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  nitrogen fixing microbes that are important that can really remarkably reduce the amount  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  of inorganic nitrogen needed because they can capture it from the atmosphere. So I think it  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  comes back to if you can allow those ecological relationships to form and don't get in the way of  
**[0:35:54-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  them, you can really create a system that needs a drastically reduced amount of  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  conventional inputs. And the things that interfere with that are deep tillage, not shallow tillage I  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  don't think, but deep tillage. And other people might argue with that. I'm just giving you my  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  opinion. Some people say well no tillage whatsoever. I do think shallow tillage is probably just fine.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  Or over applying nitrogen and phosphate really will shut down some of the microbial biology  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  because it signals the the microbe like mycorrhiza and phosphate it signals the mycorrhiza well I've  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:31):**  got enough phosphate liberated around here I don't need to be digging anymore up. And then that  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  process slows down. So like I say you have to look at it as an ecosystem as a balanced  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:44):**  system where the microbes really are going to do a lot not only for the soil but for that plant.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  They're constantly communicating with each other.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  Say somebody's in a no-till situation they have cover crops that they're growing like they're  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  doing what they can via management practices to encourage soil growth. If you wanted to  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  I'll say fast track and then maybe slow track on a long ecological scale things along in terms of  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:15):**  building soil do you think adding microbes to the soil makes sense?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  My initial answer is yes and I have to admit I have a conflict of interest. I work for a company  
**[0:37:28-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:28):**  that sells microbial soil inoculants right and so what we see is when you add  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  select species to a natural environment you generally will see a response in terms of  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  greater productivity. It's not just us it's other people as well. But you don't see a lot of  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:48):**  activity it's not just us it's other people as well. But you don't see it consistently that's  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  one of the things about microbial soil inoculants they're generally considered inconsistent at best  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:56):**  and snake oil at worst right. But they do work and so the question becomes well why is that?  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:04):**  Why couldn't you just develop a natural population to do that same thing? And again to go back to  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  Midwestern Bio Ag and Gary Zimmer you know they will feed humic acid and they'll use no-till and  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  they'll do a lot of things and over time their hypothesis was well we can and also  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:23):**  composting that we can build that up more naturally than applying a direct fed microbial  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  if you will microbial soil and then now the fault of that logic is what is manure or what is  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  you know running sheep or cattle over a field you know well you're adding microbes  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  that's what manure is it's a prebiotic and probiotic you know think of the microbes  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:46):**  we're adding as probiotics agricultural probiotics and oftentimes you need to have what we call a  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:51):**  microbial food supplement kelp extract, humic acid, molasses. In India we use milmah you know  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  all the residue of crushing the sugar cane and putting back everything but the sugar  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  back on the field. So that's kind of akin to feeding the soil with particular microbes  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  and we can talk about why I think that's useful. Well let's not why do you think that's useful?  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  Yeah okay so and Gary Harmon who's a professor a retired professor at Cornell wrote a really nice  
**[0:39:28-0:39:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  paper on trichoderma review paper and he talks about trichoderma in particular and other you  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:35):**  know soil fungi and microbes and talks about the fact that there are certain microbes that  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:41):**  really do seem to even if they're naturally present like many trichoderma species are  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:46):**  naturally present in the soil but sometimes population density makes a real difference.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:53):**  It's like a probiotic you know people would argue I'm going to answer your question here  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  in a minute I realize I'm circling around it but you know if you're not taking a probiotic  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  you should be but some people would say well if you drink kombucha and eat you know raw  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  sauerkraut and kimchi and things along those lines you'll be just fine yet there's a body  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  of scientific evidence that say look there are certain probiotics that are better than just  
**[0:40:17-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:17):**  trying to get it all from your environment. Well the same thing with agricultural probiotics  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  and there's a thing called quorum sensing. Do you know what quorum sensing is or maybe  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:30):**  some of your listeners would not know what it is? Explain that. Okay so quorum sensing  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:34):**  the best analogy I can make is like you're sitting at a party and you know it's midnight  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  and it's really not very exciting and you're about ready to signal to your friends hey  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  let's go home or go somewhere else well all of a sudden somebody shows up with live music  
**[0:40:50-0:41:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:50):**  and alcohol and boy things really start to click. Well that's quorum sensing and it's  
**[0:41:02-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:02):**  a relatively well accepted scientific principle that microbes practice quorum sensing. That  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  there are certain microbes that will stimulate activity in others. In other words it is kind  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  of interesting that you've got a billion cells per gram of soil already in most soils so  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:24):**  you've got people like us taking rhizolizer and putting it into the field which isn't  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:29):**  nearly that that density and you're magically getting these responses and you do get them.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  We see increases of 20% to 80% in certain crops with the addition of our trichoderma  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  plus the psilos combination and so you kind of think well how are they competing? Well  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  they may not be competing with those other microbes they may actually be turning them  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:51):**  on and a good kind of anecdote I have for that I worked for Diversa Corporation here  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:57):**  in San Diego for a long time. Diversa was instrumental in the development of the field  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  of environmental sequencing which is now known as metagenomics. Environmental sequencing means  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  you just go in there and you just sequence everything. 99% of the microbes in the world  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  aren't culturable. We could find them through metagenomics but we can't actually make them  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  grow and so we did a lot of environmental sequencing and you could eventually through  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  annotation determine okay there's all these different species there but we're always frustrated  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  by the fact and this is the the mid-2000s that okay we didn't know what the culture looked like  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  or we couldn't culture them. So Eric Mather and his team got together and they were able  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:43):**  to encapsulate one or two cells in a gel bead that was permeable then they would extract the  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  cells from the ocean, a peat bog, soil, whatever it happened to be, back a column with those gel  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:57):**  beads and then run a solution of soil extract or ocean water whatever happened to be through that  
**[0:43:03-0:43:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  and lo and behold things just started to grow like crazy and the message to me was that they  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:11):**  were all communicating. In other words when you try to use Cook's principles right which is  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  a single organism you know on a plate and get it to grow independently well these are social  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:23):**  creatures they won't grow oftentimes independently they need each other and they need certain  
**[0:43:30-0:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  signals. So quorum sensing to me and the reason I think microbial soil amendments work as long  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:39):**  as they're alive and fresh and are put out at high enough density and they're put out with things  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  that they can feed on these microbial food supplements we should talk about that, that they  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  may be acting as quorum sensing in other words they're completing that picture and the kind of  
**[0:43:55-0:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:55):**  the other analogy of that that I use is like you buy a Ford F-150 all tricked out and it's  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:04):**  got gas intake but you forgot to put a steering wheel in it well you're not going anywhere or you  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  go I played French horn in high school in the symphony orchestra and if you went to a full  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  orchestra with everybody there it's just a wonderful experience but if you leave that  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  especially if you leave out the French horns but also the violins it's just not going to be the  
**[0:44:23-0:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  same thing nobody's going to perform as well and so I think what happens with those organisms that  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  we have found work well as microbial soil amendments are acting to improve everybody  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  around them they're acting to a certain extent as quorum sensors that will actually cause that  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  whole ecosystem now to bloom a little bit you know more you know prolifically and get everybody  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  involved in creating the functionality you want to create the optimal environment for that crop to  
**[0:44:53-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  grow is this the case then that anything you can do to add microbes to your soil would probably  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:05):**  be beneficial it's just a question of how beneficial so if I think about  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:10):**  traditional ag if we look around the world you have biodynamics you have Korean natural farming  
**[0:45:17-0:45:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:17):**  you have composting you have people doing compost teas or do you think that just blanketing all  
**[0:45:26-0:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  those things that they're helpful it's just a matter of how helpful they actually are  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:33):**  I think you have to have the right number one you need to support the native microbiology that's  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  there through all these regenerative practices that we've talked about composting cover crops  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  minimum tillage a whole variety that in order to to you know make as healthy as possible those  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  microbes that are naturally in the soil but I do believe and like I said I think composting is  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  is in this category that if you're going to then add microbes or running your cattle over over  
**[0:46:03-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  your over your pasture you're adding microbes and that that that will help stimulate those other  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  organisms that are there to perform a matter and I think it's a matter of having a functional  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:18):**  metagenome so let's talk about environmental sequencing in a metagenome what is that well it  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  it comes back to the symphony orchestra we'll use that one as a continuing example that that  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:31):**  you may have a micro present but it may not actually be actively growing until it until it  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:38):**  tell it you know get stimulated to do so by another organism it could be that putting the  
**[0:46:43-0:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  right microbe in that particular metagenome will actually turn everybody else on so ultimately my  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:51):**  answer is yes that if you can find the right organisms that have the right functionality  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  to complete that metagenome to make it as functional as possible you're going to improve  
**[0:47:02-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  things and I do think that you then also have to create an environment for that added microbial to  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  do its job which is typical regenerative practices like I said you also we feel I feel I think  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:14):**  there's data to support from other people as well that you you you want to to add materials that  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  that organism can use for food uh because it it needs to get started and and you know and tell it  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  can get itself established with a growing crop and let the roots feed it uh it's going to have  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  a hard time expressing that functionality that that whole metagenome needs uh now so it's almost  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:42):**  like you're starting a business and you know initially maybe you need to accumulate some funds  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  to buy inventory to get the business up and rolling then eventually that business is doing  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  enough sales or services whatever it's doing that it can fund its own growth but without that  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:59):**  initial injection of cash if you're just relying on sales from day one it might be a slow start or  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  a no start yeah no I think that's a that's a reasonable and good analogy um  
**[0:48:13-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  you know the the the the other part of it is is is also I think recognizing that the same  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  set of microbes at least the optimal set of microbes are going to be different for  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  citrus in Florida than for you know uh hops in Oregon and Washington so all types are different  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  the climate is different or a microbe that you apply in February in cold soil might not be the  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  same microbe you apply in July under warm soil conditions for different environments and we're  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  learning that ourselves within our own research but I think ultimately where we're going to head

**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:57):**  that is what it should be when it gets to the grower these are live organisms and when they're

**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  you've got to have a microbial food source you better be combining it with a prebiotic of some  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  sort and to allow it to get better established in its environment number two with the microbial  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  soil amendment you better make sure it actually gets down to the roots you know we apply all of

**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:55):**  course you need to have those regenerative practices in place as well at least at least  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  to the greatest extent you can to provide you know those soil conditions that are important for that

**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  inconsistency as well as what you just talked about well do you have the right combination of  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  microbes for that crop in that soil type you know we have a we have a fungal organism trichoderma  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:20):**  in a bacterial organism bacillus and they're on purpose because they they pair well with each other  
**[0:52:27-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  either one alone probably wouldn't be able to do the same job and so if you have microbial  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  inoculants that don't pay attention to you know kind of an amplified functionality that you get  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  from having both a fungal component and microbial component i don't think necessarily going to work  
**[0:52:45-0:52:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:45):**  as well as when it does and you have to apply it a at a cost-effective mechanism you know growers  
**[0:52:53-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:53):**  can only pay so much and two we also have found that you do have to reapply them they don't  
**[0:52:59-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  necessarily and yet way you also have to apply them at the right density you you can't you know  
**[0:53:07-0:53:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:07):**  put something out that isn't at a high enough population density to impact upon the rest of that  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:13):**  microbial population that's there to truly do its job so what we find too is we're generally applying  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:20):**  optimally two three even four times a year in a perennial crop in order to keep that population  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:26):**  density of that added microbe up to the point where it can serve as the conductor you know  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:31):**  of the orchestra that we we described earlier to get everybody and keep everybody working at optimal  
**[0:53:36-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  peak efficiency so if you have optimal density of that microbe it's up here and you know application  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  after application that keeps it topped off what what's what's stopping it in the natural system  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  from naturalizing and ramping its own population up to these levels or beyond why when you don't  
**[0:53:58-0:54:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  apply it can what was applied not live and reproduce enough to push up to these higher levels  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  well i'm sure there are many people that argue they should be able to and i'm i will tell you i  
**[0:54:13-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:13):**  wish i knew the answer to that right now our early research suggests that no you got it you got to  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  top it off from time to time uh i think with like with the bio makers and they're and there are  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:25):**  other other companies that can potentially do this as well when you take a look at not only who's  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  there but what function are they performing we'll have an answer to what you're saying that we'll  
**[0:54:36-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  figure that out that we'll see the combination of things that might allow a single application  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  of a of a microbial soil amendment it'll be enough for a season at least  
**[0:54:48-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  uh like i said i i think the folks at midwestern bio egg often argued that you know if i if i keep  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  at this over a period of three or four or five years i can get to the point where i can certainly  
**[0:54:59-0:55:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:59):**  see like a 20 increase in yield with a 20 decrease in inputs is that the most they could achieve  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:06):**  could they could they could could that kind of a system be improved even further faster by adding  
**[0:55:12-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:12):**  a microbial soil method i think so because you do see with certain types of compost systems i know  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  you've interviewed david johnson at new mexico state with his beam system that's a remarkable  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:22):**  system and he inoculates it right and he puts it back up he sees phenomenal increases in yield but  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:28):**  he also sees a much greater prevalence of fungal organisms in that soil he gets he gets a more  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  fungal dominant soil well those are all clues to to what's going on and and my point on a microbial  
**[0:55:40-0:55:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  soil amendment it's somewhat analogous to creating a an inoculum uh in in that that would ultimately  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:50):**  be represented by a composting system because what that composting system does is it provides  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  both the probiotic and the prebiotic you're having a food source and you're having the microbes  
**[0:56:01-0:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  i think i think a fermentation broth with uh highly dense and with with the right kind of  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:10):**  prebiotic in other words the microbial food supplements is potentially a little more scalable  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:14):**  and more rapid than a composting system but they also can exist in harmony really really well yeah  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  i like an analogy used before when we were talking is you know what is what are microbes in their  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  second generation compost it's compost it's broken down and it's eight and now you have the microbes  
**[0:56:31-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:31):**  left if you think okay well well some is good well more should be better and if money wasn't  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  an object and i don't know the rates of application of a rise eliser you guys have but let's say it's  
**[0:56:45-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:45):**  a gallon per acre if you did a hundred gallons per acre could you expect like exponentially  
**[0:56:54-0:57:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  better results or yes well interesting rise eliser application rates are three ounces per acre by the  
**[0:57:00-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:00):**  way uh along with six ounces of microbial food supplements so we'll start there and we have  
**[0:57:06-0:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  tested 10x that and we do see an improvement we don't see any any negative impact but at some  
**[0:57:13-0:57:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:13):**  point in time you get a plateau that it only goes up so far because we do test to make sure we don't  
**[0:57:20-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:20):**  see any negative implications of applying too much material uh and we don't but if you applied  
**[0:57:29-0:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  instead of three ounces if you apply uh nine ounces or 15 ounces we'll see uh an impact uh  
**[0:57:38-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:38):**  but that impact will gradually diminish it still is maintained that's also a function of the soil  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:45):**  type we generally find that we actually work a little better on heavier soils more organic matter  
**[0:57:50-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  soils than we do on sanders soils and that that on sanders also if we apply more material we can  
**[0:57:56-0:58:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  kind of reduce that gap uh and that actually speaks to what we were talking about too in terms  
**[0:58:03-0:58:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:03):**  of quorum sensing that you know a heavier more organic matter-laden soil probably has a greater  
**[0:58:07-0:58:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:07):**  microbial population to start with and therefore the quorum sensing you know you don't need as many  
**[0:58:13-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:13):**  rise eliser conductors to to stimulate what's going on but again we need we need those tests  
**[0:58:21-0:58:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  like i mentioned with biome makers where we can actually plot that out and and and truly take a  
**[0:58:27-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:27):**  look at not only the the the metagenomics but the functionality in the in the metabolomics are you  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  familiar with the term proteomics or metabol there's an omics for everything right genomics  
**[0:58:42-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:42):**  uh metagenomics metabolomics proteomics well metabolomics is getting a sense for what

**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  some more roots down because we are being very anthropomorphic here but we are we are here and  
**[1:02:34-1:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:34):**  we're solubilizing nutrients we're fixing nitrogen we're doing all this stuff and so if you expand  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:39):**  your root system you're going to find a lot of good stuff that that the energy you put into  
**[1:02:45-1:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  growing roots is worth it because we're here we're going to be able to return more on that investment  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:50):**  of you putting roots down uh because what you also see associated with that generally is an  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  increase in leaf chlorophyll density which should mean greater photosynthetic flux which should mean  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:01):**  greater accidents in the soil which should mean greater microbial growth which by the way with  
**[1:03:06-1:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:06):**  the right kind of microbes and we should talk about this generally results in increased organic  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:10):**  matter and we all know that organic matter is also very good especially if it's in the form of  
**[1:03:16-1:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:16):**  making a lot of both micro and macro soil aggregates that are important for aeration

**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:42):**  for what you're offering so it's taking that trade on you know a farmer is asking that same question  
**[1:03:47-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:47):**  they're going to say well you know these products they sound interesting can they benefit my yield  
**[1:03:53-1:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  like i'm going to trade dollars for product which then results in more yield for me a lot of people  
**[1:04:00-1:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:00):**  listening to this are on the vegetable side can you talk about some of the studies and trials  
**[1:04:04-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  you guys have done on the vegetable side and what you've seen when you know we have worked  
**[1:04:10-1:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  extensively on tomatoes and peppers uh i will admit we started off predominantly in permanent  
**[1:04:15-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:15):**  crops citrus greening in florida uh sod blueberries uh all fold strawberries into a  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  into a vegetable crop i realize it's a fruit and it could be a perennial but oftentimes it's farmed  
**[1:04:30-1:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  as a manual but generally what we see is a you know a 30 to 40 percent increase in yield to  
**[1:04:35-1:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:35):**  potatoes i'll put in there as well and what we'll see is the crop the crop will jump out of the  
**[1:04:41-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:41):**  ground faster like in potatoes we did a study in imperial valley where we treated every other row  
**[1:04:47-1:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  with rhizolizer uh and literally the rhizolizer treated rows were out of the ground 10 days before  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:53):**  the non-treated rose and the grower came by and oh my god what did you do to my field you've  
**[1:04:58-1:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:58):**  you've killed every other row it's like no no you know everything that was treated just up wait for  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:04):**  it and sure enough eventually those others came up and they were very excited because in a cold  
**[1:05:09-1:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:09):**  wet season yeah they could maybe get the ground the crop out of the ground faster and get it to  
**[1:05:14-1:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:14):**  market faster with that and then we see anywhere in potatoes from a seven percent to a forty percent  
**[1:05:19-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:19):**  increase in yield but almost uniformly we will see uh more into class a or or versus class b or us  
**[1:05:29-1:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  number ones versus us number twos in tomatoes we generally see higher bricks more yield peppers  
**[1:05:37-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:37):**  greater yield in strawberries uh we see larger fruit we can turn like a  
**[1:05:44-1:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:44):**  20 count box into an 18 count box strawberries it goes backwards by the way a larger fruit is a  
**[1:05:49-1:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:49):**  smaller count box uh and and generally increase bricks increase color uh and several of our  
**[1:05:59-1:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:59):**  growers have self-reported that they've been able to to reduce uh npk applications by anywhere from  
**[1:06:06-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:06):**  15 20 and one case one bar could reduce it by 40 in florida in very sandy soils and my belief in  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  that is well number one we increase because we generally see an increase in in nutrient uptake  
**[1:06:18-1:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:18):**  nitrogen phosphorus things along those lines into the plant we generally see an increase and  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:23):**  we've chlorophyll density uh but we see those deeper roots and expanded root systems so in  
**[1:06:29-1:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:29):**  a sandy soil if you've got a deeper more volumous root mass well you're not going to in a sandy soil  
**[1:06:37-1:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:37):**  in a heavy rainfall climate you're not going to get it washed down below the root mass is easier  
**[1:06:42-1:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:42):**  therefore you ought to be able to use less because it's it's got a greater capacity of taking it up  
**[1:06:47-1:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:47):**  throughout a a deeper soil profile so all those things go into into you know that you know the

**[1:07:00-1:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  guys address the location issue or my biome issue if i'm in california somebody else is in quebec  
**[1:07:08-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:08):**  and somebody's in florida are we getting the same jug of stuff well you are getting the same  
**[1:07:14-1:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  jug of stuff uh this particular point in time although we're introducing there's riser lyser  
**[1:07:19-1:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:19):**  we're introducing a product called pantago which is a yeast that is it has similar performance

**[1:07:32-1:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:32):**  better and perform better under cooler soils than rise allies as well but we also will adjust uh  
**[1:07:38-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:38):**  uh the application rate like six ounces instead of instead of three ounces four applications a

**[1:08:00-1:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:00):**  to then you know optimize it for specific regions if not you know fields and well so we're we're  
**[1:08:09-1:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:09):**  working very closely internally but with people like biomarkers and others to get a handle on okay  
**[1:08:15-1:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:15):**  no kidding what's going on what can we do to follow the population ecology of what we put down  
**[1:08:20-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:20):**  versus what's there and the impact upon it and combine that with these other practices such as  
**[1:08:24-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:24):**  adding a microbial food supplement adding compost adding a cover crop no tillage all those things  
**[1:08:30-1:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  also as a function of time of year of climate irrigation schedules right like i said before  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:35):**  this becomes a knowledge intensive program that sometimes can get a little heavy for people to say  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  just tell me what to do right and so you have to really think about okay how can we simplify this  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:45):**  in terms of helping grow understand uh what he or she needs to do when and where on their on their  
**[1:08:51-1:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:51):**  farm and what they what they think is best this isn't a matter of us coming in and say hey we're  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:55):**  from the government we're gonna help you we generally try to understand with every grower  
**[1:08:59-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:59):**  we work with okay what are your pain points what problems do you have what's your soil type  
**[1:09:04-1:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  you know and then determine that we actually can help uh because we don't think we can we're not  
**[1:09:09-1:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:09):**  going to go in there and try to put something in place that we don't feel is going to do them  
**[1:09:14-1:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:14):**  any good or at least come back when we think we have a different solution for them right what  
**[1:09:19-1:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:19):**  about in terms of time the application a lot of people listen to this they're transplanting crops  
**[1:09:28-1:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:28):**  is there a benefit do you think of using product yours or somebody else's a microbial type product  
**[1:09:35-1:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:35):**  at time of seeding if they're doing transplanting so it's in contact with the roots as soon as the  
**[1:09:41-1:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:41):**  roots start forming and then they're transplanting that little cube of inoculated soil and root mass  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:46):**  into the ground well absolutely i'm a big fan of that you know anything that where we have a seed  
**[1:09:51-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:51):**  crop from other crops strawberries uh blueberries you know things that are transplanted not a  
**[1:09:56-1:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  tomatoes and peppers are transplanted these days i i think the best program would would be to  
**[1:10:03-1:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:03):**  inoculate them in the greenhouse and then transfer them and then they transplant water have inoculum  
**[1:10:10-1:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:10):**  as well and then maybe feed them again a third time uh in order to truly get things going  
**[1:10:16-1:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:16):**  especially if they if they have for example fumigated their field the strawberry grower  
**[1:10:22-1:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:22):**  you know because you're basically wiping out everything you know once you do that  
**[1:10:25-1:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:25):**  that's why if you get on a z-pack or something like that as a human you better be taking a  
**[1:10:30-1:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:30):**  probiotic immediately after you do that to kind of re-establish what's going on  
**[1:10:34-1:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:34):**  but i think absolutely uh that's the way to go when you're doing those things  
**[1:10:40-1:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40):**  what about your were your thoughts on feeding the soil using something that we're adding as  
**[1:10:47-1:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:47):**  humans so not by plant scrolling i've heard people like dan kittridge mention things like well he  
**[1:10:53-1:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:53):**  might add some molasses or a sugar type spray to his soil if they've had really cloudy days  
**[1:10:59-1:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  photosynthesis is down they've had a big stretch of that you want to keep the microbes pumping so  
**[1:11:04-1:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:04):**  he'll run sugar into the soil do you think that you could see a benefit of adding different  
**[1:11:12-1:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:12):**  microbial food sources to the soil just on their own you're not adding microbes you're just trying  
**[1:11:18-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:18):**  to feed the microbes that are there beyond yeah i think so i mean there's a company ql qlf quality  
**[1:11:24-1:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  liquid feeds uh that that has molasses based fertilizers uh and i know other people that are  
**[1:11:33-1:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:33):**  that are doing that that's again i'm being redundant with the compost that's what compost  
**[1:11:39-1:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:39):**  is you're adding a food source as well as the microbe itself uh but i i do believe there are  
**[1:11:45-1:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:45):**  some you know you that particular example i hadn't heard before but if you've got you know  
**[1:11:50-1:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:50):**  cloud cover and reduced photosynthesis yeah that kind of makes sense that if it's reduced  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:56):**  photosynthesis you're probably not getting the flux of complex carbohydrates into the rhizosphere  
**[1:12:00-1:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:00):**  that you would otherwise so why not tap it if it if it economically makes sense why not put a  
**[1:12:06-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:06):**  little food source in there i think one of the things we need to explore is well what kind of  
**[1:12:10-1:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  food source is best for what microbes uh you know molasses is pretty readily accessible although  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  there's a lot of reducing sugars in it versus uh humic acid which is a little bit more complex  
**[1:12:24-1:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:24):**  it's like eating uh fiber instead of you know uh or whole wheat bread versus white bread right  
**[1:12:31-1:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:31):**  you know because they say it's a little harder to digest or putting your potatoes you know in  
**[1:12:35-1:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  the refrigerator after you cook them to create more resistant starch uh that's a little more  
**[1:12:40-1:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:40):**  difficult so it doesn't impact to digest it doesn't impact your glycemic index as much  
**[1:12:45-1:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:45):**  i think we'll learn things like that with with those types of foods and again it comes back to  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:49):**  you know trying to understand the microbial ecology and and having an easy way to measure  
**[1:12:54-1:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:54):**  those things uh because i think we'll learn a lot from to be able to optimize and provide data for  
**[1:13:01-1:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:01):**  a question like that when we can when we can not only functionally understand that better but do  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:08):**  it such that the grower can actually do it on the back of their tailgate so we've worked internally  
**[1:13:13-1:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:13):**  on a program to kind of develop something that that's easy you know it's not going to do the  
**[1:13:18-1:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:18):**  grower much good if it costs them five hundred dollars an acre to do that kind of sampling you  
**[1:13:23-1:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:23):**  know and their return is only fifty dollars an acre so we we've got to develop these tools and  
**[1:13:29-1:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  then scale them and get the cost down to where it makes sense and to where it's deployable  
**[1:13:34-1:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:34):**  on a field scale you know sending things back to the lab is fine right now but yeah that's two weeks  
**[1:13:41-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:41):**  or you have to you have to have a cheap enough sample that you you can take enough samples to  
**[1:13:45-1:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  get rid of variants or if you just took one sample for field well what if your what if your dog peed  
**[1:13:50-1:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:50):**  on that spot you know yesterday uh you know it's you need to be able to do enough sampling but  
**[1:13:56-1:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:56):**  that makes sense as well and so you know people are looking at spectral reflectance and  
**[1:14:03-1:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:03):**  you know robotic probes and all kinds of things in order to scale it and reduce the cost.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:09):**  You know with all your work with microbes over the years are there  
**[1:14:12-1:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  off the shelf options that you think would be great for feeding microbes in the soil?  
**[1:14:18-1:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:18):**  You know we've talked molasses, humic acid, is there anything else that comes to mind?  
**[1:14:22-1:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:22):**  Yeah, kelp extract is very good we with that we work with a company called Nature Source,  
**[1:14:26-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:26):**  311 has great product it's a it's it's it's a fermentation product of of natural natural crop  
**[1:14:34-1:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  plants you know so and you know I think people are trying to best optimize what's in there you  
**[1:14:39-1:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:39):**  need some micronutrients you know you need a food source maybe some protein amino acids you know  
**[1:14:44-1:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:44):**  quote-unquote protein protein hydrolysates in order to provide a complete food for the  
**[1:14:51-1:14:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:51):**  microbes that you're trying to feed or the endogenous microbes that you're trying to feed.  
**[1:14:54-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:54):**  Whether through the work that you all have done or any partners that you've worked with or anywhere  
**[1:15:02-1:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  you've worked in the past do you find that there's common groups of microbes that tend to be missing  
**[1:15:10-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:10):**  in cultivated agricultural soils?  
**[1:15:14-1:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:14):**  Yeah I wish I could answer that I'll bet you other people that you have worked with could probably  
**[1:15:21-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:21):**  answer that better than me I'm I'm just beginning to try to take a look at things like that.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  In general you know trichodermin and mycorrhiza for example is fungi and you might determine that  
**[1:15:34-1:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:34):**  I think those two are important in particular and they are but they're you know there are literally  
**[1:15:39-1:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:39):**  millions of bacterial species and hundreds of thousands of fungal species in every spoonful  
**[1:15:44-1:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:44):**  of soil so it's a matter of what's there and at what population density and their ability to then  
**[1:15:54-1:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:54):**  get turned on and so I think if you can if you can if we go back to that quorum sensing principle  
**[1:16:02-1:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:02):**  that if you get the right band together you know with the right song you know you're gonna you're  
**[1:16:07-1:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:07):**  gonna wake up the right guys and girls and and have a fully functional microbiome so I don't  
**[1:16:14-1:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:14):**  I don't know if there's anything missing per se although I suspect there probably is but I don't  
**[1:16:20-1:16:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20):**  think we really know enough yet to kind of make that determination and hopefully some of these  
**[1:16:25-1:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:25):**  new tools will allow us to do that and it's not necessarily even the microbe that's missing  
**[1:16:29-1:16:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:29):**  it's the functionality and so I'm beginning to think too that that you may have a situation  
**[1:16:37-1:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:37):**  in certain you know say northern soils versus southern soils that you may find a particular  
**[1:16:42-1:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:42):**  fungi is missing in the northern soils that's present in the southern soil you think oh I've  
**[1:16:46-1:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:46):**  got to add that microbe back but what you really need to know well is the functionality present  
**[1:16:52-1:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  it's quite likely that that a particular microbe that's in the southern soil it's not in the  
**[1:16:57-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:57):**  northern soil might have a brother or a second cousin that's a different species or even a  
**[1:17:02-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  different genus that still provides that functionality so we need that metabolomics  
**[1:17:06-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  function to tell that oh how about that those microbes have adapted something that grows better  
**[1:17:13-1:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  under those particular conditions that particular climate has become the dominant species provide  
**[1:17:18-1:17:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  that function as opposed to one that that is present in Louisiana or in Brazil I don't have  
**[1:17:26-1:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:26):**  a lot of evidence of that but I think when we get at the end of the day we're going to find that's  
**[1:17:30-1:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:30):**  the case. When you guys arrived at something like trichoderma why did you feel that was important  
**[1:17:37-1:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:37):**  to include in the mixture? Yeah we did a lot of research in terms of reading the literature  
**[1:17:44-1:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:44):**  you know my major professor in college Bob Dindo I says they call it research for a reason right  
**[1:17:49-1:17:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:49):**  somebody's generally done something they don't call it search and so you know we stand on the shoulders  
**[1:17:56-1:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:56):**  of giants right Gary Harmon and Joe Klepper at Auburn and I could go on and on in terms of people  
**[1:18:01-1:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:01):**  that have contributed to this and so we tried to study and then we added our own kind of mindset  
**[1:18:07-1:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:07):**  in terms of which strains to use and how to combine them the necessity of keeping them fresh  
**[1:18:14-1:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:14):**  you know we sell our product as a as a as a cold chain it's shipped coal to the grower in a in a  
**[1:18:21-1:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:21):**  cold pack and to optimize we also produce it at very high densities and and can do that economically  
**[1:18:28-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:28):**  so that we're applying absolutely fresh material at a high density a combination of a fungi and  
**[1:18:33-1:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  bacteria that and also the microbial food supplement that we put with it yeah so there's a  
**[1:18:39-1:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:39):**  certain amount of this that that you know we learned by looking at the literature but there's  
**[1:18:45-1:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:45):**  also a certain amount of it that we did that when we did the studies we found that you wouldn't  
**[1:18:51-1:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:51):**  expected those results and so that combination of things that we that we recommend to people  
**[1:19:00-1:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:00):**  I think are unique to what we're trying to accomplish. Well even based on that research  
**[1:19:05-1:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:05):**  like what does trichoderma do as part of that soil metagenome like what function is that performing?  
**[1:19:12-1:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:12):**  Number one fungi have a much larger genome than bacteria do you know prokaryote versus a  
**[1:19:17-1:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:17):**  eukaryote and we haven't talked about it yet but certainly another important function here  
**[1:19:22-1:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:22):**  that's the other side of the coin of crop productivity is is carbon sequestration  
**[1:19:27-1:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:27):**  and as you know we we have a leading program called carbon now where we're helping growers  
**[1:19:34-1:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:34):**  utilize common farm working with nori in the carbon marketplace and and helping them just  
**[1:19:39-1:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:39):**  on their their current and past regenerative practices forget about rhizolizer for a minute  
**[1:19:44-1:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:44):**  in terms of helping them get compensated for their practices that have added carbon to the  
**[1:19:49-1:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:49):**  soil that wouldn't have been there had they not doing these particular regenerative practices  
**[1:19:53-1:20:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:53):**  so back to trichoderma. Trichoderma is a is a is a eukaryotic fungi and if you read the literature  
**[1:20:02-1:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:02):**  most people will not most i say i think the pertinent literature will support the statement  
**[1:20:09-1:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:09):**  that you're going to get net carbon sequestration if you have high carbon use efficiency organisms  
**[1:20:15-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:15):**  and i'll i'll talk about that in a second but generally a fungal dominant soil what you want  
**[1:20:21-1:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  are organisms that when they consume the nutrients that are being exuded from the plant or that you're  
**[1:20:28-1:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:28):**  putting there or might be present in the soil already turn that carbon into biomass as opposed  
**[1:20:34-1:20:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:34):**  to respired co2 if it's a low carbon use efficiency organism that that eats and you know you know  
**[1:20:42-1:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:42):**  respires and and and doesn't put on biomass you're you're you're not going to do much for carbon  
**[1:20:49-1:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:49):**  accumulation in the soil uh stuart grandy at the university of new hampshire uh uh ponjak  
**[1:20:56-1:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:56):**  uh travetti at colorado state i mean there are many others i think are showing that that that  
**[1:21:05-1:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:05):**  ratio of fungal to bacterial microbes or oligotrophs versus copiotropes as panjack likes to call them  
**[1:21:15-1:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:15):**  or high carbon use efficiency versus low carbon use efficiency as stewart grandy uses is very  
**[1:21:22-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:22):**  important and so adding trichoderma create as a adds the ability to create a more fungal dominant  
**[1:21:30-1:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  soil uh and for example that's one of the reasons that minimum tillage or no tillage becomes  
**[1:21:36-1:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:36):**  important because fungi develop mycelia uh you know yards if not you know maybe even miles of  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  them i don't know if you've ever seen a fairy ring in a forest you know what that is no it's a  
**[1:21:49-1:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  you know it's a circle of mushrooms okay and that circle can be three feet across or three miles  
**[1:21:55-1:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:55):**  across well they're like an aspen forest they're all one organism uh and so the fungal hyphae are  
**[1:22:02-1:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:02):**  just an extended root system in terms of communicating with the plant but as they consume  
**[1:22:09-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:09):**  those nutrients from the crop they simply uh added on as biomass and so that gets accumulated as  
**[1:22:15-1:22:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  organic matter all organic matter is a microbial product it may have originated in the plant either  
**[1:22:22-1:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:22):**  as those nutrients or as fallen leaves or stems or what have you but they generally have been  
**[1:22:27-1:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:27):**  processed by those microbes especially the fungi to to that build up in the soil so we think  
**[1:22:33-1:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:33):**  trichoderma is very important because it's a very powerful elicitor in terms of metabolites  
**[1:22:39-1:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:39):**  that's i mentioned the paper by gary uh harman and he's the father of trichoderma if you want  
**[1:22:45-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:45):**  to put it that way other people have done some nice studies as well mycorrhizae is important  
**[1:22:50-1:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  as well uh but that fungi add a lot of genetic complexity they are very good at converting  
**[1:22:58-1:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:58):**  sugars and plant material to microbial biomass fungal biomass that then gets deposited as carbon  
**[1:23:06-1:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:06):**  and they're very good at converting those secretions to materials that also will help  
**[1:23:11-1:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:11):**  aggregate soil in the micro and macro aggregates that becomes a very important part of the story as  
**[1:23:16-1:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:16):**  well because what you see in generally a degraded soil it's almost like dust uh you know it doesn't  
**[1:23:23-1:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:23):**  have a lot of structure to it when you see a really healthy soil it generally has a lot of  
**[1:23:27-1:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:27):**  structure which which generally means that a good organic manner has a lot of micro and macro  
**[1:23:31-1:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:31):**  aggregates and those macro and micro aggregates are almost like housing you know condos for the  
**[1:23:36-1:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:36):**  microbes because the microbes form those and they're inside of there and helps protect them  
**[1:23:41-1:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:41):**  against degradation and helps hold moisture and helps with nutrient exchange all kinds of  
**[1:23:47-1:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:47):**  interesting things and and fungi in particular have the genetic machinery to be able to stimulate  
**[1:23:53-1:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:53):**  all that can you talk a little bit about carbon sequestration i've seen this come up in the  
**[1:24:01-1:24:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:01):**  comments and i think this confuses some people and they don't fully understand this is how can you  
**[1:24:08-1:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:08):**  have plants and microbes sequester carbon in the soil when they're eating respiring and some of them  
**[1:24:18-1:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:18):**  respire carbon dioxide themselves which is then going back up into the atmosphere so if you're  
**[1:24:24-1:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24):**  adding more microbes that respire co2 how does it not net out to zero and how are you actually  
**[1:24:33-1:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:33):**  sequestering that carbon dioxide into the soil or carbon into the soil through plant microbial  
**[1:24:42-1:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:42):**  interactions and not preventing the excess from going back up into the atmosphere yeah okay good  
**[1:24:49-1:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:49):**  point um and it comes back to these high carbon use efficiency versus low carbon use efficiency  
**[1:24:54-1:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:54):**  organisms so let's start at the top literally uh atmospheric co2 it's a resource for that plant  
**[1:25:03-1:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:03):**  plant are remarkable carbon pumps they take carbon dioxide facilitated by photosynthesis and turn into  
**[1:25:10-1:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:10):**  complex carbohydrates that that uh create stems leaves fruits roots a whole variety of things  
**[1:25:18-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:18):**  and as i said before depending on who you read or what crop you know you're getting at least 15 or  
**[1:25:23-1:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  20 exit dates maybe up to 40 exit dates of that photosynthetic uh complex material that's fed into  
**[1:25:31-1:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:31):**  feed those microbes okay so the microbes will concern that and there are certain populations  
**[1:25:36-1:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:36):**  of microbes that yeah they're they're they're they're they're not very efficient they'll consume  
**[1:25:42-1:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:42):**  that it's like a teenage boy right actually maybe a teenage boy because they are growing that's not  
**[1:25:46-1:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:46):**  a very good example maybe like me right uh i i'll i'll eat all this stuff and and i'll just respire  
**[1:25:53-1:26:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:53):**  it out as as co2 but a a young growing child will will take this food in they'll put body mass on as  
**[1:26:01-1:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:01):**  well in other words high carbon use efficiency in other words the amount of carbon they consume to  
**[1:26:06-1:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:06):**  the amount of body weight or biomass that they put on is very high point nine point eight where you  
**[1:26:12-1:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:12):**  get certain organisms that will consume you know a kilogram of the population will consume a  
**[1:26:18-1:26:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:18):**  kilogram of sugars and respire you know uh nine tenths of a kilogram out is co2 we actually saw  
**[1:26:26-1:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:26):**  that when we did our initial studies with with this gas met you know analyzer i mentioned earlier  
**[1:26:33-1:26:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:33):**  it's a it's a portable ftir and you can measure nitrous oxide and you can measure carbon dioxide  
**[1:26:39-1:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:39):**  uh emissions and we're just out there trying to show to the grower that that we're hopefully  
**[1:26:44-1:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:44):**  changing you know the soil because then with the citrus grower you know they get one look a year  
**[1:26:49-1:26:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:49):**  right they see the number of boxes that come off their field and that's kind of you know their  
**[1:26:53-1:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:53):**  yearly testimony on on whether what they're doing is getting better or worse we're trying to do  
**[1:26:59-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:59):**  something to help them understand you know on a more frequent basis how they could think about  
**[1:27:05-1:27:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  their soil and we we put root traps in the ground uh where we could they're like a chicken wire column  
**[1:27:12-1:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:12):**  you pull them up after six months or a year and you could actually see you know the the differences  
**[1:27:17-1:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:17):**  in the root mass well we wanted something else as well so we were doing spectral reflectance  
**[1:27:22-1:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:22):**  and taking a look at chlorophyll density but we thought well let's take a look at soil respiration  
**[1:27:26-1:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:26):**  well sure enough we saw a 35 reduction in co2 emissions and a 80 reduction in nitrous oxide  
**[1:27:33-1:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:33):**  emissions and so like holy cow this is like my mom smelling soil right we just have a an electronic  
**[1:27:40-1:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:40):**  an electronic sniffer uh and so we started reading about it and and and and and thinking about it  
**[1:27:47-1:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:47):**  doing some other studies and what i have come back with is this concept of high carbon use efficiency  
**[1:27:53-1:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:53):**  low carbon use efficiency organisms they were placed long before i started to take a look at  
**[1:27:58-1:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:58):**  this i think the folks that i've you know talked about earlier have really done some remarkable  
**[1:28:02-1:28:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  work and so if you have the wrong population of microbes you're going to get a net respiration  
**[1:28:09-1:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:09):**  if you have the right population of microbes you're going to have net sequestration and generally  
**[1:28:14-1:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:14):**  people consider that right population of microbes for net sequestration to be fungal dominant or at  
**[1:28:20-1:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:20):**  least high carbon use efficiency dominant organisms right so that carbon's going into like their  
**[1:28:26-1:28:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:26):**  hyphae and the mycelium which are expanding out which the above ground example is a tree right  
**[1:28:31-1:28:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:31):**  like absorbing all that carbon in they put it in the wood that wood's not going anywhere till  
**[1:28:37-1:28:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:37):**  eventually one day it does we're underground so if you can keep getting these fungal hyphae growing  
**[1:28:43-1:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:43):**  longer and longer spreading out further and further that's where you're storing all this  
**[1:28:47-1:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:47):**  carbon right that's that's not a good analogy but you know there's c3 versus c4 uh photosynthesis  
**[1:28:53-1:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:53):**  plants a c3 plant will respire there's photo respiration you know at night plants respire co2  
**[1:29:01-1:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:01):**  well c4 plant has a malic acid pathway well they'll capture one of those co2s and put it  
**[1:29:05-1:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:05):**  into a c4 a four carbon molecule to keep it from escaping and they're a little bit more  
**[1:29:10-1:29:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:10):**  photosynthetically efficient because of that so the same thing down below that you know uh  
**[1:29:15-1:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:15):**  nature adhors a uh you know inefficiency so those microbes become very important therefore it  
**[1:29:22-1:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:22):**  becomes very important to do those things necessary from a agricultural practice perspective  
**[1:29:27-1:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:27):**  to just try to create a more fungal dominant or at least high cue dominant soil so that you can  
**[1:29:34-1:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:34):**  aggregate or accumulate carbon as opposed to degrade it and respire outside your wheelhouse  
**[1:29:42-1:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:42):**  but are you aware of any soil microbes that absorb large amounts of co2 so if you have ones that are  
**[1:29:52-1:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:52):**  taking it in yet respiring it off i'm thinking okay well again there's got to be this natural  
**[1:29:58-1:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:58):**  balance what's sucking that extra co2 up in the soil are there microbes that are co2 feeders well  
**[1:30:05-1:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:05):**  i would never say no uh but you're right it's a little bit outside my wheelhouse i'm not aware of  
**[1:30:10-1:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:10):**  one there are chemical processes like uh calcium carbonate you know you know rock formation that  
**[1:30:18-1:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:18):**  will geologically capture carbon but off the top of my head and i'll i'll look into it and i'll  
**[1:30:26-1:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:26):**  email you if i find something but this particular point in time you know i can't off the top of my  
**[1:30:31-1:30:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:31):**  head give give an example of a microbe that's doing that other well i take that back oh is  
**[1:30:37-1:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:37):**  that blue green algae you know cyanobacteria they definitely would be an example of that  
**[1:30:43-1:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:43):**  they have photosynthetic apparatus uh their soil dwelling and they certainly would would consume co2  
**[1:30:50-1:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:50):**  have a degree of archaic photosynthesis and convert that what i don't know is what their  
**[1:30:56-1:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:56):**  carbon use efficiency would be right no there we go i feel proud of myself like  
**[1:31:03-1:31:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:03):**  a brain cell clicked right well there's somebody referenced on a past podcast i can't remember who  
**[1:31:07-1:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:07):**  it was but they said something along the lines of of part of what's helping plant growth is that co2  
**[1:31:15-1:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:15):**  is that co2 respired from microbes in the soil as it comes back yeah i you know i have a good friend  
**[1:31:25-1:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:25):**  tony michaels that i worked with at pegasus capital advisors and i worked with in hawaii  
**[1:31:29-1:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:29):**  and he actually was the ceo of midwestern bioag and tony always felt as though when you have a  
**[1:31:36-1:31:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:36):**  a good canopy like say soybeans or corn and you had a and you had a higher co2 density  
**[1:31:43-1:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:43):**  under the canopy than above it because of that soil respiration you are going to get greater yield  
**[1:31:51-1:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:51):**  i i don't know if i buy that or not it makes sense right uh but i guess you know it's a matter of  
**[1:31:59-1:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:59):**  equilibrium constants and to me especially now that we're beginning to monetize soil carbon for  
**[1:32:05-1:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:05):**  growers i i think keeping as much carbon in the ground is more important than trying to boost your  
**[1:32:11-1:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:11):**  yields by a few percentage points by by creating a not that tony was suggesting this he's going to  
**[1:32:18-1:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:18):**  slap me silly if he listens to this uh that tony was suggesting that okay you need to to prime the  
**[1:32:25-1:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:25):**  soil to to do nothing but but you know respire co2 yeah but i think it's an it's an economic  
**[1:32:32-1:32:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:32):**  trade-off and and you know at 15 a ton and you know the wonders of common farm and you know  
**[1:32:39-1:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:39):**  you know our ability to truly monetize this as you know we we we actually were able to organize  
**[1:32:46-1:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:46):**  a payment from spotify to one of our growers a couple of weeks ago and i think it's a sea change  
**[1:32:51-1:32:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:51):**  i think we're going to be able to to further incentivize growers to adopt regenerative practices  
**[1:32:56-1:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:56):**  because it's going to create a second crop crop for them carbon yeah can you have a little bit  
**[1:33:01-1:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:01):**  about that because that's this is something i think we're we're just really getting into the  
**[1:33:06-1:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:06):**  brink of out there is an industry and i'll go back to an interview i did with joel salatin back in  
**[1:33:11-1:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:11):**  like 2013 and he talked about you know wouldn't it be great you know on the wall street journal  
**[1:33:17-1:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:17):**  if it said you know like the total number of earthworms per cubic foot of soil versus what  
**[1:33:22-1:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:22):**  the dow did and we're kind of getting here in a way right with the amount of carbon sequestered  
**[1:33:29-1:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:29):**  can you talk about where that industry is right now with farmers and companies looking to offset  
**[1:33:39-1:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:39):**  carbon emissions where's that intersection what's that industry look like and where do you think it's  
**[1:33:44-1:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44):**  going right okay so uh i always start with talking about ratan law you know the professor at ohio  
**[1:33:50-1:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:50):**  state university uh won the food prize this year and the japan prize last year for his work on soil  
**[1:33:56-1:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:56):**  carbon he he is the father of a lot of these principles many many other people globally working  
**[1:34:01-1:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:01):**  on this but he's a good person to quote in particular that he you know he estimated that  
**[1:34:06-1:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:06):**  agricultural soils globally have lost about 1.35 billion tons of carbon over the last hundred years  
**[1:34:12-1:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:12):**  120 years and then if all we did was put that back the calculation is that that would be worth 65  
**[1:34:20-1:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:20):**  parts million of co2 in the atmosphere so 415 to uh uh what is that 350 that's a big deal right  
**[1:34:30-1:34:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:30):**  now a lot of people will say well look you can only pack so much carbon  
**[1:34:34-1:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:34):**  in a in a in the soil you can't put 10 pounds of manure in a five-pound bag  
**[1:34:39-1:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:39):**  well number one i think we're a long way from getting to that point and that agricultural  
**[1:34:45-1:34:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:45):**  soils represent the world's most scalable solution to climate mitigation and oh by the way  
**[1:34:52-1:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:52):**  putting carbon in soil is a good deal unlike carbon being absorbed into the the ocean where  
**[1:34:56-1:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:56):**  it destroys productivity increased carbon in agricultural soils increases productivity it's  
**[1:35:02-1:35:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:02):**  a good thing for lots of different reasons now on the flip side of this you see every week another  
**[1:35:07-1:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:07):**  company committing to be carbon neutral by 2030 2040 2050 are committing billions of dollars to to  
**[1:35:15-1:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:15):**  to stimulate this and there are lots of groups the carbon underground soil health institute you know  
**[1:35:22-1:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:22):**  many organizations that we could name that are dedicated to to improving this um and what is  
**[1:35:34-1:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:34):**  important i think and i've worked on policy i'm a member of a group called e2 the environmental

**[1:35:43-1:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:43):**  of a small group that that went to the senate ag committee in 2017 and and we're with the national  
**[1:35:51-1:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:51):**  corn growers and myself there about six of us and we've talked to folks about getting language in  
**[1:35:57-1:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:57):**  the farm bill to incentivize soil health and we along with other people that were promoting that  
**[1:36:04-1:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:04):**  were successful you see language in that and it provides funds through you know conservation  
**[1:36:09-1:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:09):**  service and other usda programs for people to embrace and study and adopt regenerative  
**[1:36:15-1:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:15):**  soil practices because we understand one of the best ways of increasing soil carbon is to  
**[1:36:20-1:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:20):**  implement these regenerative practices but what really you know i think incentivizing people uh  
**[1:36:28-1:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:28):**  you know works really well and that if if there were marketplaces and there are now we work with  
**[1:36:34-1:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:34):**  nori which is a carbon marketplace which works with spotify as an excuse me shopify which is the

**[1:36:52-1:36:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:52):**  or i can shut off the lights in our building or put in leds as opposed to incandescent you know

**[1:37:01-1:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:01):**  or even carbon negative you've got to have drawdown and agricultural soils are the best

**[1:37:15-1:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:15):**  they're doing by paying them uh for the carbon that they're putting in soil and so there are

**[1:37:40-1:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:40):**  that is creating a marketplace which is bringing interested buyers together with validated sellers

**[1:38:01-1:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:01):**  nutrient tillage practices all kinds of things that the grower fills out into a platform and  
**[1:38:07-1:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:07):**  then that metadata base uses artificial intelligence to project the amount of carbon  
**[1:38:12-1:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:12):**  that's sequestered versus if they had not been doing those things and of course it has to be

**[1:38:59-1:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:59):**  there are other programs out there for them to look into where they can now begin to think about  
**[1:39:06-1:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:06):**  their their farm economics not only about optimizing yield and quality but optimizing

**[1:39:23-1:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:23):**  carbon sequestration especially if if it's accomplished with a variety of regenerative  
**[1:39:28-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:28):**  agricultural practices which in the end is what we're doing because that's what built soil health  
**[1:39:33-1:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:33):**  and soil health is what keeps the whole system sustainable that we'll have  
**[1:39:38-1:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:38):**  we'll have healthy soils or increased soils as opposed to diminished soils over the next

**[1:39:59-1:40:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:59):**  only have 60 years of harvest left and then the soil is going to be gone well that's a scary  
**[1:40:04-1:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:04):**  number right i i i i think we can we can slow that down i think we can reverse it i think we can  
**[1:40:10-1:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:10):**  build it back the other way i think we can grow soil as ray archuleta says in that same film by  
**[1:40:16-1:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:16):**  these things and i think the best way to stimulate the speed at which that happens is to incentivize  
**[1:40:20-1:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:20):**  growers by you know rewarding them for the carbon they put in the ground and that's happening right  
**[1:40:26-1:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:26):**  now and i think our carbon now program is a great example of that is this the pendulum then that  
**[1:40:32-1:40:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:32):**  that starts to swing where that starts to swing the other way before i i think a lot of conventional  
**[1:40:38-1:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:38):**  ag farmers maybe felt trapped for lack of a better word as well i could do other practices but i'm  
**[1:40:46-1:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:46):**  trying to pay the bills you know i switch off i i'm going to take a hit on yield during this  
**[1:40:52-1:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:52):**  transition where if you're now have the ability to start getting paid for sequestering that carbon  
**[1:41:01-1:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:01):**  to a different method does this ease some of that land tradition moving over the adoption of  
**[1:41:09-1:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:09):**  different practices you know as it said i've you know i graduated you know from college in 1976  
**[1:41:15-1:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:15):**  i grew up on a farm i graduated with my phd in 1980 that's a long time ago i would still repeat  
**[1:41:22-1:41:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:22):**  the same thing i told you before you know i worked on you know conservation tillage practices in

**[1:41:32-1:41:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:32):**  on that trash farming i talked about i just i just don't buy into the fact that growers you know  
**[1:41:37-1:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:37):**  consciously made decisions to optimize yield over soil health i mean a lot of those people went

**[1:41:58-1:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:58):**  especially with the ability to monetize carbon sequestration we're going to see even more rapid

**[1:44:12-1:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:12):**  think we're we're close to a day where any farmer regardless of scale will be able to have access to

**[1:45:40-1:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:40):**  Indian growers are already there they already do a lot a lot of cover crops and and composting and

**[1:45:55-1:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:55):**  right now you know with the concept of additionality on soil carbon sequestration for example in in in  
**[1:46:02-1:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-13-PaulZorner-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:02):**  the the uh nori program if you've been doing it for more than 10 years you you're disqualified

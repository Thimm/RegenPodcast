**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Compost tea.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  What is it and is it as valuable as people claim it to be?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  When you look at farming and gardening, one thing that gets consistently hyped to the  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  absolute max is compost tea.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  It's promoted as a panacea, a cure-all, a be-all, end-all that can do so many miracle  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  things to plants.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  Yet is it true?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  Today we're going to try and answer that question and many more.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  To do that, I'm being joined by my guest, Troy Hinke.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  My experience and what I've heard from other people is that normally their first application  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  of compost tea, they will notice possibly a drastic difference or some slight variations  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  that they can notice.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  But then upon further applications of teas, there won't be as drastic of a difference.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:13):**  Troy is somebody who's worked with Dr. Elaine Ingram, he's worked at the Rodale Institute,  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  and now he runs a biological consulting and services firm called Living Roots Compost  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  Tea.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  Today we're going to take compost tea and try and bubble off most of the hype and try  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  and distill it down to reality.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  What can you actually use compost tea for?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  Why is it beneficial and how can you make it?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:37):**  If you enjoy this episode and you want to learn more about compost tea, then be sure  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:42):**  to check out Troy's brand new podcast series called What's Brewing?  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  That show debuts this Friday and I'll link to that below.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  Now let's jump right into it with Troy Hinke of Living Roots Compost Tea.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  And Troy, one of the things I wanted to start out with is this topic that keeps coming up  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  over and over in a lot of the interviews and people I talk to is around compost and it  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  involves the quality of compost.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  How can somebody who makes their own compost, purchases in their own compost, evaluate the  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  quality of that when they want to use it either as compost or in a tea, which we'll eventually  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  get to in this interview?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:28):**  Right.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  I mean, the best way is going to be with a microscope.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  I understand that most people are not going to have a microscope, but I focused strictly  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  on the biology in compost and compost tea soils.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:45):**  Any compost that I'm looking at, I'm trying to see, has it got good bacteria, good fungi,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  nematodes, protozoa, and wanting to see quality-wise just strictly on the biology.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  So to me, a good compost is going to have all characters of the soil food web.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  I mean, just kind of using your naked eye when you're looking at a compost from a compost  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  facility, I would say just in general, most large-scale compost facilities are not necessarily  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  going to be making that great of compost because they're focusing on waste reduction more than  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  a quality compost.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  They're trying to focus on taking a waste product and breaking it down for someone on  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  a super large scale and when you're on that large of a scale, it's kind of hard to focus  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  on quality.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  I'm not saying that everyone doesn't focus on quality.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  I just haven't come across many companies that are very large that make great compost  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  biologically speaking.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  But if you get a compost, you want to be looking for various degrees of decomposition in the  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  material.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  There may be some wood chips, but you have to think of those wood chips if you've got  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  good biology there.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  They're going to be like a slow release fertilizer because they're going to be broken down over  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:17):**  time and bacteria and fungi are going to eat away at it.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:21):**  They're going to hold those microorganisms, hold the nutrients inside themselves until  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  a predator comes along and eats them or they die and are then made available.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  The nutrients inside of them are then made available to plants to take up the nutrients.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  So if you notice you've got a compost with a lot of chunks in it, then it either hasn't  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  fully gone through the composting process or there may not be a lot of good biology  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  there to be breaking it down.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  It's really hard to tell what the naked eye is, but I usually look for signs in my own  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  piles of are things turning into humus more quickly?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  Have I got mycelium from saprophytic fungi on different pieces of wood chunks that are  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  in there?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:13):**  So for people who aren't familiar with what mycelium looks like, if you ever go for a  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  hike in the forest and you lift up some of the leaf litter or some sticks or something  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  like that and you see white strands on the bottom of a stick or leaves, that's mycelium  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  and it's from saprophytic fungi, which is fungi that breaks down dead or decaying matter.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  So in your compost pile, if you notice these mycelium, you know that you've got good fungi  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  going in there and you should have some good bacteria going in there.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  It's a matter of having all the characters though because if we do have just bacteria  
**[0:05:52-0:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  and fungi in a soil or in compost without getting into a lengthy explanation, they are  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:00):**  the first decomposers.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  So on mainly green, easy to consume tissues, bacteria are going to consume those and then  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  more brown woody tissue, fungi is going to feed on those.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  If you've got bacteria and fungi, you've got those things broken down, but all those nutrients  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  from that organic matter are then held in the bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  But in order to get those nutrients and minerals to plants and into soils, we need their predators  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  to come along and be able to eat them and release those nutrients in a plant available  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  form.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  So that's the reason we need all the characters, not just bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  So we need to focus on building up all characters of the food web.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  I think one misconception around compost or really any amendments is the plant is going  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  in and mining nutrients out of those amendments.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  The root is tapping into that compost and absorbing some.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  I think there probably is some liquid transfer there.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  If water goes down and leaches through, it's going to absorb that into the root.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  But really the function of this compost, these amendments are you are feeding the organisms.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  The organisms are consuming that compost.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  They're then consuming each other and that poop, the excrement and the dead bodies is  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  what the plant can access.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  Correct.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  So for billions of years before humans were around on planet earth, plants and microorganisms

**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  So if you, as humans, if we want to make friends, was one of the ways that we make friends.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  We invite people over for food or go out to eat with someone.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:11):**  So plants put out food to bring in microorganisms and then it's a matter of that symbiotic relationship  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:17):**  of the microorganisms being present in the rhizosphere then.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  So then when they are consumed, the plant is able to take up those nutrients.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  And the chemistry behind the plant taking up the nutrients is a bit beyond my knowledge.

**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  One thing you mentioned is a lot of times in municipalities, the goal is reduction of

**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:48):**  on quality.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  Somebody could also do that on a home scale.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:53):**  They might just be doing a composting method that's moving things along too fast and not  
**[0:08:58-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  allowing the diversity of organisms and the population of that diversity to really proliferate.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  Where's a mistake of large scale composting that we want to make sure we avoid on the  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  small scale to end up with a quality product?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:17):**  Well usually with a large scale compost facility, they've got so much real estate that they  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:22):**  can use that they're trying to make compost on and they're trying to make compost and  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  get it out the door to make money.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  So they need that land to be able to make more compost.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:32):**  So normally in my experience from things I've seen, experience with people like getting  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  compost deliveries and stuff like that, you can see on Instagram somebody gets a large  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  delivery of compost and they're super excited but you see it steaming.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  Well if the compost is steaming, it's obviously hotter than the air temperature and compost  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  is finished when it's at ambient temperature.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  So whatever the temperature is outside, it should be close to that within like 20 degrees  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  or so.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  So the issue is that larger facilities are, it's not that they're getting it to break  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  down too fast, it's that they're composting it but then getting out the door before it's  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  actually aged and matured.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:21):**  So you've still got hot compost that's breaking down and it has the potential to harm plants  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  if you were to not dilute it down into a potting soil or something like that and it still could  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  cause issues then possibly.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  But yeah, the main issue with large scale facilities is that and then whatever starting  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  materials that they're using may have some detrimental effects because they might just  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:49):**  kind of be throwing anything in there.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  On a home scale, so to kind of compare that to a home scale, it's really a matter of getting  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  a good mixture of feedstock.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  So whatever you're putting into your compost pile, you want to have a good diversity of  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:06):**  that so you're getting a good diversity of microorganisms.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  You know, you're gonna have certain microorganisms on a banana peel, certain microorganisms on  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  a piece of lettuce, other types of microorganisms and species on a stick and a leaf.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:20):**  So it's a matter of getting a diversity of that in your compost pile at home.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  And then focusing on the management.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  So like when I was working at Rodale with Elaine, we were trying to set the organic  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  regulations to meet organic regulations for compost, you have to turn five times within  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  15 days and maintain a temperature over 131 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  Well, with that management practice, you know, you could have someone who goes out and is  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:58):**  checking their temperatures every day but they might be lazy or they might be too busy  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  to turn a pile or it might have rained and they can't get out into a muddy area where  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  they're able to turn their compost.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  And then they're turning five times, you know, the last five days of the 15 days that they're  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  maintaining those high temps, they're turning once every day.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:23):**  So we were focusing on at Rodale, we were working on trying a turning according to temperature,  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:31):**  where your management practices are focused on the biology rather than just meeting regulations.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  So like turning according to temperature, you don't want to get above 161 degrees because  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  at 160 degrees, I don't know why I said 160 degrees or 165 and higher, the heat is coming  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  from microorganisms that are reproducing and eating.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  So just like when we eat and reproduce, we create heat, that's where the heat in the  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:04):**  pile comes from.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:05):**  So when you're at 160 degrees, you've got a lot going on, you know, biology-wise in  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  a pile.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  And at that point, the oxygen is being used up at such a rapid rate that the pile is going  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  to most likely go anaerobic on the inside.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  And once you go anaerobic, you get anaerobic microorganisms which could start creating  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  phenols and alcohols and things that are going to be detrimental to plants.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  So when we're turning according to temperature, we want to get up above 131 degrees and then  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  turn if you were to hit 160, 165 degrees to get air back into that material.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  Or if you notice a drop in temperature, if you were maintaining 145 degrees for like  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  three days or so, that's just an example.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  So then the next day you come out and you're at 135 or 130 degrees, something's going on  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  inside that pile where anaerobic microorganisms have most likely started to take over and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:10):**  you really need to get air in there.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  So when we're focusing on the biology, we're really looking at temperatures and moisture  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:17):**  levels too.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  So making sure that a pile isn't getting too wet and maintaining 50% moisture.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  I like to compare composting to food preservation.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  So as humans, we use salts, dehydration and airtight containers to basically keep microorganisms  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:42):**  at bay.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  So if you've got food, the first things that come in and eat it are bacteria and mold,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  which is a type of fungi.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  And as humans, we're trying to preserve that food so we dehydrate things, we take all the  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  moisture out of there so that the microorganisms aren't able to break it down or we keep it  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  in airtight containers away from where air oxidants going to get to it and help those  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  microorganisms to break it down.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  So in the opposite sense, when we want to enhance microbial populations, we need to  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:13):**  really be focusing on moisture.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  So these microorganisms that I'm talking about live in little microfilms on the surfaces

**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30):**  of a wrung out sponge, so that we're able to provide a beneficial habitat for microorganisms  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  that are going to thrive and succeed in breaking down these microorganisms.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  And that also involves, they need oxygen and moisture.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  So that's why it's important to incorporate both of those.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  Lately I've been doing a lot of reasoning and kind of fallen into this school of cold  
**[0:15:56-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  composting where you are trying to employ the biological activity of fungi over bacteria.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  So you leave the pile more passive, you're not turning as much, you're not concerned  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  with temperature.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  And if we remove the regulatory aspect out of it, like for some people that doesn't matter  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  on a garden scale.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  Is there some validity to that, that if I maintain a pile with less turning, I'm enacting  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:27):**  fungi more in the decomposition process and potentially preserving more carbon in the  
**[0:16:33-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  soil because there's less aerobic activity, which would then send carbon up into the atmosphere  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  as a byproduct of that aerobic activity?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  You are correct in that.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  It's not just cold composting though.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:52):**  It's been a while, I need to get it going again, but I ran an experiment on aerated  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  static piles.

**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:58):**  ASP?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:59):**  Right, forced air system.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  So you've got pipes laid on the ground that you, I don't know if you can see my fingers,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  but you would put material on the pipes like this and stack it up and then you're forcing  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:09):**  air up through that.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  And through my experiment with that, I had great results getting fungi going in the pile  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  because I'm not turning it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:19):**  So yes, the whole deal with fungi and my whole mission since I started making compost and  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  doing what I'm doing is to get more fungal compost and get more fungi into the soil through  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  our conventional agriculture practices like using a tractor or having heavy machinery  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:41):**  on the soil that causes compaction or especially tillage.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  A lot of people think that every spring they need to go out and take their tiller out and  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  rip up the soil.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  So when I was talking before about that saprophytic fungi and seeing saprophytic fungi in the  
**[0:17:55-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  forest, when you notice that it looks like strings on a stick or on leaves and that's  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  what's visible to our naked eye, but most of these things that I'm talking about aren't  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:08):**  visible to our naked eye.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  So there's lots of things in the soil that we're not seeing and there's tons of thread  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  just miles normally in a healthy, especially in a forest system in a healthy soil, there's  
**[0:18:18-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  miles of fungi underfoot that if you were to come through with a tiller or in this,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  you're talking about compost if we're getting this saprophytic fungi and these mycelium  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  going throughout the pile, if you come through and turn that, you're ripping up all those  
**[0:18:34-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  threads and setting the stage back a lot earlier to where there's more bacteria that are going  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  to thrive and that fungi needs more time to get going again.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  So it's provide the oxygen, but don't break up that network.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  And with cold composting, most people in their backyard are going to throw, they mow their  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  lawn and maybe they collect some of the grass clippings, they're going to throw those in  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  a pile and then in the fall or in the end of summer they might have a garden and they're  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:07):**  throwing some of those scraps on there and then in the fall they're throwing leaves in  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  there and sticks and things like that.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  And if you're not turning that, it's most likely going to go through an anaerobic process  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  because it doesn't have air in there, but if you leave it long enough, aerobic microorganisms  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:25):**  are going to take over and you will have good compost in the end and hopefully have good  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  fungi in there too because you haven't turned it.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  But it's a matter of letting it age and mature like a year or a year and a half and most  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  people are wanting compost a lot quicker than that and not wanting to have to wait around.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah, I mean the more I read on this, I think that's the trade-off.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  People are rushing it and I think they're giving up a lot of the value in that compost.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:57):**  Like it's as though we say, well it's better to have it on the soil now at a five than  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  it is to wait for it for another 12 months and put it on the soil where maybe the effect  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  on the soil is I'm making this up a 50 versus a five because those organisms have diversified,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  they've matured, there's more of them.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:19):**  You're just adding better quality, more concentrated stuff to the soil versus adding something  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  that's good but it's just quick.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:29):**  Right.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  Yes, I totally agree.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  And in that sense, to me, if someone were to know to look at the biology of a compost  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  and maybe got a sample, like they have a local municipal compost and they got a little sample  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  and were able to look at it with a microscope and say it was a five like you talked about,  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  well they're going to have to spend more to pay for twice as much compost or whatever  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  to get it down to get the same effects as if you were to let a compost age a little  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  bit longer and then use less and have better biology on your soil.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  I noticed on your Instagram page that you had started a Johnson-Sue reactor.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  So David Johnson had found out through his research that one ton of compost applied on  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  an acre of land will get results.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  He's got fungal dominant compost.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  He's applying that at one ton per acre which it's really hard to fathom one ton per acre.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  I mean that's like probably two to three cubic yards of compost.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  You're probably not even going to be able to see that as you apply that down at that  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  rate.

**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:46):**  Through his research, according to his research, he got effects where he had an effect on the  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:51):**  biology in the soil then and was able to get more fungi going in the soil with just one  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  ton of compost.

**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  still pretty minimal.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:06):**  Isn't it all going to this fungal dominated compost anyway?  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  So if we take that fungal dominated coal compost pile and it takes 18 months and we just let  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:16):**  it sit there and then we apply that, it's kind of as broken down as it's going to get.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  It's in its base nutrients at that point.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  Where if we take more raw compost after let's say 45 days of turning, we add that to the  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  soil.

**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  who's still been tilling and are organic, they may have been suppressing that fungi  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  for so long or breaking it up that they don't really have much fungi in the soil.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  And if you take a compost that's half aged or whatever, you're most likely not going

**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:38):**  You're better culturing it all out in one place where it's hyper concentrated in the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:42):**  perfect environment, building up the soil population by introducing that, then assuming  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  that there's enough biology in the soil that can take care of the more raw ingredients

**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  we really need to be feeding the soil.

**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  that it's not about feeding the plant, it's about feeding the soil, giving the soil what  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:11):**  it needs and then the soil is going to have interactions with the plant for the plant  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  to manage its own nutrient needs and feed itself.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  So yeah with that, putting compost down on something that already has good biology in  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  the soil is just helping to add more organic matter to it that's going to be foods for

**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  more of a mulch compost that doesn't have as great microorganisms, microbial populations  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  in there.

**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  how hard is it to do with a microscope and what's involved?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  What's the cost of a basic microscope to do that?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  I know there's classes online at places like Soil Food where you can learn to do it.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  I don't think we can't go into all the details because it's very visual thing of what it  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  takes but how easy and costly is that to do?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:17):**  You can get a microscope for it's gone up a little bit it's $315 or $320.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  Microscopenet.com has a the brand that they normally have is an OMAX microscope.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  To get specifically if you want to look it up it's the model M8311 I believe.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  I've had to look it up a lot of times.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  But yeah that's $315 to be able to assess your own soils.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:48):**  To be able to get the biomass of the fungi or bacteria in the soil or any other microorganisms  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:56):**  you'd have to set up a spreadsheet.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:57):**  I've got a spreadsheet that Elaine's continually updated a spreadsheet that she has and I've  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  got one of the ones that she's put out in the past.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  It has functions in each cell that take into consideration the number of views per cover  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  slip and things like that to be able to do the algebra and everything that you need to  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  figure out what your biomass is going to be in from looking at one drop of compost or  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  soil or whatever.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:32):**  So then I mean it's a matter of being able to identify the microorganisms that you're  
**[0:26:37-0:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  looking at which really most people are asking me about that and from my own experience it's  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:46):**  a matter of knowing what not to look at.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  So when I'm looking through a sample I'm looking first I scan for nematodes so I'm mainly looking  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:57):**  for movement from I'm looking for like a snake or worm like shape that's really moving or  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  maybe staying still.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:06):**  And then as I'm focusing in more I'm looking for fungi and protozoa which is going to be  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:12):**  like testate amoeba, flagellates and it's a matter of knowing what their movements are  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  and shapes and kind of sizes to know what you're looking at and everything else.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:24):**  You don't want to necessarily ignore it but there's a lot of things that you can ignore  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  where most beginners who are using a microscope they see all these shapes and they're like  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:37):**  oh that's so cool and it's like yeah that's a piece of mineral like we don't it's good  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  that it's there but we don't really need to focus on it so it's really a matter of like  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  knowing how to identify things what you're looking at and just spending a lot of time  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  at the microscope to be able to do that.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  So you would have to most likely take at least one class to you know get to learn how to  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  identify microorganisms and then also like I said you have to have a way of calculating  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  the biomass of what you're looking at and plugging it into a spreadsheet or whatever  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  to get the accurate biomass of like fungal to bacterial ratio and how much you have of  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  everything.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:18):**  And it's really not that costly so you're let's say you're a thousand dollars into it  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  by the time you take the class you buy the microscope I mean that that sounds like a  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:25):**  lot but you own that knowledge forever you own that microscope forever and some farms  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  are buying 10, 20, 30 yards of compost a year at 30 bucks a yard.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:36):**  So you know what do you actually buying and can you see a situation where farm or maybe  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  you know of situations where farmers are over applying poor quality compost and they could  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  get away with applying a lot less of better quality compost?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:59):**  I think it's totally worth it to spend a little bit more money if you have to to get a better  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  quality compost that's focused on the biology in there.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  It's basically an inoculant is what you can consider compost when you're putting it on  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:12):**  the soil.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  You're manipulating the soil with good biology.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  And so if you have something that's not a good inoculant like you want to bake a cake  
**[0:29:23-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  and you buy the yeast to bake the cake but the yeast is dead what good does it do you?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  But you know you need that live yeast.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  That yeast is going to be an inoculant in your cake basically to get going.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  And so when we consider compost an inoculant I think people can grasp the concept a lot  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  better than it's not providing it is providing nutrients but it's not it shouldn't be considered  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  like a fertilizer it can should be considered an inoculant more in my opinion.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  Given that this is another question that's been on my mind for a long time.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  Is there an upper limit to the amount of these organisms that you can apply or is there a  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  law of diminishing returns?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  Obviously these are organisms that self-regulate their population based on their food supply.

**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  tea it just you're not getting as much of a bump each time because in a certain point

**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  as you can cram into that soil and just doing more because it makes us feel better might  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:42):**  not actually be doing anything for the soil and you might be wasting time and money.

**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  soil for people who haven't ever heard of succession if you if you Google a picture  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  of plant succession or succession in soils at the very beginning stage of succession  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  or if we were to take a piece of just even like a three by three little piece of land  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:14):**  and take all the vegetation away and then let it go at first you're going to get some  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  pioneer weeds you know dandelions plantains things like that and then you're going to  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  get some grasses after that and then maybe next year or in a couple years you're going  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  to get brambles and bushes that come up and if you leave it for 10, 15, 20 years you're  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  going to have a forest eventually come up you know coniferous deciduous forest so as

**[0:31:43-0:31:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:43):**  of succession the soil there is bacterial dominant and then as we move into like bushes  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:54):**  tall grasses row crops that we grow a lot that's going to be what has been found to

**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  systems we have the same amount of bacteria but we have way way way more fungi in the

**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  with that as we talked about when you're tilling and breaking up this fungal hyphae or using  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  chemicals to kill weeds you are also having a detrimental effect you're having a detrimental  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:33):**  effect on everything in the soil but you're setting yourself back in succession so you  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:37):**  till that land to get rid of weeds but then you set yourself back at the beginning stage  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:42):**  of succession and what's the plants that come up because of that bacterial dominance you've  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  got weeds coming up and so with that if you've got a bacterial an extremely bacterial compost  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  that you're applying to land and feeding a whole lot of bacteria but then you don't have  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  their predators to come in and eat them you have these pulses of bacteria that are just  
**[0:33:04-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  going to keep creating weeds and keep creating weeds also with the talk I said about succession  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  we it depends on what plant you're trying to grow so you know someone who's got just  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:19):**  an apple orchard or a nursery or who is trying to focus on trees they're going to want to  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  use a compost that is fungal dominant or they're trying to get more fungi going in their soils  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:29):**  with the trees where someone who's growing lettuce doesn't really want much fungi so  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  depending on what plant you're growing and where that plant lies in succession succession  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:42):**  has to do with the amount of bacteria to fungi in the soil and ratio of that so it all depends  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  on what kind of plant you're trying to grow or plants you're trying to grow as to how  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  much biology you need in the soil does that explain it well it does and it's kind of echoes  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  what I thought I watched the video with Dr. Elaine this morning and she kind of talked  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:03):**  a little bit about that and it's just echoes a lot of what you're saying given that we're  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:09):**  growing vegetables and this fungi to bacteria ratio is around one to one weeds or I forget  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  the number but it was something like a hundred to one in favor of bacteria and you go to  
**[0:34:19-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  a forest and it's like a thousand to one could could people who are into this wood chip gardening  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  be potentially setting themselves up for failure if they're growing vegetables because at some  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  point that one to one ratio goes too much in favor of fungi which is for these higher  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  order species not what you're trying to grow in a vegetable garden and your soils out of  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  whack for vegetables where because you're providing that food source for fungi to break  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:54):**  down all these wood chips fungi can have a field day you can get this proliferation of  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:59):**  fungi if you remove the wood chips and you just have compost being applied you leave  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  say root mass in the soil I don't feel like and I might be wrong on this that you're introducing  
**[0:35:13-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  as much food for fungi so that balance stays closer to that one to one you're absolutely  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  correct yeah so as I mentioned before in a compost pile more green material is going  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  to be food for bacteria and more brown woody material is going to be food for fungi and  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  so by yes by using wood chips in your garden you're promoting fungi or you're likely promoting  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  fungi and so yeah when I see you'll notice that people who grow lettuce and use wood  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  chips as a mulch or have issues even kind of from the beginning another part of it has  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  to do with and again I don't have a chemistry background so I'm not able to explain it fully  
**[0:35:59-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:59):**  but the nitrogen cycle so when you've got bacteria breaking down organic matter for  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  and helping to release those nutrients for plants they're producing more nitrate and  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  when you get more fungi in the system you're working with more perennial type stuff and  
**[0:36:23-0:36:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  you get more the form of nitrogen is ammonium so  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:35):**  plants that are in the later stages of succession are going to be working with fungi more and  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  using more of the ammonium form of nitrogen and plants in the earlier stages of succession  
**[0:36:48-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  are going to be using more the nitrate form of nitrogen the nitrates put out bacteria  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  more and the ammoniums put out by fungi more and so it's a matter of what you're getting  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  from that by that what's being released from that from that biology so to really recap  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:12):**  everything we've talked about so far in the first 40 minutes we've we've established that  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  you want compost that's fungal rich so you're going to need to create build that pile with  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  food sources for fungi in addition to bacteria so if you're just using all vegetable waste  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  without a woody component you would probably have less fungi you're going to have less  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  fungal you're going to have nasty compost if you've ever seen anyone who's just like  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  put food waste in a bucket trying to compost their food waste it turns into a slimy nasty  
**[0:37:52-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:52):**  mess you need it yeah you need brown material for for a number of reasons that's the chemistry  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  between browns and greens going together is what really sets off the composting process  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  more where you're getting that action from the microbes that's increasing heat and things  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  like that yes it does happen in wood chips and things like that but that's composting  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  so but yeah you need you need brown woody stuff for for several reasons in a compost  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  pile you want it to help add foods for fungi but the brown woody material is also what's  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  going to give some structure to the compost pile so in that same sense you want different  
**[0:38:40-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:40):**  sizes of material when you're building a compost pile you know if you when you put something  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:48):**  in a blender and you or chop something up very small you're creating that much more  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  surface area which you would think would make sense if you're creating that much more surface  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  area you get more microbes that could move on to the surfaces right you get where I'm

**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:11):**  got tons of surface area for microorganisms to break down but there's there's gonna be

**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  compost pile if you're using food waste you want to mix some leaves in there maybe some  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:30):**  straw some wood chips so the wood chips are going to be some nice fluff where it'll help  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:35):**  give it little pockets of air where where moisture can move in the same as with soil

**[0:39:50-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  pile so we want a variety of not only a diversity of plants and stuff going into the pile but  
**[0:39:57-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  we want to different sizes of things but yeah again you asked about so me personally I'm  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  trying to get more fungi going in any pile because most soils that that we come across  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  are degraded and need more fungi so it's been my goal to always increase fungi but if someone  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  were a lettuce farmer you know they're not going to necessarily want to make compost  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:22):**  that's heavy and fungi because they're they're just growing lettuce and they don't need that  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  much fungi anyway so they do need some brown material and it's a matter of when you get  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  into that it's a matter of the ratio of ingredients in your compost pile so you'll hear different  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  people thought mention different things and I think on average you would people would  
**[0:40:46-0:40:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  say what I hear or read is 50% browns to 50% greens or two-thirds browns to one-third green  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:56):**  somewhere in between there but yeah in the sense that I was talking about green stuff  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  is food for bacteria brown stuff is food for fungi if you're trying to get a more bacterial  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  dominant pile or trying to get more fungi going then you'd want to have your ratio and  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  your pile have more green than brown stuff or if you're trying to get more fungi you're  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  going to want more brown and green stuff and it does come to a point where you can get  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  you can skip tip the scale too far either way like if you've got 90% brown material  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:30):**  in your compost pile and 10% green you're going to get compost but it's going to take  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  a really long time because you've got a lot of energy stored in that carbon from the wood  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  that needs to break down and it's going to take a really long time in the same sense  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  when you have too much green that's what I mentioned before you don't have enough brown  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:47):**  then you just get a pile of slop you don't get any there's really no consistency to it  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  or the consistency is slop there's no structure to it is what I meant to say where it just  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  doesn't turn out as good compost good quality compost so yeah in that sense to give people  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  some instruction if you were going to go if you're trying to build a fungal dot more fungal  
**[0:42:09-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  dominant pile trying to get more fungi in a pile I would say don't use more than 70  
**[0:42:18-0:42:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  to 75% 75% yeah probably at the highest browns 25% greens and it's hard in the same sense  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:27):**  probably if you're trying to get more bacterial dominant compost I'm trying to think because  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:33):**  I'm never trying to do that so I don't really think about that I wouldn't go more than I  
**[0:42:39-0:42:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  mean yeah 50 50 even for a bacterial dominant compost or just yeah maybe maybe not as many  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:47):**  wood chips and just other types of brown sources that might be easier to break down than wood  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  chips so you might not get as much fungi going can you repeat that you cut out a second like  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:56):**  less mature carbon something like a corn stalk that's dry versus wood chips so I'm talking  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  to Troy Hinke of living roots compost tea.com. Troy one thing I think people could be saying  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:07):**  at this point in the episode is how do I know where I'm at are my soils bacterially dominated  
**[0:43:16-0:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:16):**  to the point where I need to come in and apply compost teas to up the fungal ratio I need  
**[0:43:24-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:24):**  to apply fungal dominated compost to up the compost ratio if you're just applying and  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  you're growing you might be getting good results but how do you know if you could be getting  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  better results if you change that ratio a lot of I think what you do around soil and  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:42):**  applying teas is correcting soil issues but let's go to somebody who doesn't have poor  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:48):**  soil they have pretty good soil how do they know if it couldn't be better they're just  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:54):**  not doing the right thing to make it better. Well observe nature what plants are coming  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  up you know are you having pioneer weeds or are you having tall grasses and brambles start  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  to come up you know what is nature showing you and again I'll refer to my succession  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:14):**  thing if you look at what plants are coming up you're going to get a general idea of probably  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  where your soils are at in the bacterial to fungal ratio but I also need to point out  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:27):**  again that it's not all about just bacteria and fungi bacteria and fungi are going to  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  break those materials down and hold that minerals and nutrients in their body but if they're  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  just in the soil holding those nutrients and minerals in their bodies you're not getting  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  that nutrient cycling going so the plants not being able to absorb anything if the bacteria  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  and fungi are still just present it's also a matter of having protozoa nematodes present  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:56):**  that are going to eat those and poop them out and give you those nutrients so in that  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  sense it really kind of does take a microscope to know that you've got the predators present.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:09):**  I mean if you've got healthy plants that aren't susceptible to diseases and pests then you  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:17):**  know most likely you're doing really good. You think the presence of pioneer weeds is  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:22):**  a reliable enough indicator to give a good indication of soil conditions like I hear

**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  it and says that is more myth than truth.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:41):**  From the soils that I've looked at that are weedy it's absolutely true that there's not  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:47):**  really any fungi and there's really not a lot going on at all in those soils and as  
**[0:45:54-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  a matter of fact it because of compaction if you you might have some weedy areas that  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  actually if you get down to it and it you know those pioneer weeds might not have that  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:05):**  deep of roots so they're kind of just tapping into the top few inches there but you might  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  have a compaction layer that's one foot deep, two foot deep, three feet deep that the roots

**[0:46:26-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  is possible that you've got an anaerobic dead zone where you know if you've got a compaction

**[0:49:20-0:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:20):**  there and bust it up can you apply a liquid soil drench in the form of a tea that can

**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  off with putting a seed in a hard clay soil you need to kind of break it up some and and

**[0:51:40-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:40):**  out of that same depth otherwise if you're well you can also use cover crops to help  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  feed the soil and help create structure like you're talking about with the daikon radish

**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:14):**  couple inches of compost that had been sitting there for a year and a half maybe and i went  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  over there and stuck my finger in and my finger could go down like up to here you know like  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  a good four inches so the biology like i said you're inoculating the biology onto the soil  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:30):**  and what happens is it slowly works its way down through the layers of soil i mean it's  
**[0:52:35-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  pretty slow it's not going to happen you know overnight or in one month it's going to be  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  several months but it slowly works its way down creating structure creating structure  
**[0:52:43-0:52:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:43):**  deeper and deeper into the soil and with that with the microbial breakdown in the soil you're  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:51):**  attracting more worms who are also then going to be coming into there creating soil structure  
**[0:52:56-0:53:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:56):**  breaking things up kind of working the soil for you so like it in that sense i had left  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:05):**  a pile of leaves a pile of straw and something else in a place in my yard with the intention

**[0:53:16-0:53:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  there for maybe six or nine months and then i took all that material and moved it somewhere  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:20):**  else to make a compost pile but everywhere underneath there because of it was kind of  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:26):**  like a mulch layer or whatever and there were microorganisms there worms had come up and  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:30):**  made already made the top like two inches of that into nice pliable soil just through  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:38):**  the action of worms and and obviously microorganisms too so yeah if you're not tilling and just  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  applying compost it's going to be a pretty slow process if you're wanting to get good  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  soil i would recommend if you're having you know if you have a really hard clay soil both  
**[0:53:58-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  clay soils and so sand soil that are heavy in sand need organic matter in there to help  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:06):**  create more structure so putting compost down is helping to get good biology and helping

**[0:54:14-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:14):**  more structure and worms to build more structure so yeah tilling and then adding compost on  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  top of that and and even putting down a compost tea to really get good biology going and then  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  so that's getting life back into the soil and then we need to keep life going in the  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  soil by always having plants in the soil to feed the soil so that's the importance of  
**[0:54:38-0:54:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  cover crops and companion crops so you know while in the off season you've got a cover

**[0:57:06-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  the structure of your soil to where you don't need to do any other additional methods so  
**[0:57:11-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  like Gabe Brown is a great one a great one to listen to on any podcast I would like to  
**[0:57:19-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  correct one thing that you said is that you've mentioned that you know to try to get the  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  biology going or no till we're trying to mimic a forest system which we're not necessarily  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  trying to mimic only a forest system it depends on the biology so you know if we look back  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  in history the Great Plains were covered in grasses they had a good amount of fungi in

**[0:58:10-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:10):**  land in a in an hour's rain event he his soil could hold a half an inch of rain in an hour  
**[0:58:21-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  and through his using good biology and cover crops he said that he can now absorb 29 inches  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  of rain in an hour and that's all about soil structure you know his soil is just like a  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:33):**  sponge now so then it's holding the water holding the air for future use and there's  
**[0:58:40-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:40):**  a I mean there's so many benefits to that you think of how much topsoil is lost in the  
**[0:58:47-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  in the Midwest or all over the United States right now into waterways and chemicals going  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  into those waterways if we were able to to hold all those especially with the heavy rain  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:58):**  events that we're getting due to whatever you want to climate change whatever you want  
**[0:59:03-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:03):**  to call it you know we're it's obvious we're getting crazy weather events with extreme  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  rains and things like that and if we were to work with nature like you know Gabe Brown  
**[0:59:15-0:59:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  has he's able to he's able to tackle this and and take that on and and not and not have  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  any detrimental effects yeah I mean the grasslands I think are a great example because there  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  you aren't really getting any tillage other than prairie dogs and maybe things like that  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:32):**  your company living roots compost tea you deal on the compost tea side of things to  
**[0:59:37-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  start kind of big picture here why is compost application not enough why should somebody  
**[0:59:44-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  think about adding tea to the mix in addition to applying straight compost there's advantages  
**[0:59:54-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  of compost tea I mean it's really all a matter of your needs when it comes down to your farm  
**[1:00:03-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  so what if you have compost like I said most people are applying 10 tons per acre you know  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  think of how much compost is that that's going to need and and that's all about inoculating  
**[1:00:15-1:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  the soil with good biology through that compost you can take a very small amount of compost  
**[1:00:22-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:22):**  you know like say for an acre I've used probably you know 15 to 20 cups of compost cups you  
**[1:00:32-1:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  know small very small amount of compost brewing a compost tea by adding microbial foods and  
**[1:00:39-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:39):**  the idea is to you know add aeration agitate it and get the populations get to a peak population  
**[1:00:45-1:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  where you've got a lot of bacteria you've got a good protozoa going and then you're  
**[1:00:49-1:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:49):**  not using that as inoculate onto the plants and soil so you've got the advantage of being  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:56):**  able to provide a foliar application but you're also able to use a lot less material and time  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:03):**  to get to inoculate soils and plants with good biology so like I said you know you're  
**[1:01:08-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:08):**  using far less compost and if you think about the equipment that you would need to haul  
**[1:01:15-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  out that much compost you know 10 plus tons onto a piece of land compared to taking a  
**[1:01:22-1:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  four-wheeler or any other type of backpack sprayer or on a large scale attractor it's  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:27):**  going to take a lot less time and energy to apply compost tea and use that as an inoculant  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  than to get compost down but again as I said you know it depends on your application and  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  what your need is because a lot of people are are their soil is needing that organic  
**[1:01:43-1:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:43):**  matter so it would be good to get a compost down I mean there's a number of things I could  
**[1:01:50-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:50):**  talk about with compost tea and you know you could take compost tea and use it as an inoculate  
**[1:01:58-1:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  on bad compost like what if you've got compost that you don't think is that great it's not  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:02):**  breaking down very fast spray it with some compost tea get that many more microorganisms  
**[1:02:06-1:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:06):**  going on there and help your compost break down faster well what about this let's say  
**[1:02:16-1:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:16):**  someone has a farm they've applied compost over the years so their organic matter is  
**[1:02:20-1:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:20):**  up at eight nine percent organic matter is not a problem they're in a no-till type system  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:26):**  they're leaving a lot of roots in the soil so organic matter let's say a lot of that's  
**[1:02:30-1:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:30):**  being replaced by roots if we ignore for right now the exporting of minerals from the soil  
**[1:02:40-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:40):**  so if we if we harvest lettuce and sell it off property we've mined some minerals from  
**[1:02:45-1:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  the soil and we've exported them if we throw that out right now that's not a consideration  
**[1:02:51-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:51):**  could we survive by just applying compost tea not compost so we're we're in inoculating  
**[1:03:02-1:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  that soil and adding more bacteria and fungi and organisms to the soil from tea a liquid  
**[1:03:09-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:09):**  versus a solid compost and just get off the compost train for good  
**[1:03:18-1:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:18):**  yeah you could I this is still questionable to me and I would say that I'd have to disagree  
**[1:03:27-1:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  disagree with Elaine's statement Elaine's always made the statement that all soils have  
**[1:03:35-1:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:35):**  enough nutrients and minerals to feed a plant and it's a matter of getting biology going  
**[1:03:39-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:39):**  in those soils to to access those minerals and nutrients and I can't say I fully agree  
**[1:03:51-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  I do believe and I'm not an expert on remineralization but I do believe that it's also more effective  
**[1:03:59-1:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  to have to incorporate remineralization or like in my compost teas I use I like to add  
**[1:04:06-1:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:06):**  as a my and I don't use a ton I could probably even put a little bit more into my compost  
**[1:04:11-1:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:11):**  teas but I'm trying to get you know those micronutrients and minerals going along in  
**[1:04:19-1:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:19):**  with the good biology and the nutrients from that biology to put back on the soil so yes  
**[1:04:26-1:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:26):**  I believe it I believe at a point you're going to need more than just compost tea maybe at  
**[1:04:35-1:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:35):**  that point it's focusing on that higher grade compost so it's less of a volume thing and  
**[1:04:40-1:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:40):**  more of a quality thing yeah right correct compost tea I see there's there's really two  
**[1:04:50-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  categories out there there's compost teas for the soil and there's compost teas as foliar  
**[1:04:57-1:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  feeds our foliar protectants amendments however you want to actually call that what are the  
**[1:05:05-1:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:05):**  differences between the two when you say go to brew them biologically speaking or is there  
**[1:05:11-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:11):**  a difference would you use the same tea on the leaves that you put on the soil  
**[1:05:21-1:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  I don't know about other people's experience with having two different types of teas for  
**[1:05:25-1:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:25):**  foliar versus soil application I don't I don't necessarily go by that but I will say this  
**[1:05:33-1:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:33):**  can get very confusing so compost tea to get very specific is where you put compost in  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:40):**  a mesh bag put it in water you're agitating that water for a certain amount of time through  
**[1:05:45-1:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:45):**  our adding air to that water and adding microbial foods and the importance of compost tea is  
**[1:05:51-1:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:51):**  the addition of foods for microbes so you're feeding microbes getting them to reproduce  
**[1:05:56-1:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:56):**  so just say I mean it's far greater than this but say you start out with a hundred microorganisms  
**[1:06:02-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:02):**  you're feeding them and trying to get them to reproduce to a hundred thousand microorganisms  
**[1:06:07-1:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  through that reproduction the bacteria and fungi create glues which helps those microorganisms  
**[1:06:14-1:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:14):**  to be stickier so when you're providing a foliar application it's much more likely that  
**[1:06:22-1:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:22):**  the microorganisms are going to stick on the surface of whatever you're spraying it's great  
**[1:06:30-1:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:30):**  to put that onto soil but you don't necessarily need that on soil so you could use just an  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:35):**  extract on soil an extract is different from tea in that you're putting compost in a mesh  
**[1:06:43-1:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  bag you're putting it in water and you possibly are aerating it but you're not putting any  
**[1:06:49-1:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:49):**  microbial foods in there so you're extracting those what I said was a hundred microorganisms  
**[1:06:54-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:54):**  just say a hundred microorganisms the point is to extract those hundred microorganisms  
**[1:06:58-1:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:58):**  in the into the water but then you're not getting them to reproduce so you're not getting  
**[1:07:03-1:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:03):**  those glues from reproduction and you can put that on at the land if anybody's just  
**[1:07:10-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:10):**  a quick kind of how-to like if anybody was interested in doing that you know you could  
**[1:07:15-1:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  kind of increase your population by putting compost in a bag extracting it dumping out  
**[1:07:21-1:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:21):**  that compost now you've got a hundred microorganisms refill your bag with compost do the same thing  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:28):**  so now you should have you know 200 micro 200 microorganisms you can increase the population  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  that way without you know adding foods but at a certain point you're getting so much  
**[1:07:37-1:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:37):**  sediment in there you can't like keep doing that because you're going to clog up your

**[1:09:42-1:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  normally do 20 gallons per acre but still like if you think about that little amount  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:46):**  on a whole acre it's very hard to get that little amount on a whole acre so you need

**[1:10:06-1:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:06):**  I may have used the wrong word yeah it takes 50 gallons to cover that amount of land you

**[1:10:15-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:15):**  of water 20 gallons of tea equals 50 gallons and then you'll spray that out so in that  
**[1:10:19-1:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  water what I'm getting at is that I will add foods to my water so that it provides more  
**[1:10:26-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:26):**  food for the microorganisms that I'm adding in with the tea to help even feed it more

**[1:10:42-1:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  comes in. As humans I think we have a hard time believing things that we can't see at  
**[1:10:52-1:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:52):**  least immediately because we've been just sold a bunch of snake oil like you mentioned  
**[1:10:58-1:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:58):**  in the past and in everything and I look at something like tea and the question I always  
**[1:11:06-1:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:06):**  see people ask and I often ask this of myself when I've made them is how do I know that  
**[1:11:13-1:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:13):**  it's actually working or doing something positive and by doing something positive I mean am  
**[1:11:22-1:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:22):**  I going from a 1 to a 1.5 or am I going from a 1 to a 100 for me to go to a 1 to 1.5 that's  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  great but is it worth the time maybe maybe not and this isn't just the compost you think  
**[1:11:38-1:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:38):**  it could be any of these minerals that they sell in all these catalogs they get this marketing  
**[1:11:45-1:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:45):**  spin on that that promises so many good things but for the end user at home what can somebody  
**[1:11:53-1:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:53):**  look for if they're doing trials with compost tea on their farm in their garden and say  
**[1:11:58-1:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:58):**  okay what change should they realistically expect to see with their eyes?  
**[1:12:06-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:06):**  With everything with this it all depends I mean depending on your soil depending on the  
**[1:12:12-1:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  quality of compost depending on the quality of compost tea depending on your plant you  
**[1:12:18-1:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  know you maybe you only go to a 1.5 or maybe you go to 100 it there's so many conditions  
**[1:12:25-1:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:25):**  and variables that that are dependent on that you know like what if you have a great what  
**[1:12:29-1:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:29):**  if you apply a great compost tea but then like you had some crazy I can't even think  
**[1:12:35-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  of a weather event that might come in but like something weird that affected that biology  
**[1:12:39-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:39):**  and then kind of negated it. My experience and what I've heard from other people is that  
**[1:12:50-1:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  normally their first application of compost tea they will notice possibly a drastic difference  
**[1:12:57-1:13:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:57):**  or at least some things that they can some slight variations that they can notice but  
**[1:13:06-1:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:06):**  then upon further applications of teas there won't be as like drastic of a difference because  
**[1:13:12-1:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:12):**  it is usually because that biology hasn't been present and then the plant gets the biology  
**[1:13:16-1:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:16):**  and it's like whoa party time you know like I finally get what I need but then it's kind  
**[1:13:21-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:21):**  of comfortable and it's got and it's got that it may need some extra but it's not going

**[1:13:58-1:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  that she was getting enough to convince me that I was like I want to do this I believe

**[1:14:07-1:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:07):**  when I went to Rodale. It was like this perfect time where this guy had just happened to donate  
**[1:14:12-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  a compost tea brewers there because Elaine had just started there and I was there and

**[1:16:36-1:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:36):**  what you just said is true that it's all about the microbial interaction yes there are nutrients  
**[1:16:41-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:41):**  in there but it's not the nutrients it's the microbial action that is giving them the advantage  
**[1:16:47-1:16:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  or there that's what they're gaining from yes so for somebody at home who wants to start  
**[1:16:54-1:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:54):**  what's a basic recipe for compost to I have a bucket I have water I have a bubbler I have  
**[1:17:03-1:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:03):**  some good quality compost do I need anything else so in any presentation not the cheapest  
**[1:17:13-1:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:13):**  way you can make compost tea you can get a bucket for free even by going to the bakery  
**[1:17:18-1:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  section at a grocery store and get a three to five gallon bucket you go to a paint store  
**[1:17:22-1:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:22):**  you get a two to three dollar paint strainer bag that's a five gallon bag it has an elastic  
**[1:17:27-1:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:27):**  top it fits perfectly on a bucket it's extremely it's like made for brewing the most you're  
**[1:17:32-1:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:32):**  gonna spend is on like a 20 to 40 dollar aquarium pump that's gonna pump air into there and  
**[1:17:39-1:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:39):**  then compost so with my my quality of compost I use three to five cups per five gallon brew  
**[1:17:47-1:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:47):**  I normally more on the three cup side it you really don't need much and then you know you  
**[1:17:53-1:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:53):**  could do just an extract and get results from that not add any foods but if you want to  
**[1:17:57-1:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:57):**  add foods so there's bacterial foods and there's fungal foods the really the only bacterial  
**[1:18:04-1:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:04):**  food that I recommend or that Elaine talks about is unsulfured blackstrap molasses which  
**[1:18:10-1:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:10):**  is something that you can get at the grocery store  
**[1:18:17-1:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17):**  then fungal foods there are different things the main ones that I like to use are humic  
**[1:18:23-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:23):**  acid fish hydrolysate and then I like to either use feather meal or kelp meal or soluble kelp  
**[1:18:33-1:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  and in a five gallon brew I'll use a tablespoon of humic acid possibly two but I don't go  
**[1:18:42-1:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:42):**  more than that and a tablespoon of fish hydrolysate and a tablespoon of kelp so like I'm not doing  
**[1:18:51-1:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:51):**  more than three tablespoons all together in the whole thing for five gallons you really  
**[1:18:55-1:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:55):**  it just really needs to keep it minimal because you're working with microorganisms that are  
**[1:19:00-1:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:00):**  tiny you know like they don't need a ton of food most people think that more is better  
**[1:19:04-1:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:04):**  but not in this case so minimal foods so yeah a tablespoon humic acid tablespoon fish hydrolysate  
**[1:19:11-1:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:11):**  tablespoon kelp or feather meal and then if I were to use a bacterial food the unsulfured  
**[1:19:22-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:22):**  blackstrap molasses I would only put like half to one teaspoon in a five gallon bucket  
**[1:19:29-1:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  and normally you've got enough the fish hydrolysate is going to also be food for bacteria and  
**[1:19:34-1:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:34):**  we've normally got enough bacteria going in our compost that we don't really need to get  
**[1:19:39-1:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:39):**  that going that much more because we're trying to get other microorganisms going more and  
**[1:19:44-1:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:44):**  then I've got a table that's a rule of thumb that I put together on brew time so brew time  
**[1:19:52-1:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:52):**  for a compost tea really is dependent on the ambient temperature outside which has an effect  
**[1:20:01-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:01):**  on the oxygen in the air as well so in the springtime in March and April when I've got  
**[1:20:06-1:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  cooler temps and it's getting down to 35 45 at night but then in the daytime it's getting  
**[1:20:16-1:20:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:16):**  up to 65 70 degrees I'm brewing for two and a half to three days to get to peak population  
**[1:20:25-1:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:25):**  in the summertime it's a lot hotter the microorganisms are more active anyway it will take you know  
**[1:20:33-1:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:33):**  in the middle of the summer I don't normally brew in the middle of summer but in the beginning  
**[1:20:38-1:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:38):**  of summer say it's only going to take you know if it's 75 at night 95 during the day  
**[1:20:45-1:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:45):**  it's going to take only you know like 24 hours to brew and because of that you're what I  
**[1:20:51-1:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:51):**  said you're trying to get to a peak population so the peak the population microorganisms are  
**[1:20:55-1:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:55):**  growing growing growing you hit a peak population and then all of a sudden they've run out of  
**[1:20:59-1:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:59):**  food and they've used up all the air even if you may have been oxygenating it and you  
**[1:21:03-1:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:03):**  quickly go anaerobic and so it's a matter of hitting that peak population and the problem  
**[1:21:09-1:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:09):**  that many people have is that they're brewing for too long and you're getting those anaerobic  
**[1:21:12-1:21:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:12):**  microorganisms going if you ever need to air air on the side of brewing for too short so  
**[1:21:21-1:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:21):**  if you think it's too hot out brew for just a few hours like I said that guy in Pennsylvania  
**[1:21:26-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:26):**  we weren't even using foods Franklin where we're using extract so we weren't increasing  
**[1:21:30-1:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  the populations and he and that was five gallons per acre and he was getting results so if  
**[1:21:35-1:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:35):**  you need to air air on the side of of being not brewing long enough or what you think  
**[1:21:40-1:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:40):**  would be long enough is there a visual cue for brewing too long there's not a lot of  
**[1:21:50-1:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:50):**  people a lot of people think it's great to like see foam in compost tea like foam really  
**[1:21:56-1:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:56):**  doesn't have anything to do necessarily with microorganisms yes they do create a little  
**[1:22:00-1:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:00):**  bit of foam through their reproduction but not the kind of things that I see people on  
**[1:22:04-1:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:04):**  YouTube videos talking about it's normally because you've got a thick substance like  
**[1:22:08-1:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:08):**  fish hydrolysate that's getting air pumped up through it so like just when you're a little  
**[1:22:11-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:11):**  kid and blowing on milk blowing in your glass of milk and creating bubbles it's kind of  
**[1:22:15-1:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  that same thing I the only thing that the only cue that I have noticed is once you start  
**[1:22:25-1:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:25):**  to get this the only way I can describe it as a wet straw smell so it's kind of a kind  
**[1:22:32-1:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:32):**  of a gross smell if you've smelled straw that sat around wet if you once you start to hit  
**[1:22:38-1:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:38):**  that I would say you're either at PQ population or you need to use it then if there are there  
**[1:22:48-1:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:48):**  are cues that that it's gone bad if you smell anything bad so same thing with a compost  
**[1:22:54-1:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:54):**  pile your our noses are meant to detect bad things and we can rely on our own devices  
**[1:23:02-1:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:02):**  so if you smell something that is very off-putting to you it's going to be off-putting the microorganisms  
**[1:23:11-1:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:11):**  especially because they're a lot more sensitive than we are so in a compost tea if you smell  
**[1:23:17-1:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:17):**  like a manure smell it's definitely gone anaerobic and you probably don't want to use it another  
**[1:23:23-1:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:23):**  thing I do need to mention is that compost tea is made with compost if you put soil and  
**[1:23:30-1:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:30):**  peat because people get this idea oh I need a fungal dominant brew so they'll take what  
**[1:23:35-1:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:35):**  they know is fungal dominant soil and put it in your brew and I can't say I haven't  
**[1:23:39-1:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:39):**  done that yes I have but you're taking the chance that there might be a pest or disease  
**[1:23:43-1:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:43):**  in that soil that hasn't gone through the composting process using pathogens into your  
**[1:23:52-1:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:52):**  brew so in that same sense I believe it was Penn State that did I think it was in the  
**[1:23:57-1:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:57):**  90s it was either in the 90s or early 2000s and that did compost tea experiments and research  
**[1:24:03-1:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:03):**  but they were using manure manure is not compost manure is manure so they were making manure  
**[1:24:07-1:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:07):**  tea and breeding E. coli and stuff like that so these people who are introducing bat guanos

**[1:24:17-1:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:17):**  necessarily a strictly compost tea compost tea is using compost and I apologize but I  
**[1:24:24-1:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24):**  meant to touch on this briefly way back in the conversation but you had mentioned cold  
**[1:24:28-1:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:28):**  composting I just want to mention this real quick the reason that we want to get up to  
**[1:24:31-1:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:31):**  temperature on a compost pile and go through what are called PFRPs practices practices  
**[1:24:36-1:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:36):**  that reduce pathogens is because those hot temperatures kill pathogens and weed seeds  
**[1:24:43-1:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:43):**  and so that's the benefit of having a hot composting process is because we're hopefully  
**[1:24:47-1:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:47):**  killing all the pathogens and weed seeds that are in that in that same sense with the smell  
**[1:24:52-1:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:52):**  if you've got a compost pile that you smell ammonia you're losing your nitrogen in the

**[1:25:02-1:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:02):**  you smell you're losing so much of that nitrogen as a gas form of ammonia and so the nitrogen  
**[1:25:09-1:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:09):**  that you should be keeping in your product is getting lost in a gaseous form as well  
**[1:25:14-1:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:14):**  as that compost is going anaerobic or if you get like a sulfur smell that's also gonna

**[1:25:26-1:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:26):**  in a gaseous form so anytime you smell something bad you're not only losing nutrients your

**[1:38:26-1:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:26):**  a lot of my thought would be around applying it to the soil where it sounds like a lot  
**[1:38:31-1:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:31):**  of what you're applying to is direct to foliage is that like if you had to recommend one way  
**[1:38:38-1:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:38):**  to use it is it on the foliage versus the soil I would say the most important thing  
**[1:38:45-1:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:45):**  is the soil so when I'm going out I didn't clarify that when I'm going out spraying what  
**[1:38:50-1:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:50):**  I normally do is if this the plant that I'm applying it to I'll hit the foliar foliage  
**[1:38:55-1:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:55):**  up here and then I'll zoom in and soak that root zone and so I'm getting a foiler spray  
**[1:39:02-1:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:02):**  and a soil soak in the root zone of the plant but the most important thing as I am trying  
**[1:39:09-1:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:09):**  to point out is the matter of getting that biology into the soil so that the soil can  
**[1:39:15-1:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:15):**  feed the plant and inoculating the soil.

**[1:39:24-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:24):**  teas is in the tea brewing process you've created this perfect environment for these  
**[1:39:32-1:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:32):**  microorganisms to survive.  
**[1:39:34-1:39:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:34):**  You're giving them tons of oxygen, tons of food, you're starting them out really vigorous  
**[1:39:39-1:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:39):**  and healthy, they're going nuts.  
**[1:39:42-1:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:42):**  Now you're relocating them to the soil which may be non-optimum conditions.  
**[1:39:51-1:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:51):**  Are they actually surviving in the soil or are you seeing like a rapid decline in population  
**[1:39:59-1:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:59):**  because soil conditions aren't potentially near where brew conditions were so it might  
**[1:40:06-1:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:06):**  not be as effective as thought?

**[1:42:49-1:42:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:49):**  of is fish emulsion or fish hydrolysate.  
**[1:42:53-1:42:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:53):**  So people in organics are using that as a fertilizer for their plants.  
**[1:42:59-1:43:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:59):**  Well, what is that?  
**[1:43:00-1:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:00):**  It's a food for microorganisms, so what are they really feeding?  
**[1:43:03-1:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:03):**  They're feeding the microorganisms.  
**[1:43:04-1:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:04):**  Yeah, so if you've got good biology in the soil, I do think that there's a benefit to  
**[1:43:10-1:43:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:10):**  that.  
**[1:43:11-1:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:11):**  I can't say that I've ever done that just myself, but yeah, say you want to increase  
**[1:43:16-1:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:16):**  things in your compost pile, what if you just took some humic acid and fish hydrolysate  
**[1:43:21-1:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:21):**  and put it in a mix and sprayed that into your compost pile, you're giving all kinds  
**[1:43:25-1:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:25):**  of foods to those microorganisms to help feed them.  
**[1:43:28-1:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:28):**  Yeah, I totally believe that.  
**[1:43:31-1:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:31):**  Dan Kittredge, the Bio-Nutrient Food Association, I think he has a great example of this.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38):**  He talks about, you know, like on cloudy days, if you've got multiple cloudy days in a row  
**[1:43:44-1:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:44):**  where you're not getting photosynthesis from the sun, you're not getting the root exudates

**[1:43:54-1:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:54):**  likes to use molasses mixed into water, diluted down into the water and sprayed out to his  
**[1:44:00-1:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:00):**  plants as a food, a sugar and food source for those microorganisms to keep them fed  
**[1:44:06-1:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:06):**  and keep them going in the soil for times like that.  
**[1:44:09-1:44:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:09):**  And I don't want to say that's true or that I know that that's true, but according to  
**[1:44:14-1:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:14):**  my research and my experience, that totally makes sense.  
**[1:44:17-1:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:17):**  All right, Troy, man, I really want to thank you for coming on today and sharing all this  
**[1:44:21-1:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:21):**  knowledge.  
**[1:44:22-1:44:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:22):**  I think a lot of people have a lot of information that they can go and work off of.  
**[1:44:27-1:44:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:27):**  A big takeaway for me is I want to go out and make some compost tea.  
**[1:44:30-1:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:30):**  I mean, I think, why not?  
**[1:44:31-1:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:31):**  And that would be my call out to people listening to this.  
**[1:44:34-1:44:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:34):**  Why not try it over the summer when things are growing?  
**[1:44:38-1:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:38):**  It's not going to take a lot of money and maybe, just maybe you'll get some great results.  
**[1:44:44-1:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:44):**  Any final thoughts you want people to take away when it comes to compost and compost  
**[1:44:47-1:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:47):**  tea?  
**[1:44:52-1:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:52):**  One thing I had failed to mention when we were kind of talking about the foliar spray  
**[1:44:56-1:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:56):**  is that according to Elaine's research and also my beliefs is that if you get the biology  
**[1:45:04-1:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:04):**  onto the foliar surfaces of a plant, you're providing a protective surface where you've  
**[1:45:08-1:45:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:08):**  got a wall of beneficial biology that's going to keep diseases and pests at bay.  
**[1:45:15-1:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:15):**  So like tomatoes get blight in the middle of the season.  
**[1:45:19-1:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:19):**  And so it's good to have a foliar application to help prevent this.  
**[1:45:24-1:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:24):**  Again, that goes back to having a healthy plant and healthy soil to not attract those  
**[1:45:29-1:45:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:29):**  pests in the beginning.  
**[1:45:30-1:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:30):**  But I just I did want to mention that because I hadn't mentioned that.  
**[1:45:35-1:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:35):**  And so like with application rates, people often ask about application rates, which we  
**[1:45:39-1:45:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:39):**  didn't get into.  
**[1:45:40-1:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:40):**  And I normally say at seed at first true leaf and then one and two months later or like  
**[1:45:46-1:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:46):**  with landscapes or lawns, I'll recommend three to four times per year.  
**[1:45:49-1:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:49):**  If you're doing gardening, I think it's good to get an application down once a month or  
**[1:45:53-1:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:53):**  depending on your plant, like say we've got roses or tomatoes, which are very susceptible  
**[1:45:57-1:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:57):**  in summer months to fungal issues.  
**[1:46:00-1:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:00):**  So then you'd be wanting to get out there once a week or once every other week to get  
**[1:46:03-1:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:03):**  a good coating of biology on those plants.  
**[1:46:06-1:46:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:06):**  So that's what makes a good, and I'm not saying that's a hundred percent.  
**[1:46:12-1:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:12):**  Just because you go out and spray doesn't mean you're not going to get diseases because  
**[1:46:15-1:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:15):**  there's always things that happen.  
**[1:46:18-1:46:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:18):**  But I had wanted to mention that because I had not gotten to mention that in our conversation.  
**[1:46:23-1:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:23):**  The seed thing is one really great thing to touch on, Click, here.  
**[1:46:26-1:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:26):**  I mean, I've heard people talk about inoculating seeds where you spray it, you then let the  
**[1:46:30-1:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:30):**  tea dry on the seed, the microbes go dormant.  
**[1:46:33-1:46:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:33):**  That way you can run it through a seed drill or a seeder.  
**[1:46:36-1:46:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:36):**  It gets into the soil when moisture hits it, that biology reactivates or you seed your  
**[1:46:41-1:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:41):**  plants into your cells that you're going to be transplanting from.  
**[1:46:44-1:46:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:44):**  And then you just spray that soil really quick.  
**[1:46:47-1:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:47):**  So the biology is there in the cell when you transplant the seed, the plant and the soil  
**[1:46:51-1:46:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:51):**  into this garden bed.  
**[1:46:54-1:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:54):**  Totally.  
**[1:46:55-1:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:55):**  Yeah.  
**[1:46:57-1:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:57):**  So again, relating this to humans or any other animal, when mammals come out of the vaginal  
**[1:47:03-1:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:03):**  canal, they're coated with tons of bacteria that are giving them this coating that's a  
**[1:47:09-1:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:09):**  good start to life, which is a really good start to life.  
**[1:47:12-1:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:12):**  And it's been shown that people who have C-sections, their kids need to be inoculated with this  
**[1:47:18-1:47:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:18):**  good biology from the vaginal canal.  
**[1:47:20-1:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:20):**  I'm sorry to get into this on a gardening podcast, but it's really good analogy.  
**[1:47:26-1:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:26):**  So with that in mind, we want to start the seeds off with good biology, coating them  
**[1:47:31-1:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:31):**  with soaking them in an extract to get that good biology on the surface or applying it  
**[1:47:36-1:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:36):**  as immediately as possible.  
**[1:47:38-1:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:38):**  I'll just mention real quick because a lot of people are into mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[1:47:43-1:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:43):**  And that's not one thing we didn't touch on, but saprophytic fungi is what you're going  
**[1:47:48-1:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:48):**  to find in compost.  
**[1:47:49-1:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:49):**  You might have mycorrhizal spores, but mycorrhizal spores need roots to germinate.  
**[1:47:53-1:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:53):**  So even if you have mycorrhizal spores in compost, it doesn't mean you have mycorrhizal  
**[1:47:58-1:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:58):**  fungi in compost.  
**[1:48:00-1:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:00):**  So you can purchase separate mycorrhizal spores to inoculate seeds.  
**[1:48:06-1:48:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:06):**  Or also, I'd wanted to mention that earlier is, I don't always, but it's always great  
**[1:48:11-1:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:11):**  to add a mycorrhizal spore powder, soluble powder into a compost tea mix.  
**[1:48:17-1:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:17):**  You can do that as well to get that into the roots, especially if you're doing root injections  
**[1:48:22-1:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:22):**  to get that into the soil and help to benefit plants that much more.  
**[1:48:26-1:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:26):**  So yeah, in that same, when we're talking about that, when you're doing your seeds,  
**[1:48:32-1:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:32):**  coat them with extract and add some mycorrhizal.  
**[1:48:34-1:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:34):**  If there are mycorrhizal, which 90 to 95% of plants have mycorrhizal associations, put  
**[1:48:39-1:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:39):**  some mycorrhizal powder in there because you're going to be using a lot less.  
**[1:48:44-1:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:44):**  It's all about money with most people.  
**[1:48:45-1:48:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:45):**  You're going to be using a lot less if you do it at a younger stage than if you're trying  
**[1:48:49-1:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-05-TroyHinke-CompostTea-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:49):**  to do it at a plant that's big, you're going to be using a lot less and you're going to

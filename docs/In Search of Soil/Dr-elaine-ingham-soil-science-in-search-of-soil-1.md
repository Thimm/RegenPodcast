### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:20):**  Today's episode of In Search of Soil takes us to the rhizosphere.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:25):**  The area of soil where plants and roots come together to interact.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:30):**  Where chemical processes and biological processes create magic to make plants grow.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:37):**  How much of what's actually happening there is magic and how much of it is reality?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:42):**  We hear a lot of great things when it comes to building soil and a lot of things that  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:47):**  might be more myth than truth.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:50):**  Like does crop rotation actually help?  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:53):**  Can you improve soil to make it good enough so weeds don't actually want to grow?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:59):**  Are these truths or are these myths?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:03):**  These are just some of the questions that we're taking on in this episode of In Search  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:07):**  of Soil with Dr. Elaine Ingham.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:10):**  First step is to make sure that we're growing bacteria in the soil.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:15):**  Dr. Elaine Ingham is a soil microbiologist and a soil pioneer.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:20):**  She's founder of SoilFoodWeb.com and she's someone who's dedicated a career to looking  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:27):**  at the soil microbial interactions and promoting them to the public at large.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:34):**  In this episode Dr. Elaine is going to take on some questions that may question your beliefs  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:40):**  about soil.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:43):**  Things like should you not rotate your crops?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:46):**  Is soil remineralization necessary?  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:49):**  And how important is it to balance out the amount of fungi with bacteria for the type  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:55):**  of crop that you want to grow?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:58):**  To answer these questions and many others let's jump into the conversation with Dr.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:03):**  Elaine Ingham.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:06):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:08):**  It's been a few years since we last chatted yet I've followed your work from afar.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:12):**  I've always admired it and one thing I've been thinking about lately is there anything  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:17):**  new that you've came across in the recent past that's really changed your view on soil  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:22):**  or just blown your mind?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:25):**  Recently we've been looking into the roles and functions of soil micro and macro arthropods  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:32):**  a little bit more deeply.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:34):**  We've always just had the attitude that micro arthropods, macro arthropods were predators  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:40):**  and that's really the only benefit they give to the soil food web.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:46):**  But that's not true.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:48):**  When we started delving a little bit deeper there are probably more like seven very important  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:55):**  functions that micro arthropods do.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:59):**  Just like you know people used to think that all nematodes were bad guys.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:03):**  They were all root feeders.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:06):**  If you saw a nematode it was like oh no go and get the toxic chemical because you've  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:11):**  got nematodes.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:12):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:14):**  But for fungi they have the same attitude.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:17):**  The only good fungus is a dead fungus and that's absolutely not true either.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:23):**  So as we have started looking deeper into the roles and functions of soil micro arthropods  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:30):**  they've got protective functions of the roots in the above ground part of the plant.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:36):**  They have their role in nutrient cycling where they are consuming the bacteria and or fungi  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:44):**  more likely the fungi and they're releasing nutrients in the form that the plant needs  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:51):**  to take up.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:53):**  They also have a role and a function in forming the aggregates within the soil those organo  
**[0:04:00-0:04:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:00):**  mineral coated or organic coated mineral particles that are slowly but surely chewing away on  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:11):**  the mineral particle and releasing nutrients.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:15):**  So micro arthropods we've only begun to stick them into all the different roles and functions  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:23):**  that they play in the soil.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:25):**  It's not just that they eat stuff there's all these other functions and so give us a  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:30):**  year or two to really work on that and we're going to be publishing a whole another chapter  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:37):**  in the story about the soil food web.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:40):**  For people who aren't familiar what are micro arthropods?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:44):**  So micro arthropods are things like springtails or bad mites some of the bad guys like the  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:52):**  red spider mites and you know so there's the good and there's the bad.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:57):**  How do you manage your agricultural ecosystems so you're selecting for the good guys that  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:04):**  will help plants grow versus the bad guys who are messages from mother nature saying  
**[0:05:10-0:05:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:10):**  to you bad human being you haven't been keeping your soil healthy these guys these bad guys  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:19):**  are messengers to say better pay attention because if you ignore mother nature what's  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:26):**  going to happen?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:27):**  She's just going to send a nastier pest a nastier disease-causing organism so and if  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:33):**  you don't pay attention to that she's going to send something even worse so you better  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:39):**  pay attention at the first message from mother nature this is what that means what is it  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:44):**  I'm doing wrong and what do I need to put back into my soil to reestablish that condition  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:50):**  of health.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:51):**  If you're missing some of those micro arthropods in your soil what's the cause of that?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:56):**  Is that due to some of the same reasons why you might feel heavy weed pressure in a soil  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:01):**  just a bacterial fungal imbalance or the right materials aren't present in the soil?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:07):**  Why are the micro arthropods missing?  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:09):**  Yep same reasons apply and you've got to now figure out which one so you've got that whole  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:16):**  failings of possible problems what does it mean and you've got to figure out what's gone  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:23):**  wrong because then you know what to fix so that's why sending a sample or learning to  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:30):**  do your own microscope work is so critical because we've got a tool that's going to immediately  
**[0:06:36-0:06:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:36):**  tell you what's wrong and that leads right to how do I fix this so now you've got to  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:45):**  find a compost or you've got to find a tea or an extract or something that will put those  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:52):**  organisms back into the soil so inoculation and then you want to promote the habitat that  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:59):**  allows them to be the winners and still be there over time so now we've got to look at  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:07):**  is your soil aerobic is water in filtering into that soil correctly where's that compaction  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:14):**  zone yep that's what we've got to do we've got to get rid of that or all the many different  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:20):**  things that could be wrong with that soil we want to figure out the cause of the problems  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:26):**  and that's you know the chemical world looks at symptoms and tries to kill the symptom  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:32):**  well that doesn't solve the problem at all we need to figure out what's the cause and  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:38):**  fix that problem if you think about the microscope I think it's an underutilized tool when it  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:44):**  comes to farming and gardening and really soil science for the amateur I think people  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:50):**  can get intimidated by it and I don't think they realize the value of it what are your  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:54):**  thoughts on that yeah well when when you figure that kids are who are in kindergarten or first  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:01):**  or second grade learn how to use a microscope within an hour or two time period and you  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:08):**  let them go and let them start looking at any any of the choices within the classroom  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:13):**  go outside grab a bit of soil grab sand whatever you want to look at take a look at it and  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:19):**  they can do a perfectly fine job it's you know we're human beings allow themselves to  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:25):**  be intimidated because I think that their training has always been don't touch that  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:31):**  microscope you could hurt it no you'd have to drop a microscope to hurt it so as long  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:37):**  as you're going through the steps and learning there shouldn't be any problem anyone should  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:43):**  be able to use the microscope please don't get intimidated by it come in and work with  
**[0:08:50-0:08:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:50):**  us we have people who will help you over their computers so you'll set up your microscope  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:58):**  you'll get the camera going on your microscope you hook your camera into your laptop screen  
**[0:09:04-0:09:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:04):**  and you share screen with the mentor and then they can tell you exactly what you're doing  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:13):**  no that's not the next step this is the next step and so just write it down you know here  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:19):**  step by step by step and if you ever have any trouble we'll come back and we'll repeat  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:24):**  this session until it becomes second nature yeah I would agree I mean sometimes we're  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:29):**  our own worst enemy and for people that have that intimidation or that fear you offer courses  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:34):**  on learning how to use the microscope when it comes to soil at soilfoodweb.com yes yeah  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:40):**  so we have we have the microscope course so that's the foundation class number four we  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:47):**  have the general overall theory of the soil food web approach so that's foundation class  
**[0:09:53-0:10:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:53):**  number one making compost foundation class number two making extracts and teas soil the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:02):**  foundation class number three and then we teach people to to start a lab of their own  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:10):**  where you advertise and you let your the local community know that you can take their soil  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:16):**  samples and you can tell them how to fix their problems so we're teaching people to run their  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:23):**  own laboratories we've got the consultant training program so you can become a consultant  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:29):**  and go out and help people fix their whole ecosystem based on all your years of looking  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:34):**  through the microscope at soil what are some of the most common issues you see when you  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:40):**  look at soil under the microscope what's missing what are the problems you begin to realize  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:47):**  that you're missing massive parts of that soil food web the only thing that most people  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:55):**  see when they look at soil is a boatload of bacteria and if that's all you've got in your  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:03):**  soil that's not soil that's dirt you're not going to grow plants without using toxic chemicals  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:12):**  well and then how much nutrient can that plant actually have in it if it's only getting an  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:18):**  excess of nitrogen and phosphorus and maybe if you're lucky calcium it's missing all the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:25):**  other nutrients so how can that be healthy for a human being so we've got to get this  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:29):**  whole nutrient cycling system back into the soil and that's what we mostly see is that  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:35):**  people are trying to grow plants in dirt not in soil so they can't possibly have healthy  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:43):**  plants for themselves or their animals to eat yeah i think all of us want healthy plants  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:48):**  not just because we only want healthy plants but because we want to be healthier as people  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:53):**  and i mean that's been emphasized here with the whole covid 19 pandemic when you think  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:58):**  about bacterial dominated soils in a production setting maybe that's a garden maybe that's  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:04):**  on a home set maybe that's on a farm what could people expect if they fixed that bacterial  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:10):**  imbalance and they shifted the soil to more of a fungal bacterial balance where it was  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:17):**  more even instead of fungal instead of being bacterially dominated my expectation would  
**[0:12:24-0:12:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:24):**  be that weeds would go away because as you get the fungi growing those fungi put out  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:33):**  the form of nitrogen for your crop plants not for the weeds so that would be my first  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:42):**  expectation is what you would notice first before anything else maybe secondly that all  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:48):**  of your seeds germinate more rapidly in a healthy environment and then those plants  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:55):**  are getting all the nutrition that they need in the proper balances because it's the plant  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:01):**  putting out the exudates telling the bacteria and fungi what to do and so the bacteria and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:07):**  fungi go do that because that they're being fed and they're bringing back to that plant  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:13):**  the nutrients that that plant requires so actually I missed a step the bacteria and  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:18):**  fungi have to be eaten by their predators and that's what releases the plants available  
**[0:13:24-0:13:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:24):**  nutrients because the predators have lower concentration of nutrients in their bodies  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:32):**  so they've got to exit the excess so mother nature very cleverly designed this system  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:38):**  to work this way and it works very well until you start killing stuff tillage is a huge  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:45):**  problem you till you are asking for weeds you are asking for a problem with fertility  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:53):**  your plants not going to have the nutrition because with tillage you sliced and diced  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:58):**  and crushed all the good guy fungi you wiped out your predators in the system so the good  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:05):**  guy nematodes are now gone and the root feeding nematodes are having a heyday out there it's  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:12):**  like all right all the competition disappeared look at this root chow chow chow and you start  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:20):**  having problems so yeah it's a the things we expect to see is a reduction in the weeds  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:28):**  we expect to see seeds germinating faster we see the plants themselves growing faster  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:35):**  having a more healthy color to them because they're getting that whole group of nutrients  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:41):**  that they require in order to be healthy they start flowering earlier they will set seed  
**[0:14:49-0:14:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:49):**  earlier and so that whole cycle goes faster your yields are typically higher it depends  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:59):**  on how good a job you've done matching what the requirements of the plant actually are  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:07):**  and how much yield increase that you'll get so people haven't done a real good job of  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:12):**  fixing the problem in the soil they haven't they don't have a microscope they're kind  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:17):**  of trying to determine whether their plants are happy or not by the way they look so they're  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:24):**  less likely to get all of the benefits up and going in that first growing season so  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:31):**  that they may not see a huge increase in yields if they would get that microscope and they'd  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:38):**  be able to monitor what's going on in their soil then they would be able to get those  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:46):**  responses of the organisms up to the levels that they require and much more likely therefore  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:53):**  to have better nutrition in the crop material in the food as well as higher yields in thinking  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:00):**  about this fungal bacterial balance in soils one of the things i always hear a lot of times  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:06):**  right here on youtube in the comments section is forests grow in fungally dominated soils  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:13):**  and herbaceous plants or grasslands grow in bacterially dominated soils i think that statement  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:20):**  is oversimplified and over generalized when you hear that statement what are your thoughts  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:26):**  on it and what does the science say about that statement when somebody says that kind  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:33):**  of sentence it is true but it's minimizing the balancing that has to go on if you're  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:41):**  growing weeds you know so if i can use my hands here if your weeds if your fungi are  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:47):**  down here at the you know almost nobody home and your bacteria are up here at oh my gosh  
**[0:16:53-0:17:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:53):**  you know 15 000 micrograms per gram of soil for the bacteria this is set to grow weeds  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:02):**  you've got to bring that bacterial population down by increasing the fungi these two guys  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:08):**  compete with each other the the normal community is going to the bacteria going to come down  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:14):**  as your fungi come up and so now you've got a situation where you might be growing brassica  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:21):**  coal and kale crops require that kind of balance of bacteria and fungi in the soil but if that's  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:27):**  not what you want to be growing you want to get that fungal to bacterial ratio closer  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:32):**  together now you're growing tomatoes potatoes you know all of the solanaceae that we like  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:40):**  so much as we want to grow highly productive grasses you want to get both the bacteria  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:45):**  and fungi at the same biomass within the soil the higher you can get that biomass and notice  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:53):**  my hands are now going up together if we can get that balance we'll get higher yields the  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:59):**  higher that fungal to bacterial ratio becomes so what's the maximum yield that we can get  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:08):**  in anybody's field well we haven't gotten to that point where we don't get higher yields  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:16):**  and higher yields and higher yields we we've got more research to do what is that highest  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:21):**  point there's got to be a limit but we haven't reached it yet so i can't tell you what that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:26):**  is but we can double and triple quadruple 10 times 50 times more yield if you can get  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:33):**  that biology going up higher and higher in your soil but what if you want to grow shrubs  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:39):**  you want to grow grapevines you want to grow blueberries well then your fungi have to keep  
**[0:18:45-0:18:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:45):**  going up because that's a condition that is going to grow much healthier blueberries blackberries  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:54):**  wine grapes whatever kinds of shrubs you you want to be growing if you want a deciduous  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:00):**  forest a healthy deciduous forest that fungal component has to keep going up notice that  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:06):**  the bacteria are not increasing but they're not decreasing either it's just that focal  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:12):**  component is going up so you got to have the bacteria in there and what people mostly don't  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:18):**  really actually hear is fungal dominated it's not like fungi are the only thing in that  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:26):**  soil there's just more fungi than there are bacteria so they got to listen really hard  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:31):**  when somebody says that sentence when if you want old growth cedar you want you know all  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:38):**  those beautiful trees down in california that are huge trunks you know all of those redwood  
**[0:19:46-0:19:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:46):**  trees and such that fungal biomass has to be even higher 75 percent of the volume or  
**[0:19:55-0:20:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:55):**  weight of a gram of soil should be fungal biomass in a healthy conifer forest certainly  
**[0:20:06-0:20:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:06):**  during that winter into the growing season you should see that huge amount of fungal  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:14):**  biomass in the soil well but now predators of the fungi are going to come along and start  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:18):**  eating those fungi releasing the nutrients that were being held that were prevented from  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:25):**  leaching out of that soil held in the fungal biomass the predators come along eat the fungi  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:34):**  now the trees are getting all the nutrition that they need but you might go out in the  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:40):**  middle of the summertime and see that you don't have 75 percent of a cup of soil being  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:48):**  fungal biomass but they'll regrow come the late fall when all of that litter material  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:56):**  falling to the surface of the soil is decomposed by the fungi the fungi start growing and completely  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:04):**  tie all that soil together so it doesn't leach it doesn't erode it doesn't wash down the  
**[0:21:10-0:21:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:10):**  hill it stays in place and so very necessary functions to maintain a healthy conifer forest  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:20):**  in thinking about that in a farming context are you trying to be closer to a one-to-one  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:26):**  fungal to bacterial ratio you want to pay attention to what the crop it is that you  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:32):**  want to grow what are the balances that it needs so where is your crop in the successional  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:38):**  system and then you want to mimic you want to get that food web going if i take it as  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:45):**  a given that those ratios can change given the time of year is it important to note when  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:51):**  you're taking that measurement and that reading because you're probably going to get a different  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:56):**  reading in summer versus winter and if you try and balance your soils off just one season  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:02):**  you might get yourself out of whack yep so in natural systems you you need to pay attention  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:10):**  to what time of year it is in agricultural systems we're disturbing those systems all  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:18):**  the time and it's almost like we're setting it back to ground zero not where we want to  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:25):**  be for a lot of our more higher level plants to be healthy and happy so we want to get  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:33):**  that fungal to bacterial biomass ratio at the proper level right from the beginning  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:39):**  right when that seeds put into the ground and starts to grow or when that a perennial  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:45):**  crop that you might have you know shrubs and bushes and things you want to recognize what  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:51):**  time of year it is and realize this is the time of year where we've got to have more  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:57):**  fungal biomass in their lower bacteria because we want to have beautiful big blueberries  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:04):**  that taste really sweet and actually have a blueberry flavor to them that's one thing  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:09):**  i always notice about the blueberries grown with good biology is they actually taste like  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:15):**  blueberries as opposed to something that's grown in chemical plants and it's just mush  
**[0:23:21-0:23:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:21):**  you're eating water yeah and it's like this is not tasty so getting the proper biology  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:30):**  really lends so much more flavor to anything that you want to grow if we think about that  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:36):**  fungal to bacterial ratio in the soil and how it relates to specific crops i see how  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:41):**  that information could be valuable do you have or do you know of a chart that's published  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:47):**  that has different crops with the different preferred ratios for those crops yeah so on  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:53):**  our website we have been adding that data and i think there's a table on the website  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:59):**  certainly if you take the foundation classes we go through that successional system over  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:05):**  and over and over again and anytime somebody who's taken the foundation courses there's  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:13):**  a information line that they can call into or they can email us that question so you  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:20):**  know if you've taken some of our courses you should be able to answer those questions yourself  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:26):**  but you know if it's like i never heard of elaine talking about you know these kinds  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:31):**  of beans what is that ratio of fungida bacteria that these beans require and so just send  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:37):**  us an email and we'll answer that for you if we think about a lot of agricultural soils  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:43):**  being out of balance on the bacterial side for crops like vegetables could we go the  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:48):**  other way and go out of balance on the fungal side when it comes to growing vegetables could  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:54):**  we create a too much fungus problem one popular method of gardening now is the wood chip or  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:00):**  back to eden gardening method a lot of people use it a lot of people say they get great  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:05):**  results and i think they look at their garden and they think it looks great it makes them  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:08):**  feel great the results are anecdotal they're not doing any sort of real analysis there  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:14):**  but by adding all these wood chips on top of the soil could you be creating a problem  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:19):**  by providing too much fungal food and thereby creating a soil that's out of balance towards  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:25):**  the fungal side of things yeah and you can do that because you know think about what  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:29):**  i was just talking about with the successional process if you want to grow bushes shrubs  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:36):**  you want to get that fungal that bacterial to fungal ratio like two times to five times  
**[0:25:41-0:25:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:41):**  more fungi than bacteria okay that means this is not really good for growing tomatoes don't  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:49):**  don't try to grow your tomatoes in this because they're they're going to be hurting for certain  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:54):**  kinds of nutrients you really want that um almost equal fungi to bacteria but slightly  
**[0:26:01-0:26:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:01):**  on the fungal side to grow tomatoes so if you're constantly putting um wood chips or  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:11):**  other fungal foods into that soil sooner or later you're going to go over the edge into  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:18):**  something where you've got too much fungi so you're not seen as good a grow they're  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:24):**  not your tomatoes aren't as happy your corn isn't as happy your barley your oats things  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:30):**  like that are the hay in your pasture are not doing so well that means you've gone too  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:37):**  far well you know what if it's the other way around you don't have enough yeah you got  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:42):**  to get it into the proper balance for the plant that you're trying to grow and so how  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:48):**  well let's stop putting the wood chips into your garden bed right because you've gone  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:54):**  over that edge or what if you realize this and it's like wow but i i really need to have  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:01):**  great tomatoes and i promised everybody the most delicious tomatoes they've ever had what  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:07):**  do you do to switch this around the simplest thing to do is to go get some blackstrap non-sulfured  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:16):**  molasses because that is bacteria food par excellence you want to get those bacteria  
**[0:27:24-0:27:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:24):**  revved up you get them going you just put a very small amount of molasses into the soil  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:32):**  and you'll see your bacteria starting to bounce up so if you were here you're going to be  
**[0:27:37-0:27:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:37):**  here pretty rapidly don't overdo it get too many bacteria and now you're growing weeds  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:46):**  so you've got to be careful as you're doing some of these things and that's where the  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:50):**  microscope becomes so easy to give you the answers that you need you take a sample of  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:58):**  that soil put it on the microscope and now you look at the balance of the bacterial and  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:03):**  the fungal biomass and you know that you should not be putting on any more molasses or you  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:10):**  haven't quite put enough next year don't put the wood chips in at the high concentrations  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:16):**  that you have been putting the wood chips in that totally makes a lot of sense and i  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:20):**  think it is a case of too much is not necessarily too much of a good thing it's maybe this is  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:27):**  a guy thing but it's like when you go to do laundry and you pour the laundry detergent  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:31):**  into the little cup and the lines right at the bottom and you kind of look at that and  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:36):**  say that's not enough and you just pour more in and suddenly you have a brady bunch overflowing  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:41):**  washing machine moment and it is important to limit what you're putting in but it's also  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:46):**  i'm realizing important to know what what you're putting into the soil what it's actually  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:52):**  doing when it gets to the soil and you can't see that with your eyes you can't look at  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:57):**  the soil and tell you look at the plants or maybe analyze the plants and have some idea  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:01):**  of what's going on in the soil but you can't see into the soil and i'm realizing the importance  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:07):**  of a microscope here and how that can actually help you see what's happening in the soil  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:12):**  so you can get some idea of what you're working with what you're starting with so you can  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:17):**  adjust from there and you're not just pouring stuff onto the soil or layering stuff onto  
**[0:29:22-0:29:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:22):**  the soil flying blind not really knowing if you're adding what you need or not yeah exactly  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:31):**  so it's a really useful tool to help you manage correctly and you know as the the saying is  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:38):**  goes you know if you can't measure you can't manage so where's your measurement tool it's  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:45):**  very simple to learn to use that microscope identify these organisms and know whether  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:51):**  you should be putting on more molasses or whether you should be putting on humic acid  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:56):**  and whether you're adding molasses or humic acid or even compost to the soil those are  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:00):**  ways that humans try to build soil we add stuff to the top or we pour stuff on or we  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:07):**  try and turn stuff into the soil but another way soil can be built is just by nature doing  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:13):**  it plants putting plants in the ground and letting plants help encourage microbial life  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:19):**  underneath the soil by getting that carbon pump going collecting the sun rays turning  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:24):**  it into sugar and then injecting that sugar into the soil to feed microbial life when  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:30):**  you think about plants building soil are there fungal favorite plants like i'm thinking cover  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:37):**  crops that you could plant that would encourage fungi to grow either while the crops are living  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:43):**  or that the fungi could feed off when the cover crops are terminated what are your thoughts  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:48):**  on that are there crops that are more fungal lee than bacterially favored yeah if if you  
**[0:30:54-0:31:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:54):**  want to use and see we always recommend cover plants that are perennial because they're  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:02):**  and you want the really short low growing ones they put their roots down deep into the  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:07):**  soil typically their perennial plants are going to get those down they're fairly they're  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:12):**  somewhat woody typically and so short low going things so they're not going to interfere  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:19):**  with whatever crop you're trying to grow but you don't have to mow these down you don't  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:25):**  have to crimp them you don't have to do anything year after year after year for the next two  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:30):**  thousand years we could have the same cover plants growing and never have to do anything  
**[0:31:37-0:31:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:37):**  to add more mulch or add more compost or all the other things that are so laborious when  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:46):**  we're trying to maintain a garden or an acre of your farm or something so that could be  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:51):**  so that's enough because they're gonna you know you harvest the above ground part of  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:56):**  your plants you let the residues fall to the surface of the soil and because these cover  
**[0:32:03-0:32:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:03):**  plants are maintaining that biology in the soil it doesn't matter that your crop above  
**[0:32:11-0:32:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:11):**  ground got all dried out you know really hot dry conditions which is what we want to you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:19):**  know before we harvest any seeds but if your soil surface dried and got all hardened out  
**[0:32:28-0:32:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:28):**  all of your biology has either gone down into the soil or a lot of that biology has died  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:36):**  which means now you're going to have to do something to bring back that biology that  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:41):**  shouldn't have died it should have been covered by something but the easy way to do it is  
**[0:32:47-0:32:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:47):**  to seed in that perennial crop once and then it's there forever and it's going to protect  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:54):**  your soil surface from drying out it's going to protect your soil surface from one of the  
**[0:32:59-0:33:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:59):**  most compacting factors ever invented which is rainfall falling from the sky and smacking  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:07):**  on your soil that's a compacting event oftentimes you will see the compaction layer forming  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:13):**  at the surface but if it's not forming here it's forming down here usually at about four  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:19):**  to six inches and there's a compaction layer in your soil that won't let your roots grow  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:25):**  down as deep into that soil as you want them to grow and then those cover plants will maintain  
**[0:33:32-0:33:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:32):**  the biology in your soil after you've harvested your crop plant so you're still making sure  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:41):**  you're keeping the balance where it needs to be for whatever plant you're trying to  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:46):**  grow make sure you're matching your cover plant to what you want to grow here it means  
**[0:33:53-0:34:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:53):**  that you don't rotate your crops you may rotate within the same successional stage but you  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:02):**  wouldn't want to grow brassicas here one year and then corn here the next year the brassica  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:08):**  wipe out all the mycorrhizal fungi that the corn has to have in order to be able to yield  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:15):**  well you put to all this mycorrhizal spores back into the soil to in order to grow your  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:21):**  crop is here and now the next year you put the brassica on there you are not going to  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:27):**  be growing brassica if you've got a massive amount of mycorrhizal colonization in that  
**[0:34:32-0:34:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:32):**  system so you stop rotating kind of mindlessly you rotate and you stay within the same successional  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:42):**  stages not mixing these things that need mostly bacteria versus things that need mostly fungi  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:50):**  and so the exudates coming out of the root system of that perennial plant maintain the  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:55):**  biology where you want it to be so you could keep growing corn in the same place year after  
**[0:35:01-0:35:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:01):**  year after year after year after year so um here we go with the organic regs organic says  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:12):**  the organic management system says you have to rotate crops because they have the mistaken  
**[0:35:18-0:35:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:18):**  understanding that if you plant the same plant for very long it's somehow going to remove  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:26):**  too much of one or two nutrients that's not how soil works you keep planting something  
**[0:35:33-0:35:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:33):**  in the same place you'll get some dominant organisms kind of taken over but if you have  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:42):**  the cover plant in there now you've got yep the main crop but why not make certain that  
**[0:35:48-0:35:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:48):**  you've got five or six different species of plants growing as that short low growing cover  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:57):**  plant or ground cover it's another term that people use for these kinds of plants and so  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:02):**  now you have a mix you're going to maintain all the different species of bacteria and  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:08):**  fungi and protozoa nematodes and micro arthropods and earthworms and everything else that should  
**[0:36:12-0:36:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:12):**  be in that soil so you don't lose diversity now people always say you're going to if you  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:20):**  plant the same thing in the same place year after year you're going to develop a massive  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:25):**  number of disease causing problems you're going to have pests like you wouldn't believe  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:30):**  they just get worse every year you can't mean keep growing the same thing in the same place  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:37):**  but you're preventing the diseases and the pest problems from developing by having this  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:42):**  diversity nutrient cycling is always going to go on your plants always going to have  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:47):**  all the nutrients that it needs every second of every day it will never be stressed and  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:54):**  the diseases and pests never come into that part of your garden so we've got to do a little  
**[0:37:00-0:37:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:00):**  bit of readjustment of people's thoughts about having to rotate plants if you maintain good  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:08):**  biology in your soil you don't ever have to rotate your plants keep growing the same thing  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:13):**  in the same place for as long as you want to the whole idea of not rotating crops and  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:18):**  growing the same crop year after year in the same location it's interesting and it parallels  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:24):**  i guess the natural analogy would be a grassland one that's not successional but one that lives  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:29):**  for thousands and thousands of years where you more or less have the same species of  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:33):**  grass growing in that same space and you're getting all that nutrient cycling through  
**[0:37:38-0:37:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:38):**  herbivores and fires and that type of thing that have a robust diverse microbial community  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:45):**  below ground that enable this huge grass biomass to grow above ground that's never really changing  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:51):**  there is no crop rotation in a grassland it's healthy and when it isn't the system fixes  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:57):**  itself so is that what we're mimicking here yep i like all the like the blueberry meadows  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:04):**  that people have and um here in oregon up in the mountains as far as we know and going  
**[0:38:11-0:38:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:11):**  back into indian lore this has been a blueberry patch for the last thousand years and yet  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:19):**  it's some of the best blueberries you'll ever taste in your whole life and they're not sick  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:24):**  they're not unhealthy they're not attracting disease how can that be what it means is our  
**[0:38:30-0:38:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:30):**  understanding of agriculture is flawed as human beings when we start paying attention  
**[0:38:37-0:38:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:37):**  to how nature manages things and we start changing our agriculture to work the way nature  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:45):**  works because nature has only been managing to do this process for the last three and  
**[0:38:52-0:39:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:52):**  a half to four billion years i think she's had a little bit of time to figure it all  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:00):**  out why do we human beings have to be so arrogant that we think we know better than nature so  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:07):**  pay attention to what nature does and probably the the most important tool that you need  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:14):**  is a microscope so you'll be able to see what nature is actually doing and then mimic her  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:21):**  thinking about this perennial ground cover in a vegetable type system what types of plants  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:27):**  come to mind i've thought a lot about this you need something low-lying you probably  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:31):**  want it to provide several functions maybe it fixes nitrogen or it's a pollinator or  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:37):**  something like that what are crops that you've heard of or that you can think of that come  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:42):**  to mind when you think about a perennial ground cover in a vegetable-based system um we have  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:50):**  a whole list of those different plants on the website just because i can't remember  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:54):**  them all um you know i go out in my backyard and i've got like 10 different kinds of cover  
**[0:40:00-0:40:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:00):**  plants for where i'm growing tomatoes and potatoes or um celery or lettuce um really  
**[0:40:08-0:40:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:08):**  good match for those kinds of plants if you really want to grow at um the brassica and  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:16):**  most a lot of people do brassica coal kale crops you want to be pushing actinobacteria  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:22):**  in that soil so in your compost you want to always develop that actinobacteria community  
**[0:40:28-0:40:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:28):**  that's what prevents the mycorrhizal fungi from attacking those root systems of the brassicas  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:35):**  so um if you want to have perennial understory plants you want to go towards the creeping  
**[0:40:42-0:40:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:42):**  thyme the um creeping lavender that's there's a whole slew of of short low growing things  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:51):**  that have very woody stems and that's usually a good giveaway so go to your seed catalogs  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:58):**  and start paying attention to how tall do these plants actually grow and dutch white  
**[0:41:03-0:41:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:03):**  clover works really great when we're dealing with the um tomatoes potatoes um celery those  
**[0:41:12-0:41:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:12):**  sorts of things um but the other clovers have driven me crazy um you know i bought the mini  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:21):**  clover that wasn't supposed to grow more than two inches well in my garden under my conditions  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:27):**  those clovers grow to a foot and a half right so if you've got a good healthy soil look  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:35):**  out for the claims about yes this is a mini clover it only grows this tall um we tried  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:41):**  micro clover we've tried all the different kinds of clovers they're fine under big tall  
**[0:41:48-0:41:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:48):**  trees and shrubs but you grow anything that's going to be shorter no it's not a good match  
**[0:41:56-0:42:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:56):**  i i remember where we grew um a row of beets and we had a clover as the understory plant  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:05):**  so we dug out a big space around each one of those beet plants that we put in so it  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:11):**  must have been you know eight inches across and we figured okay we've got the clover beet  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:17):**  back it shouldn't there should be no problem we'll be back on monday to see how things  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:23):**  are going so we left and we could see every single clover we got back on monday we couldn't  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:30):**  find the beets swallowed the be swallowed up just covered by a layer of clover and so  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:38):**  now you have to dig in there and try not to rip up the beets while you're trying to rip  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:43):**  out the clover and just not worth the time and effort uh that condra is another really  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:50):**  good one for most vegetable crops uh dichondra typically doesn't get much taller than a couple  
**[0:42:56-0:43:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:56):**  of inches and the root systems go nice and deep down into the soil um pretty aggressive  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:03):**  they don't usually allow anything to grow and take over them you know grasses are about  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:10):**  the only thing that yeah on occasion you're have to gonna kind of come in and want to  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:14):**  pull out a couple of the grass plants that are starting to grow real tall but otherwise  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:20):**  dichondra works really well so this is kind of headline material i think it's an eye catcher  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:26):**  it's click baity and it's a mind blower for some people but do you think that if you got  
**[0:43:33-0:43:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:33):**  your soil in balance microbially biologically that you could dramatically decrease weed  
**[0:43:41-0:43:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:41):**  pressure and potentially never or rarely see weeds in that soil again unless the soil was  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:50):**  damaged it would be a very rare thing and then those weeds would be the things that  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:56):**  would be sick and unhappy and unhealthy and they often won't flower they often aren't  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:03):**  going to go through a reproductive stage if you do see them reproducing it's certainly  
**[0:44:08-0:44:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:08):**  easy enough to pull off the flowers um so on rare occasions we'll we'll find there was  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:16):**  a bear patch or something a mouse came in and had to dig up something it buried something  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:22):**  a squirrel came and buried an acorn or oh okay so we get the occasional weeds but it's  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:29):**  certainly not like something that you're going to have to come in and deal with or walk down  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:34):**  the road with your weed eater and just cut off the tops of the weeds that are growing  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:39):**  above your cover crop i love the idea of the perennial ground cover and if you had to choose  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:45):**  between keeping a perennial ground cover in place and adding compost to supplement the  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:51):**  soil from the top which one would you choose obviously the perennial ground cover has some  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:58):**  advantages like it's less work you plant it once and it keeps working forever underneath  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:03):**  the ground but there's also some types of plants and commercial crops that a perennial  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:09):**  ground cover would be cumbersome with so could you mimic the perennial ground cover with  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:16):**  something like compost teas if you couldn't have a perennial ground cover at the same  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:22):**  time as a cash crop just given how these crops grow yeah and it's got to be a decision on  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:30):**  the part of the person who owns the garden who owns that soil that land which one do  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:35):**  you feel more comfortable doing and i of course being a lazy gardener i want to do as little  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:43):**  work as possible i'd much rather go swimming for the whole entire summer than be you know  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:48):**  pulling weeds out so i'm always going to pick the permanent cover so that there's not a  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:55):**  lot of work there for me to do but if that's not somebody's choice that you know they oh  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:00):**  it's too difficult trying to figure out all the combinations well then putting down the  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:06):**  compost is a mulch that's a really good way to suppress all of those weeds just make sure  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:11):**  it's a thick enough layer and then you've got to monitor it because a lot of times the  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:16):**  weather conditions are such that that thick nice thick layer of mulch is going to almost  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:22):**  disappear within you know two or three weeks and it's gone and you've lost your disease  
**[0:46:27-0:46:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:27):**  suppressive layer so you know get back out there and put the mulch on again put out the  
**[0:46:34-0:46:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:34):**  compost teas the compost extracts teas typically go on the foliage where you might certainly  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:42):**  if in the past you've had a problem with a disease or a pest of some kind protect the  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:48):**  above ground part of your plant um so that there's no surface that that disease or pest  
**[0:46:55-0:47:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:55):**  organism can attack um so they'll go someplace else they won't even recognize that your um  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:04):**  favorite crop is down there they're going to go elsewhere because those insects home  
**[0:47:11-0:47:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:11):**  in on the compounds that are released by sick and an unhealthy plant insects are looking  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:21):**  for something that's not doing well and so I've always thought of those insects as being  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:27):**  or those disease-causing fungi as being messages from mother nature about there's something  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:33):**  wrong with the plant there's something wrong with the soil it's not getting the nutrition  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:38):**  it's not getting the protective compounds so pay attention and if you don't pay attention  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:43):**  mother nature is going to take a bigger amount of your plants next year and the year after  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:48):**  it's going to be the whole acre and the year after that well you can grow something else  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:52):**  for the next period of time because you're not paying attention to what nature is trying  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:58):**  to tell you.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:00):**  Let's say you are in a crop rotation where you have a bed out of production for some  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:05):**  period of time you grow a cover crop in it and then you just rotate around between cover  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:10):**  crops and cash crops.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:12):**  In the cover crop beds how would you deal with that cover crop?  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:17):**  Do you think there's a preference here between when you go to terminate the cover crop you  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:21):**  could either one just mow it down or chop and drop it leave it in place to just decompose  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:27):**  on soil surface or option two would be when you want to terminate that cover crop you  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:32):**  can just cut it off at ground level leave the roots in the ground take the tops compost  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:38):**  them somewhere else and then reintroduce that compost back onto that plot.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:45):**  Yeah I'm always going to walk around both of those.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:49):**  I'm going to take the third option which is to not even have that cover crop step in the  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:57):**  rotation there is no need to do that if you're constantly growing this permanent perennial  
**[0:49:04-0:49:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:04):**  understory set of plants because they're putting back into the soil all of those organic matter  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:13):**  that your plants are going to need they're developing and building structure in that  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:19):**  soil so oxygen moves into the soil and goes as deep as it possibly can water infiltrates  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:25):**  such that half of all of those pores are filled with water the other half is filled with air  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:32):**  and you couldn't ask for a better soil if you can get that done.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:37):**  So I just don't even want to think about leaving a quarter of my land or half of my land in  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:47):**  a non without something growing in it that I can make money from as long as you're maintaining  
**[0:49:53-0:50:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:53):**  soil you don't have to do that you don't have to worry about crimping and mowing or plant  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:03):**  buying the seed every year you have to go out and buy those annual plants you put them  
**[0:50:09-0:50:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:09):**  in you get them to grow and then you chop them down doesn't that just seem kind of nonsensical?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:17):**  I'm with you it's a lot of work and there's a lot of challenges that go with cover crops  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:22):**  yet I think people see seeds and they hear people talk about cover crops and they think  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:26):**  that they have to do them or they should do them without fully thinking through why they're  
**[0:50:31-0:50:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:31):**  doing what they're doing when you do have an alternative like a perennial cover crop  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:36):**  and I love the idea of a perennial cover crop or probably better said a perennial ground  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:41):**  cover but I think there's challenges with a perennial ground cover it's something that's  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:46):**  kind of new when it comes to production systems it can potentially create problems with some  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:52):**  crops like low-lying crops lettuces and things like that you're not gonna be able to use  
**[0:50:56-0:51:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:56):**  a perennial ground cover with those do you know of any examples of production farms that  
**[0:51:03-0:51:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:03):**  have perennial ground covers in place alongside production cash crops like vegetables?  
**[0:51:12-0:51:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:12):**  On small scale yeah so quite you know quite a few people in California up in Massachusetts  
**[0:51:20-0:51:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:20):**  Iowa yeah various places but it it hasn't really taken off yet because I think most  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:27):**  people are going I'll switch because it certainly sounds easier but I want somebody else to  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:33):**  start to do it first and so we've got to get the innovators really clued into all of this  
**[0:51:38-0:51:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:38):**  and so like we're buying a farm for soil food web school working with other farms in various  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:46):**  places around the world that we are going to start doing this approach so come to the  
**[0:51:53-0:52:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:53):**  demos of where we're working you know we've got people in Holland and Switzerland and  
**[0:52:01-0:52:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:01):**  Germany and Portugal Sweden so well well represented in Europe we're working with people in Brazil  
**[0:52:12-0:52:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:12):**  in Ecuador and Costa Rica lots of different places so hopefully soon to be doing things  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:20):**  in Southeast Asia as well so it's come to the demo farms yeah come to the demo farms  
**[0:52:27-0:52:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:27):**  and and see what plants work for the different kinds of plants that were growing what the  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:35):**  crops are that were growing you can get a good idea and maybe even the mixture and that's  
**[0:52:41-0:52:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:41):**  another business we plan on establishing is we'll get the mixes going in our property  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:48):**  we'll harvest the seeds and then we'll sell local people will sell the seeds to I really  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:54):**  love the idea of these perennial ground covers because it just decreases work no tilling  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:59):**  less weeding you're always feeding the soil less composting you're really only composting  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:05):**  as needed with crop waste crop residue but by removing some of this composting from the  
**[0:53:12-0:53:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:12):**  system and by having perennial ground cover always in the system and by selling a cash  
**[0:53:20-0:53:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:20):**  crop how do you deal with nutrient replacement if you're selling a cash crop by default you're  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:28):**  exporting nutrients from your property because when the vegetables leave they take nutrients  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:33):**  that came out of the soil with them how do you get those nutrients back in the soil in  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:40):**  a perennial ground cover type situation where you're not adding a lot of compost to the  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:45):**  surface another way of asking that is what are your thoughts on soil remineralization  
**[0:53:51-0:54:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:51):**  and is it necessary because your soil is replenishing itself with all those nutrients by the fact  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:00):**  that the bacterium fungi use their acids they use their enzymes to break down pebbles and  
**[0:54:06-0:54:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:06):**  rocks and larger chunks and boulders and the bedrock is all being broken down and that  
**[0:54:14-0:54:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:14):**  means more sand silt clay particles are being replenished so you know you might be chewing  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:22):**  up some of the sand silt and clay and pulling all the nutrients out of them but down here  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:28):**  in the lower part of the soil you know whatever how whatever depth your soil is every second  
**[0:54:33-0:54:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:33):**  of every day more sand silt and clay are being made and so till the day that you've chewed  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:42):**  up all that sand silt and clay all of the organic matter because remember the organic  
**[0:54:47-0:54:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:47):**  matter has all those nutrients in it too already in the right balances so what's wrong with  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:55):**  growing plants in pure organic matter it's gonna it's got all the nutrients you just  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:02):**  have the biology you have to have that biology in order to pull those nutrients out of that  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:09):**  matrix that they're in pull it inside their bodies and then they've got to get eaten by  
**[0:55:13-0:55:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:13):**  the protozoa the nematodes the micro arthropods the earthworms all of those good kids and  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:19):**  that's what releases those nutrients in plant available forms right next to the root the  
**[0:55:24-0:55:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:24):**  root doesn't have to do any work it just can take up very simple right from the local surrounding  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:31):**  it doesn't have to try to transport that nitrogen from two feet away how long is it going to  
**[0:55:38-0:55:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:38):**  take that nitrogen to get to the root system if it's two feet away well you've got a dead  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:42):**  plant before it ever gets there so all of those nutrients are in the sand the silt the  
**[0:55:49-0:55:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:49):**  clays the rocks the pebbles and so when you think about that silica bilayer that all of  
**[0:55:56-0:56:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:56):**  these mineral components of the soil are built and in between that silica bilayer are all  
**[0:56:02-0:56:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:02):**  the nutrients have already been pulled inside those structures all you've got to have are  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:10):**  the bacterium fungi with their enzymes come along and pull out the specific nutrients  
**[0:56:15-0:56:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:15):**  that the plants asking for look i want boron i'll give you this food if you go out and  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:23):**  bring me back the boron and then you know over here it's saying i need more zinc i need  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:29):**  more iron the plant is telling that biology exactly what the plant needs and exactly what  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:35):**  the bacterium fungi should be beating them back for the plant what about replenishing  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:41):**  nitrogen in the system that's a big nutrient i think a lot of people freak out about where's  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:46):**  the nitrogen coming from it's especially for nitrogen we have a couple of alternative forms  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:53):**  of obtaining nitrogen straight from the atmosphere in terms of nitrogen fixation so if you have  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:00):**  any of the legumes if you've got any free living nitrogen fixers you those organisms  
**[0:57:07-0:57:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:07):**  can fix nitrogen and that's one of the things about soil scientists and the way they explain  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:15):**  the nitrogen cycle they forget to tell you about any of the biology any of the organisms  
**[0:57:21-0:57:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:21):**  that have to be there it is the organisms that do all the transformations of the nitrogen  
**[0:57:29-0:57:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:29):**  from n2 gas into amino acids that's the next step in the nitrogen cycle it you know you  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:38):**  always read these papers that say nitrate was produced and released into the soil by  
**[0:57:44-0:57:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:44):**  these nitrogen fixing microorganisms no that is not true that is not how it works they  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:54):**  forget a whole bunch of the biological steps that have to occur to convert from n2 into  
**[0:58:01-0:58:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:01):**  nh4 or no3 so i go through that whole nitrogen cycle and how it actually works and show people  
**[0:58:11-0:58:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:11):**  what organisms are required for each step along the way and you know it is one more  
**[0:58:19-0:58:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:19):**  form one more way to get that nitrogen into the soil in the proper form what's the balance  
**[0:58:27-0:58:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:27):**  nh4 no3 it is the microorganisms that determine what kind of plant you're going to be growing  
**[0:58:35-0:58:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:35):**  and so most of the time you don't have to have nitrogen fixing microorganisms to do  
**[0:58:45-0:58:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:45):**  that job legumes and free living nitrogen fixers you know the rhizobium and free living  
**[0:58:53-0:59:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:53):**  nitrogen fixers are a small part of that pool if you've got normal bacterium fungi doing  
**[0:59:02-0:59:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:02):**  what the plant tells them there is a massive amount of nitrogen present in the mineral  
**[0:59:10-0:59:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:10):**  forms of the soil in the sand, clay, rocks and pebbles etc your plant can live on that  
**[0:59:18-0:59:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:18):**  nitrogen you don't have to add the nitrogen fixation well you know but why not make one  
**[0:59:25-0:59:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:25):**  of your understory plants a legume of some kind grow some oh well any one of those nitrogen  
**[0:59:33-0:59:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:33):**  fixing plants grow them in that mix and you're just adding nitrogen icing on top of the cake.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:42):**  Shifting away from the perennial ground covers let's touch on compost one thing I see out  
**[0:59:47-0:59:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:47):**  there is a lot of compost usage probably more in the category of overusing compost applying  
**[0:59:55-1:00:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:55):**  deep thick layers four or six inches at a time sometimes several times a year what are  
**[1:00:01-1:00:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:01):**  your thoughts on using too much compost is there a point on the curve where the curve  
**[1:00:07-1:00:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:07):**  flattens out and you reach the law of diminishing returns where more isn't better and you could  
**[1:00:13-1:00:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:13):**  get the same results with less and you could actually get worse results by adding more?  
**[1:00:20-1:00:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:20):**  Most of the time I get my best production in pure compost so you know if you're adding  
**[1:00:29-1:00:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:29):**  two or three or five or six or two feet worth of compost into your beds is it going to be  
**[1:00:36-1:00:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:36):**  a real problem?  
**[1:00:38-1:00:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:38):**  Well the problem comes because they don't have the biology in that compost it is the  
**[1:00:46-1:00:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:46):**  microorganisms that form the structure which allow oxygen and water to move into that material  
**[1:00:55-1:01:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:55):**  and move all the way through if you have a massive downpour if you have a really wet  
**[1:01:01-1:01:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:01):**  springtime and it doesn't stop raining that whole pile of organic matter no matter how  
**[1:01:10-1:01:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:10):**  little it or big it is it's going to get totally water locked and that's the danger as soon  
**[1:01:17-1:01:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:17):**  as you reduce oxygen concentration in that compost or in the soil that's got a decent  
**[1:01:24-1:01:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:24):**  amount of organic matter in it those organisms are growing utilizing that organic matter  
**[1:01:30-1:01:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:30):**  but oxygen is not able to infiltrate through something that's water locked and so now you  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:36):**  go anaerobic all those beneficial organisms are going to go to sleep they're going to  
**[1:01:42-1:01:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:42):**  form dormant stages because they can't tolerate their enzymes won't work if there's too little  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:49):**  oxygen present if it's water locked oxygen cannot move through water very rapidly as  
**[1:01:55-1:02:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:55):**  all at all which is why you and I cannot live in the water not enough diffusion for us so  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:04):**  these organisms are going to go to sleep if they catch on that things are going south  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:09):**  that it's getting anaerobic they're going to produce dormant stages which means whenever  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:14):**  it does get aerobic again they'll be able to germinate and start to grow so they're  
**[1:02:19-1:02:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:19):**  just going to hang out until the conditions get better but as soon as those anaerobic  
**[1:02:24-1:02:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:24):**  organisms say well ho oxygen's disappearing I can germinate I can grow and now my enzymes  
**[1:02:33-1:02:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:33):**  will work because my enzymes are destroyed by oxygen and so now you start getting your  
**[1:02:42-1:02:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:42):**  nitrogen converted into ammonia and of course anybody who knows about ammonia trying to  
**[1:02:50-1:02:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:50):**  grow a plant it kills ammonia will directly kill your root system it will kill your above  
**[1:02:56-1:03:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:56):**  ground part of your plant so if your soil if your compost is going anaerobic you're  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:03):**  going to take all that wonderful nitrogen that's present in that compost or in that  
**[1:03:08-1:03:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:08):**  soil and start converting it to ammonia gas well you can smell that when that's happening  
**[1:03:16-1:03:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:16):**  your soil is going to be left with a really dark black color to it under anaerobic conditions  
**[1:03:23-1:03:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:23):**  the anaerobic microorganisms are going to use their enzymes to convert the sulfur that's  
**[1:03:30-1:03:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:30):**  in your soil the SO4, SO3, S2O3, S2O4 whatever form of sulfur you've got in your soil and  
**[1:03:40-1:03:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:40):**  they're going to convert that into hydrogen sulfide H2S that will kill your plants it  
**[1:03:49-1:03:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:49):**  leaves behind a dark color in your soil and of course you can smell that sulfur compound  
**[1:03:56-1:04:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:56):**  as it comes off of your soil it's you know the smell of sulfur smell wonderful rotten  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:05):**  egg that's what the word I was trying to think of rotten egg smell is what's going to be  
**[1:04:11-1:04:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:11):**  left so you're going to be losing all your nitrogen you're going to be losing all your  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:15):**  sulfur and finally you're going to lose all your phosphorus right PO4 is going to be converted  
**[1:04:21-1:04:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:21):**  into phosphine gas and you wave goodbye to all your nutrients and your plants going to  
**[1:04:29-1:04:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:29):**  be killed by the alcohol that's being produced or by the really low pH organic acids that  
**[1:04:36-1:04:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:36):**  are being produced people often say you know you you a pH of 4.5 is perfectly okay you  
**[1:04:46-1:04:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:46):**  want to grow blueberries in a soil of pH 4.5 no because the only way to reach a pH of 4.5  
**[1:04:55-1:05:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:55):**  in soil is for it to go anaerobic and that's going to all of these things contribute to  
**[1:05:04-1:05:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:04):**  the death of your plant exactly what killed your plant any one of these things so as soon  
**[1:05:11-1:05:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:11):**  as that goes waterlogged you're in trouble as soon as oxygen can't move into that soil  
**[1:05:17-1:05:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:17):**  so comes in the springtime that's often a problem that you you put on a lot of organic  
**[1:05:23-1:05:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:23):**  matter the organisms are growing really fast in there so it goes anaerobic really rapidly  
**[1:05:29-1:05:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:29):**  and you're going to lose your starts you're going to lose the plants that are in that  
**[1:05:33-1:05:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:33):**  material so don't make the mistake of blaming the compost for something that water logging  
**[1:05:42-1:05:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:42):**  was actually the culprit could you go the other way and use a lot less compost instead  
**[1:05:48-1:05:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:48):**  of using a lot of compost you're using less but you're using really high quality compost  
**[1:05:55-1:06:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:55):**  if the goal of good compost isn't just bulk organic matter but instead it's to inoculate  
**[1:06:02-1:06:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:02):**  the soil with good microbes then is it better to go with less high quality compost than  
**[1:06:09-1:06:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:09):**  more or a large volume of low quality compost yeah quality is going to give you a lot better  
**[1:06:17-1:06:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:17):**  result you want a massive diversity of these microorganisms in in the compost or in the  
**[1:06:25-1:06:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:25):**  tea or the extract made from that compost you want that massive diversity we don't know  
**[1:06:33-1:06:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:33):**  all the different conditions that are in your soil and we know that each species of bacteria  
**[1:06:40-1:06:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:40):**  fungi protozoa nematodes micro arthropods etc are very tuned to just a very limited  
**[1:06:48-1:06:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:48):**  set of conditions and they're only going to grow under this limited set of conditions  
**[1:06:53-1:07:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:53):**  as soon as the temperature moisture nutrient content whatever changes a lot of those individual  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:00):**  species are going to go to sleep but then a whole bunch of them that were there waiting  
**[1:07:05-1:07:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:05):**  for the right conditions they're going to wake up and they're going to start doing their  
**[1:07:09-1:07:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:09):**  jobs so we want to make sure we have this massive diversity so no matter what these  
**[1:07:15-1:07:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:15):**  changing conditions are doing there's always going to be some you know a couple thousand  
**[1:07:21-1:07:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:21):**  species of these organisms always functioning no matter what the conditions are conditions  
**[1:07:28-1:07:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:28):**  change these guys go to sleep but these guys wake up conditions change they go to sleep  
**[1:07:32-1:07:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:32):**  these guys wake up so we're maintaining the biomass of these organisms in the soil at  
**[1:07:39-1:07:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:39):**  consistent levels we do want to know that we've got massive diversity and again how  
**[1:07:44-1:07:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:44):**  do you know that well it's called your microscope take a look at them you want to be seen lots  
**[1:07:51-1:07:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:51):**  of different sizes and shapes of bacteria some of them should be motile some of them  
**[1:07:56-1:08:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:56):**  will just be sitting there kind of bobbling in the water but you see that you've got a  
**[1:08:02-1:08:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:02):**  massive diversity of different sizes and shapes now some of them like to chain up some of  
**[1:08:08-1:08:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:08):**  them like to make little picket fences all of that diversity you want to see in your  
**[1:08:12-1:08:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:12):**  soil with your fungi same thing with the protozoa same thing with the nematodes same thing you  
**[1:08:19-1:08:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:19):**  want to see that diversity and so if we're putting in high quality compost as an inoculum  
**[1:08:25-1:08:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:25):**  we're adding all that massive diversity how do you know that all this biology is going  
**[1:08:34-1:08:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:34):**  to be able to take care of all the conditions that will change through the whole entire  
**[1:08:39-1:08:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:39):**  growing season we've got to make sure that we've got those organisms in there if mother  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:45):**  nature decides to make this a hot dry summer we need those organisms that are going to  
**[1:08:51-1:08:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:51):**  live under those conditions and do their job for your plant what if it's going to be a  
**[1:08:56-1:09:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:56):**  cold wet summer well then you need all those organisms in your compost too just to make  
**[1:09:02-1:09:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:02):**  sure that you've you're going to have all of the organisms all of the functions of those  
**[1:09:08-1:09:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:08):**  organisms are going to occur no matter what the conditions well what if you have think  
**[1:09:13-1:09:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:13):**  of all the combinations that you have in your soil and you want to make certain that all  
**[1:09:19-1:09:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:19):**  of these organisms are present that can do the work under whatever conditions we need  
**[1:09:25-1:09:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:25):**  something around 75,000 species of bacteria that's not individuals that's species of bacteria  
**[1:09:35-1:09:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:35):**  so that you always know that somebody's going to be in there taking care of the job doing  
**[1:09:40-1:09:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:40):**  the job for you you want to have about 25,000 different species of fungi and all the good  
**[1:09:48-1:09:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:48):**  guys not the bad guys I'm not talking bad guys here I'm talking good guys they all have  
**[1:09:53-1:09:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:53):**  to have aerobic conditions in order to do their jobs they all have to have food they  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:59):**  all will wake up and go to sleep as required through the course of summer based on the  
**[1:10:04-1:10:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:04):**  conditions that nature is sending us that's where you can know that your soil is really  
**[1:10:09-1:10:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:09):**  going to be healthy if you don't have that diversity there could be you know two to three  
**[1:10:15-1:10:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:15):**  months where your plant has no support personnel taking care of it.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:21):**  So when I think about high quality compost I think about it as an inoculant I think you  
**[1:10:25-1:10:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:25):**  want a lot of diversity of microorganisms and a lot of those microorganisms one thing  
**[1:10:32-1:10:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:32):**  you have me thinking of though is seasonality and how seasons change and how micro populations  
**[1:10:38-1:10:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:38):**  change throughout the seasons if you were making compost over a certain period of time  
**[1:10:45-1:10:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:45):**  a short period of time during the year is there a chance that you would only have microbes  
**[1:10:50-1:10:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:50):**  that are active during that time of the year so when you add them to your soil you're missing  
**[1:10:56-1:11:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:56):**  out on organisms that would otherwise enter a pile if a pile sat there year round if a  
**[1:11:03-1:11:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:03):**  soil is going to need organisms in the ground year round don't you want to be adding organisms  
**[1:11:08-1:11:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:08):**  in your compost that were there throughout the year?  
**[1:11:13-1:11:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:13):**  Well actually mother nature is sneakier than that because where does the original inoculum  
**[1:11:19-1:11:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:19):**  of organisms that are going to be in your compost pile where do they come from?  
**[1:11:24-1:11:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:24):**  They come from the organic matter that you're putting into the pile and so you don't want  
**[1:11:29-1:11:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:29):**  to be making a compost pile out of you know 50 percent straw and 50 percent manure and  
**[1:11:37-1:11:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:37):**  I've gone to composting operations where they say that's the best way to make compost and  
**[1:11:44-1:11:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:44):**  I just shudder to think about the lack of diversity in that straw and manure how many  
**[1:11:51-1:11:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:51):**  good guys are in manure?  
**[1:11:52-1:11:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:52):**  Well not many how about on straw?  
**[1:11:57-1:12:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:57):**  Well okay you're going to get some but nowhere near the diversity that you're going to need  
**[1:12:02-1:12:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:02):**  so now how would you improve the diversity instead of you know 50 percent straw 50 percent  
**[1:12:09-1:12:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:09):**  manure and I would probably recommend only 20 percent manure and I would want to make  
**[1:12:15-1:12:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:15):**  it a couple of different kinds of manure let's not just get stuck with now stinky smelly  
**[1:12:20-1:12:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:20):**  sloppy manure you know could we understand that signal when we're dealing with a animal  
**[1:12:29-1:12:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:29):**  that's got diarrhea is that a healthy animal?  
**[1:12:33-1:12:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:33):**  No you don't have the good guy organisms in here you're going to have to do a lot to kill  
**[1:12:39-1:12:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:39):**  the bad guys that are coming to you in that form so I want some chicken manure I want  
**[1:12:44-1:12:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:44):**  some goat manure I'd like maybe some llama manure in there as well and then other plant  
**[1:12:50-1:12:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:50):**  materials so you don't even have to use manure if you don't want to but if you do you're  
**[1:12:57-1:13:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:57):**  adding an improved diversity let's get some alfalfa let's get some you know spent grains  
**[1:13:04-1:13:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:04):**  from brewing beer let's a huge diversity but that's only going to be 10 to 20 percent of  
**[1:13:11-1:13:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:11):**  my pile now I'm going to go get some green stuff so straight out of your garden all where  
**[1:13:16-1:13:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:16):**  you've harvested all your peas take that green plant material that's going to grow bacteria  
**[1:13:21-1:13:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:21):**  really well well how about cutting some of your grass okay so now I've got lawn clippings  
**[1:13:27-1:13:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:27):**  well maybe we really want to go out to that hayfield because there's a lot of different  
**[1:13:32-1:13:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:32):**  kinds of plant materials there's not just grass but there's forbs and herbs in there  
**[1:13:39-1:13:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:39):**  as well so as much diversity well all your kitchen scraps should go into your compost  
**[1:13:46-1:13:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:46):**  because now there's a huge diversity of other kinds of materials so kelp and lettuces and  
**[1:13:53-1:13:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:53):**  tomatoes and all that remnant material think of all the different diversity of bacteria  
**[1:13:58-1:14:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:58):**  and fungi that will be on there and protozoa and nematodes and most people don't like to  
**[1:14:04-1:14:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:04):**  think of the fact that there ought to be nematodes on the surface of your tomato and you ought  
**[1:14:09-1:14:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:09):**  to eat that tomato raw because you're re-inoculating your own biome with all these beneficial organisms  
**[1:14:18-1:14:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:18):**  so you know I often say to people when you know that it's really good compost stick your  
**[1:14:22-1:14:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:22):**  hands in there get a feel for it and then lick them right right because you're putting  
**[1:14:27-1:14:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:27):**  all that wonderful diversity of microorganisms back into yourself that you require so making  
**[1:14:35-1:14:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:35):**  diversity to go in yes then does time play a factor curing time curing time generally  
**[1:14:43-1:14:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:43):**  starts the fungi growing and starting to win a bit more early on in the composting process  
**[1:14:51-1:14:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:51):**  because you're going to turn it so many times and every time you turn that compost you're  
**[1:14:56-1:15:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:56):**  slicing and dicing and crushing your fungi your protozoa your nematodes your micro arthropods  
**[1:15:03-1:15:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:03):**  usually micro arthropods after a turn they're all going like no way we're out of here we're  
**[1:15:08-1:15:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:08):**  gone not coming back so you got to leave that pile alone you got to let it mature if you  
**[1:15:16-1:15:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:16):**  want the micro arthropods to come back in if you want the really good nematodes to come  
**[1:15:20-1:15:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:20):**  back you've got to give time for those fungi to grow through your compost again and all  
**[1:15:25-1:15:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:25):**  those strands start to get you know you're going from here's my bacteria here's my fungi  
**[1:15:32-1:15:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:32):**  and through that curing system curing time those fungi are coming up and up and up so  
**[1:15:42-1:15:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:42):**  how much good fungal foods did you have how many good bacterial foods did you have you  
**[1:15:48-1:15:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:48):**  have to go back to your soil and determine what's missing in your soil how do you know  
**[1:15:57-1:16:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:57):**  the kind of compost you need to make if you don't know what's missing in your soil if  
**[1:16:04-1:16:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:04):**  what you're missing is fungi you only have disease-causing fungi in your soil so your  
**[1:16:11-1:16:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:11):**  fungi way down here and your bacteria are up this high you got a lot of work to do and  
**[1:16:19-1:16:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:19):**  you better make a compost that's almost strictly fungal well that's hard to do so you do the  
**[1:16:25-1:16:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:25):**  best that you can you get the fungi increased as great as you can but now in a year or two  
**[1:16:32-1:16:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:32):**  do you still want to be making very fungal compost look at what's in your soil and that  
**[1:16:40-1:16:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:40):**  tells you what you need to be adding and so now you see that I'm trying to grow tomatoes  
**[1:16:46-1:16:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:46):**  and yet my fungal biomass is here and my bacterial biomass is here that's not what we want for  
**[1:16:52-1:16:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:52):**  tomatoes we want this so now what do I do in my compost pile I put more green material  
**[1:16:59-1:17:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:59):**  in because that's bacterial food and you get that ratio of bacteria and fungi back to what  
**[1:17:05-1:17:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:05):**  it needs to be to grow your really healthy crop and you've only had to go out there once  
**[1:17:12-1:17:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:12):**  to fix the problem.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:14):**  So you create the compost that you need and you see a lot of people trying to speed up  
**[1:17:18-1:17:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:18):**  compost compost in 30 days and that compost could be great compost in theory if that's  
**[1:17:25-1:17:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:25):**  what your soil needs.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:27):**  Yep and if you know for the when you're first making compost and you're kind of in this  
**[1:17:33-1:17:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:33):**  I've got to get this compost in before I plan my plans so I've got to hurry hurry hurry  
**[1:17:38-1:17:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:38):**  and I forgot to get started I forgot to okay so we want to hurry along the process of making  
**[1:17:45-1:17:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:45):**  compost so it's a 21 day process if you really push it it's a 21 day process to bring that  
**[1:17:52-1:17:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:52):**  temperature right back down to ambient.  
**[1:17:55-1:17:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:55):**  Do you really have as much diversity as you could have?  
**[1:17:59-1:18:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:59):**  Well way better than the diversity that's in your dirt so get started with the process  
**[1:18:07-1:18:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:07):**  but after you've gotten started and things are starting to get balanced and now not so  
**[1:18:14-1:18:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:14):**  much work to do now let that pile mature longer now make a compost this spring that you're  
**[1:18:23-1:18:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:23):**  not actually going to put on until after harvest next fall.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:28):**  Now if you made a compost last November and you're just putting it out now check it make  
**[1:18:37-1:18:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:37):**  sure that it's got really good fungi in it that what you want is there and because you  
**[1:18:43-1:18:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:43):**  can always alter it by putting in the right kinds of foods.  
**[1:18:47-1:18:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:47):**  Yeah that makes a lot of sense when we think about adding compost to the soil we're adding  
**[1:18:53-1:18:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:53):**  organic matter to the soil and when you think about organic matter that's one measure that  
**[1:18:57-1:19:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:57):**  a lot of people use to judge their soil they say I started at 1% organic matter and now  
**[1:19:03-1:19:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:03):**  I'm at 5% organic matter.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:06):**  What are your thoughts about evaluating soil quality based upon the percent organic matter  
**[1:19:12-1:19:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:12):**  in that soil?  
**[1:19:14-1:19:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:14):**  You can get tricked by relying on just that one thing it's like relying on temperature  
**[1:19:21-1:19:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:21):**  to tell you whether you're healthy or not.  
**[1:19:24-1:19:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:24):**  Well your body temperature is not going to be increased when you're dying of cancer sorry  
**[1:19:30-1:19:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:30):**  it's only good for certain things soil organic matter is good for certain types of information  
**[1:19:38-1:19:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:38):**  but it doesn't tell you what's going to be going on with the biology.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:45):**  We hope that when we put in fungal foods that it's going to feed a whole bunch of fungi  
**[1:19:50-1:19:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:50):**  and fungal biomass is going to increase what if you have no fungal spores what if there  
**[1:19:56-1:20:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:56):**  aren't any fungi in the compost or no fungi in your soil so you put in fungal foods it's  
**[1:20:04-1:20:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:04):**  kind of like going out into the middle of the Sahara Desert and putting down the most  
**[1:20:09-1:20:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:09):**  incredible smorgasbord that anybody's ever seen on this planet nobody's there to eat  
**[1:20:17-1:20:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:17):**  it so what good did it do?  
**[1:20:22-1:20:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:22):**  Same thing with our compost you've got to make certain that we have really good fungi  
**[1:20:27-1:20:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:27):**  in that pile especially if we're putting in lots of good fungal foods for those organisms  
**[1:20:34-1:20:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:34):**  so be checking your starting materials and making sure you got some good fungi and when  
**[1:20:38-1:20:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:38):**  in doubt go out someplace and take just the smallest tiniest little hand of something  
**[1:20:45-1:20:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:45):**  that's got some good fungal strands in it you don't need much we do not need to be destroying  
**[1:20:52-1:20:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:52):**  our ancient forests in order to build you a better compost pile so only take a very  
**[1:20:58-1:21:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:58):**  small about put that spread that through your compost pile at the beginning of the composting  
**[1:21:04-1:21:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:04):**  process so that if there were any diseases or pests in that little handful you're going  
**[1:21:11-1:21:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:11):**  to deal with them if you look at your compost at the end of the composting process and you  
**[1:21:20-1:21:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:20):**  can see that there's not a lot of really good fungi in there you'll probably want to go  
**[1:21:25-1:21:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:25):**  out and buy some inocula so go out and get some turkey tail go out and get some oyster  
**[1:21:30-1:21:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:30):**  mushroom go out and get whatever mushroom you want or one of the spent blocks from a  
**[1:21:35-1:21:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:35):**  mushroom farm just make sure they don't autoclave it before they send it sell it to you you  
**[1:21:42-1:21:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:42):**  add that into your compost pile so you can always go to your grocery store and buy those  
**[1:21:47-1:21:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:47):**  mushrooms you can go buy the blocks from someplace that's not going to autoclave them so that  
**[1:21:56-1:22:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:56):**  you can be adding inoculum that you know has no disease or pest organisms in it so you're  
**[1:22:05-1:22:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:05):**  not giving yourself a worse headache than if you hadn't put any of that inoculum in  
**[1:22:12-1:22:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:12):**  so always building that material.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:17):**  Focusing on organic matter for a second what are your thoughts on organic matter and that  
**[1:22:21-1:22:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:21):**  potentially being too high in the soil is there a point at which you would say there's  
**[1:22:27-1:22:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:27):**  too much organic matter here's where I'm going with this line of thinking if you have too  
**[1:22:32-1:22:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:32):**  much organic matter that tells me that the biology in the soil isn't consuming that organic  
**[1:22:38-1:22:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:38):**  matter if it's just piling up and up and up you're adding it but you're not taking it  
**[1:22:44-1:22:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:44):**  out of the system by the biology in the soil which leads me to believe that that soil might  
**[1:22:50-1:22:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:50):**  not be as healthy as the organic matter percent would lead you to believe what are your thoughts  
**[1:22:56-1:23:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:56):**  on organic matter being too high and just having too much organic matter.  
**[1:23:01-1:23:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:01):**  And the only way you're going to know whether there's enough biology to be doing the proper  
**[1:23:07-1:23:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:07):**  decomposition process is to use your microscope.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:11):**  Are the organism numbers dense enough?  
**[1:23:14-1:23:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:14):**  Because you can put on a miles worth of organic matter no organisms it's just next time it  
**[1:23:23-1:23:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:23):**  rains it's going to get waterlogged and now it's going to cause you a horrible problem  
**[1:23:29-1:23:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:29):**  so you've got to have all components within the system or the system can't work so yeah  
**[1:23:37-1:23:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:37):**  make certain that you've got the organisms in the compost.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:41):**  I go out to a lot of forests these days and I look at the what's on the surface of the  
**[1:23:47-1:23:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:47):**  forest floor and I see you know two or three inches worth of dead leaf material just sitting  
**[1:23:55-1:24:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:55):**  on the forest floor go back a year from now now all that is is you've got three and a  
**[1:24:01-1:24:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:01):**  half inches next year it's four inches next year it's four and a half and it just keeps  
**[1:24:08-1:24:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:08):**  getting deeper and deeper and what that tells me is there are absolutely no fungi in that  
**[1:24:15-1:24:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:15):**  in this poor forest this is a dead dying forest that I'm walking through and it's a you know  
**[1:24:24-1:24:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:24):**  tears at your heartstrings to realize that you're walking through something that probably  
**[1:24:30-1:24:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:30):**  human beings destroyed because of drift of toxic chemicals because somebody came in and  
**[1:24:36-1:24:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:36):**  said oh these poor trees aren't growing very rapidly let's put out an inorganic fertilizer  
**[1:24:41-1:24:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:41):**  and they absolutely killed all of the biology that makes that old growth forest be an old  
**[1:24:48-1:24:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:48):**  growth forest so we have to make certain that the whole system is functioning make sure  
**[1:24:56-1:25:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:56):**  that you've got the microorganisms well if this is an old growth forest I better be seeing  
**[1:25:01-1:25:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:01):**  bacteria and fungi in the proper balances I need to see protozoa bacterial feeders strictly  
**[1:25:07-1:25:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:07):**  bacterial feeders for the most part I need to see some protozoa but I don't want to see  
**[1:25:14-1:25:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:14):**  really high levels because the fungi and the fungal feeders should be the things that are  
**[1:25:20-1:25:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:20):**  really high in numbers I want to see my fungi really high when I pick up a handful of that  
**[1:25:26-1:25:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:26):**  soil and break it open lots of good fungal strands in there but then I also want to be  
**[1:25:32-1:25:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:32):**  seeing the nematodes in there and I want to be seeing the micro arthropods whose function  
**[1:25:39-1:25:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:39):**  is to eat that fungi releasing the nutrients so the plants can grow I want to see earthworms  
**[1:25:48-1:25:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:48):**  I want to see in catraids I want to see spiders and I want to everything should be present  
**[1:25:54-1:25:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:54):**  so this can function properly so it's not just organic matter we can't use that as the  
**[1:25:58-1:26:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:58):**  sole determinant of whether this system is healthy or not we've got to be looking at  
**[1:26:04-1:26:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:04):**  the biology as well let's say I wanted to add more fungi to the soil I wanted to increase  
**[1:26:10-1:26:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:10):**  the fungi relative to the bacteria in the soil and let's say this is good garden soil  
**[1:26:17-1:26:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:17):**  it's not some burned out row crop field and let's say I'm adding a compost that I think  
**[1:26:23-1:26:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:23):**  has a high amount of fungi in it when I introduce that compost to the soil I'm inoculating that  
**[1:26:30-1:26:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:30):**  soil with fungi can I assume that that soil has enough food for those fungi to survive  
**[1:26:38-1:26:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:38):**  or am I potentially just adding a bunch of fungi that aren't going to have a food supply  
**[1:26:44-1:26:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:44):**  and they're just either going to die or go dormant because they don't have what they  
**[1:26:49-1:26:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:49):**  need to thrive and proliferate in the soil so should I think about adding the inoculant  
**[1:26:54-1:26:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:54):**  the compost along with a fungal food at the same time  
**[1:26:58-1:27:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:58):**  again as the microscope is the easiest tool to tell you if you're the fun job that you've  
**[1:27:05-1:27:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:05):**  added to the system are still growing you can also be looking at decomposition rate  
**[1:27:11-1:27:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:11):**  of the fungal foods they should be disappearing if you've got that adequate fungal biomass  
**[1:27:19-1:27:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:19):**  functioning in that material is the root mass from previous crops a fungal food typically  
**[1:27:26-1:27:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:26):**  yes it's more on the fungal side than it is on the bacterial side because the plant is  
**[1:27:31-1:27:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:31):**  typically going to be storing nutrients in that root system that are in a form that's  
**[1:27:41-1:27:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:41):**  long term storage so it's protected by being structurally very difficult to break down  
**[1:27:48-1:27:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:48):**  or the bacteria would break in and wipe out those root systems during the winter time  
**[1:27:54-1:28:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:54):**  so roots tend to be more on that fungal side it depends on exactly which kind of plant  
**[1:28:00-1:28:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:00):**  you're looking at you know you you when you look at root systems of the most rapidly growing  
**[1:28:06-1:28:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:06):**  plants like kudzu on this planet their root systems grow so rapidly they're very juicy  
**[1:28:14-1:28:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:14):**  very tender and they tend to be more bacterial food than fungal food so there there's some  
**[1:28:20-1:28:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:20):**  variation there what's the carbon to nitrogen ratio things that have a cden ratio up around  
**[1:28:27-1:28:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:27):**  20-25 there's going to be a goodly amount of bacterial food in there when we look at  
**[1:28:34-1:28:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:34):**  perennial plants their fungal their carbon nitrogen ratios are typically up more around  
**[1:28:40-1:28:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:40):**  100-150 more fungal food so probably the easiest way for human beings to look at that is oh  
**[1:28:49-1:28:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:49):**  these are nice white kind of you know succulent root systems versus ooh these have got just  
**[1:28:56-1:29:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:56):**  like a bark on them there's a outside layer that's highly suberized and that's going to  
**[1:29:03-1:29:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:03):**  be more fungal food the fungi take care of that the bacteria take care of the simple  
**[1:29:08-1:29:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:08):**  white roots probably the short term long term crops correlate a radish might be in the ground  
**[1:29:13-1:29:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:13):**  for 30 days you're going to leave less root versus a tomato which is in the ground for  
**[1:29:18-1:29:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:18):**  150 days more roots different type of roots yep and they have to protect themselves in  
**[1:29:25-1:29:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:25):**  order not to be eaten by the bacteria we've already established that you're a big fan  
**[1:29:31-1:29:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:31):**  of perennial ground cover that feeds the soil while the plant lives above surface let's  
**[1:29:37-1:29:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:37):**  say i didn't use a perennial ground cover but i just had crops growing in the soil all  
**[1:29:43-1:29:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:43):**  the time so they're putting root exudates into the soil and they're feeding the soil  
**[1:29:48-1:29:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:48):**  that way they're my cash crops is that enough to feed the soil or would i get additional  
**[1:29:55-1:30:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:55):**  benefit to the soil by putting something on top of it like a straw mulch i'm obviously  
**[1:30:01-1:30:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:01):**  going to do things like save water and maybe cool the soil down by adding the mulch but  
**[1:30:06-1:30:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:06):**  am i feeding the soil more and is that really that much better than just keeping a constant  
**[1:30:12-1:30:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:12):**  crop in the soil where the roots of the crop are feeding the soil um straw is going to  
**[1:30:19-1:30:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:19):**  be fungal food more than than it is bacterial food so if that's what you need to be pushing  
**[1:30:25-1:30:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:25):**  fungal biomass the straw might work for that particular process quite well protecting the  
**[1:30:31-1:30:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:31):**  soil surface but once the fungi get going on that straw the fungi are going to decompose  
**[1:30:38-1:30:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:38):**  that now you're left with no protection if you're growing a some kind of living surface  
**[1:30:46-1:30:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:46):**  material maybe not perennial you've chosen something that grows typically in a fungal  
**[1:30:54-1:31:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:54):**  the bacterial biomass ratio close to one to one so it's you know it's got some fungal  
**[1:31:01-1:31:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:01):**  foods in that material but um still a little bit more on the bacterial dominant side um  
**[1:31:09-1:31:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:09):**  as long as those are the plants that you want to be you know you want to put in tomatoes  
**[1:31:17-1:31:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:17):**  potatoes and things like that into those kinds of beds um then that's a that's a good match  
**[1:31:24-1:31:29](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:24):**  for what you do want to be growing there but if you wanted to grow blueberries in there  
**[1:31:29-1:31:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:29):**  you wanted to grow apricots or mango or something like that um not going to give you the best  
**[1:31:38-1:31:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:38):**  response so it's there's no kind of one single answer people always ask me what what's the  
**[1:31:48-1:31:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:48):**  best compost to make and my response has always got to be it depends what are you trying to  
**[1:31:55-1:32:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:55):**  grow what's missing in your soil are these the best plant cover that i could have what's  
**[1:32:00-1:32:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:00):**  the best elaine tell me what to do and i'm sorry nature doesn't work that way you're  
**[1:32:06-1:32:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:06):**  going to have to use your own brain yeah you've got to pay attention you've got to be talking  
**[1:32:12-1:32:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:12):**  to mother nature and the way she talks to us is by what's going on in that soil what's  
**[1:32:17-1:32:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:17):**  going on with your plants so we have to learn how to interpret those signals which means  
**[1:32:24-1:32:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:24):**  you can't be really you can't be a lazy farmer you gotta pay attention to what mother nature's  
**[1:32:34-1:32:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:34):**  telling you so in terms of quality compost you've looked at a lot of compost on farms  
**[1:32:40-1:32:46](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:40):**  you've made a lot of compost you've looked at a lot of composts under the microscope  
**[1:32:46-1:32:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:46):**  what are your thoughts on biodynamic compost it gets a lot of hype a lot of people believe  
**[1:32:52-1:32:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:52):**  in it a lot of people really advocate for it is that compost better than their average  
**[1:32:58-1:33:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:58):**  compost and is it all that it's cracked up to be there's there's nothing that does it  
**[1:33:05-1:33:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:05):**  all for all conditions all places all crops etc um it's you've got to fine-tune it more  
**[1:33:14-1:33:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:14):**  than that um and you know robert um steiner came up with systems that worked really well  
**[1:33:24-1:33:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:24):**  for the part of the world that he was working in he was paying attention to what mother  
**[1:33:31-1:33:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:31):**  nature was telling him and now how do you get those concepts across to the general public  
**[1:33:38-1:33:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:38):**  and so he tried very hard to do that it's his followers that really take what he was  
**[1:33:45-1:33:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:45):**  talking about and turn it into this um hardcore this is the way steiner said it has to be  
**[1:33:53-1:34:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:53):**  doing be done it's you know page 25 it says this is what you have to do when he was probably  
**[1:34:02-1:34:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:02):**  my belief is that he was probably trying to answer somebody's specific question about  
**[1:34:10-1:34:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:10):**  what was going to work and best in their land under their conditions in their climate yada  
**[1:34:16-1:34:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:16):**  yada and it just gets too hardline when people do that and it scares me a lot when when i  
**[1:34:24-1:34:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:24):**  think about you know people um being proponents of what i do and they get just a little too  
**[1:34:32-1:34:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:32):**  rigid everything's got to have this well no the the the sentence we should always be using  
**[1:34:44-1:34:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:44):**  is it depends take a look at the system what's lacking what are you trying to grow what are  
**[1:34:52-1:34:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:52):**  the weather conditions where you are we're going to do different things in islam than  
**[1:34:57-1:35:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:57):**  we're going to do in panama period full stop across the line well it's not the same crops  
**[1:35:04-1:35:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:04):**  in those two places it's um you know you're going to got freezing soil most of the year  
**[1:35:10-1:35:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:10):**  in island you never have freezing conditions in panama so the overarching principles are  
**[1:35:21-1:35:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:21):**  the same everywhere on the planet but they have to be interpreted for the place and time  
**[1:35:31-1:35:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:31):**  so at the end of the day would you pay money a lot of money to get like this much inoculant  
**[1:35:38-1:35:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:38):**  to add to a compost pile do you think that you're going to get the results would you  
**[1:35:42-1:35:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:42):**  pay the money probably not i would multiply it see what i would do is take that inoculum  
**[1:35:49-1:35:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:49):**  put it into a compost mix find out what's really what's the inoculum what's in that  
**[1:35:55-1:36:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:55):**  inoculum is it just bacterial does it have the fungi does it have the protozoa does it  
**[1:36:00-1:36:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:00):**  have the nematodes and i would be willing to bet you that you don't find any inoculum  
**[1:36:06-1:36:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:06):**  that comes in a little tiny container like that that has the whole food web in it those  
**[1:36:12-1:36:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:12):**  are probably a couple of species of bacteria in there if you're lucky there might be some  
**[1:36:18-1:36:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:18):**  fungi but you know it's like with dr jika's work in japan he isolated a certain set of  
**[1:36:27-1:36:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:27):**  microorganisms that do very well in preventing club root on cauliflower coal and kale crops  
**[1:36:39-1:36:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:39):**  but it doesn't really work for other kinds of crops with different diseases in different  
**[1:36:48-1:36:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:48):**  climates lactobacillus is mainly what he he isolated i think it was like five or six different  
**[1:36:57-1:37:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:57):**  species of lactobacillus a couple species of pseudomonas a couple species of bacillus  
**[1:37:07-1:37:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:07):**  a couple of other species of non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacterium which i love the  
**[1:37:17-1:37:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:17):**  name of that organism because it's like this long and that's what's in his inoculum well  
**[1:37:25-1:37:34](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:25):**  it it does great for brassicas in a soil that's not bacterial enough that doesn't have enough  
**[1:37:34-1:37:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:34):**  actinomyces in it or actinobacteria sorry the old-fashioned name actinomycetes but they  
**[1:37:41-1:37:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:41):**  are bacteria so they're actually actinobacteria it doesn't do much if you have a tomato that's  
**[1:37:49-1:38:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:49):**  being attacked by fusarium not going to shut that down at all so you've got to start understanding  
**[1:38:01-1:38:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:01):**  what is the problem that your plants got what's not present in the soil what's missing and  
**[1:38:08-1:38:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:08):**  therefore i know what i need to do a lot of times we'll use biocontrol agents to start  
**[1:38:18-1:38:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:18):**  dealing with the problem so i have an outbreak of verticillium on my potatoes i'm going to  
**[1:38:24-1:38:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:24):**  make up a compost tea where i am going to put a teaspoon of spores of trichoderma into  
**[1:38:33-1:38:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:33):**  that compost tea and i know that in the next 24 hours all of those spores in that compost  
**[1:38:40-1:38:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:40):**  tea are going to germinate and they're going to start to grow if you didn't have the rest  
**[1:38:44-1:38:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:44):**  of the organisms in that water those trichoderma spores would never germinate they would never  
**[1:38:51-1:39:00](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:51):**  be growing so you've got to have the biology to get this reaction all of the trichoderma  
**[1:39:00-1:39:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:00):**  are now growing i spray that out each one of those spores that comes anywhere near to  
**[1:39:07-1:39:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:07):**  a verticillium hypha now grows that the trichoderma hypha grows into the hypha of the verticillium  
**[1:39:16-1:39:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:16):**  and eats the verticillium out from the inside out and within a day or two that whole verticillium  
**[1:39:26-1:39:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:26):**  plague just disappears we can do the same thing for fusarium we can do the same thing  
**[1:39:32-1:39:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:32):**  for any one of the omicids any one of the disease-causing fungi so we'll start off perhaps  
**[1:39:41-1:39:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:41):**  with that step that solves the outbreak problem but now because the trichoderma has been in  
**[1:39:49-1:39:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:49):**  there and it's attacked any fungus not just for the psyllium not just for xerium not just  
**[1:39:57-1:40:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:57):**  any one of those other disease-causing fungi it's wiped them all out the good guys as well  
**[1:40:03-1:40:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:03):**  as the bad so how are we going to manage to keep growing the tomatoes or keep growing  
**[1:40:10-1:40:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:10):**  the cauliflower or keep growing whatever plant it was we've got to put back an inoculum of  
**[1:40:17-1:40:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:17):**  those beneficial organisms that were wiped out by the biocontrol agent that we used so  
**[1:40:24-1:40:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:24):**  we'll come back in another 24 hours well typically we leave about two weeks for the trichoderma  
**[1:40:31-1:40:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:31):**  to get over itself it has there's no more fungi no more food so it goes dormant produces  
**[1:40:38-1:40:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:38):**  spores the spores don't germinate and start to grow unless they're in a compost tea with  
**[1:40:44-1:40:49](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:44):**  all those other microorganisms so all those spores of the trichoderma they're sitting  
**[1:40:49-1:40:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:49):**  out in that ecosystem that most of them are not going to germinate most of them are going  
**[1:40:54-1:40:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:54):**  to hang out and wait until the very specific conditions they need in order to grow are  
**[1:40:59-1:41:05](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:59):**  met so we don't have to worry about them now now we go out and we put out an inoculum of  
**[1:41:05-1:41:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:05):**  really good fungi we replenish the organisms that got wiped out by the biocontrol agent  
**[1:41:11-1:41:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:11):**  and your system comes back into a condition of health so you've got to understand these  
**[1:41:18-1:41:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:18):**  kinds of subtle interactions and we go through a lot of that in the foundation courses at  
**[1:41:28-1:41:36](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:28):**  so food web school so that people get that experience we have a section of success stories  
**[1:41:36-1:41:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:36):**  that people can go to and and look what did this person do under these conditions to get  
**[1:41:42-1:41:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:42):**  this success story so accumulating more and more of those kinds of stories gives people  
**[1:41:50-1:41:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:50):**  better and better ideas of what they need to do to fix every particular problem that  
**[1:41:57-1:42:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:57):**  they have what about mycorrhizal fungi would you think about adding those to a system at  
**[1:42:04-1:42:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:04):**  the very beginning they can only survive when they're near living roots so you would have  
**[1:42:09-1:42:14](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:09):**  to plant them at the same time you planted a crop and do you think that they could survive  
**[1:42:14-1:42:21](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:14):**  in the soil in between crop rotations or come winter where you wouldn't have to re-inoculate  
**[1:42:21-1:42:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:21):**  the soil again with them i would want to use my microscope and make sure that they act  
**[1:42:27-1:42:35](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:27):**  those root systems are actually colonized and so by putting your washing your roots  
**[1:42:35-1:42:42](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:35):**  off putting them on your microscope and illuminating them either using an epifluorescent microscope  
**[1:42:42-1:42:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:42):**  or just taking a handheld uv lamp and illuminating that root system you should be able to see  
**[1:42:48-1:42:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:48):**  the fluorescent arbus skills in that root system and then you know that it's colonized  
**[1:42:55-1:43:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:55):**  there's no question you're not trying to guess so if you've got dirt absolutely putting in  
**[1:43:04-1:43:11](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:04):**  a mycorrhizal inoculum is a very good idea but you don't want to put it out in just mix  
**[1:43:11-1:43:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:11):**  it into the soil because you know you've only got a few million spores in any packet typically  
**[1:43:19-1:43:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:19):**  that you're getting and you've got to make sure that those spores are associated with  
**[1:43:24-1:43:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:24):**  the root system and if you just mix the spores into the soil or into the dirt you're probably  
**[1:43:31-1:43:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:31):**  not going to get any or very few of those spores are actually going to get within 10  
**[1:43:38-1:43:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:38):**  micrometers of that root system that's about the distance that the spore has to be for  
**[1:43:45-1:43:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:45):**  it to germinate and grow and make it through and colonize that root system before it runs  
**[1:43:51-1:43:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:51):**  out of the energy that was in that spore that's all the energy it's gotten if they're too  
**[1:43:56-1:44:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:56):**  far away if they germinate and grow they'll die before they get there so they probably  
**[1:44:02-1:44:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:02):**  will never germinate so what I like to do instead if you're going to put a plant in  
**[1:44:08-1:44:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:08):**  that requires mycorrhizal colonization and not all plants need mycorrhizal fungi and  
**[1:44:16-1:44:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:16):**  there are some plants that will be harmed by mycorrhizal colonization so you know we  
**[1:44:23-1:44:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:23):**  you need to know what kind of plant are you planting so where we know that we need the  
**[1:44:30-1:44:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:30):**  mycorrhizal fungi and you suspect you don't have any mycorrhizal fungi in your soil what  
**[1:44:37-1:44:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:37):**  you want to do is take your seeds put them into a compost extract mix in some mycorrhizal  
**[1:44:45-1:44:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:45):**  spores because the mycorrhizal spores stick to organic matter they stick they adhere they're  
**[1:44:52-1:45:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:52):**  there you can't wash them off so you pull your seeds out of that seed drench or maybe  
**[1:45:02-1:45:13](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:02):**  other people what they'd like to do is put the seeds out on a moving belt and just spritz  
**[1:45:13-1:45:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:13):**  those seeds as they go by with that mixture of a compost tea with mycorrhizal spores in  
**[1:45:19-1:45:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:19):**  it the mycorrhizal the tea organisms will stick to the seed surface and so will the  
**[1:45:26-1:45:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:26):**  mycorrhizal spores you let it dry down a little bit and into your planter box it goes and  
**[1:45:33-1:45:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:33):**  you go out and plant and then as soon as that seed germinates and that root starts coming  
**[1:45:40-1:45:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:40):**  out these mycorrhizal spores are right Johnny on the spot starting to form that connection  
**[1:45:48-1:45:56](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:48):**  between the mycorrhizal fungus and the root system so making certain that you have a higher  
**[1:45:56-1:46:02](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:56):**  percentage of success is a really important thing to do when you deal with good money  
**[1:46:02-1:46:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:02):**  on it too right right they those spores are not cheap but understandably so it's not easy  
**[1:46:09-1:46:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:09):**  to grow those root systems get the mycorrhizal fungi to grow on those root systems get them  
**[1:46:17-1:46:24](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:17):**  to make the extramatrical spores and then collect all those extramatrical spores that's  
**[1:46:24-1:46:33](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:24):**  not a cheap job that's not inexpensive so you want to make certain that when you grow  
**[1:46:33-1:46:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:33):**  on things like brassica coal kale crops things like that those are non-mycorrhizal plants  
**[1:46:39-1:46:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:39):**  so don't be inoculating those root systems or those seeds with the mycorrhizal spores  
**[1:46:45-1:46:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:45):**  because you're going to make things worse it's hard for those plants to support their  
**[1:46:51-1:46:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:51):**  own growth requirements as well as the mycorrhizal spore it doesn't do that job of bringing nutrients  
**[1:46:58-1:47:06](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:58):**  to the coal and kale crops is this another justification is this another reason why somebody  
**[1:47:06-1:47:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:06):**  might not want to use a crop rotation you build up a population of mycorrhizal fungi  
**[1:47:12-1:47:17](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:12):**  that associate themselves with a certain crop they're in the soil you plant them season  
**[1:47:17-1:47:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:17):**  after season rotation after rotation and that population of mycorrhizal fungi stays strong  
**[1:47:22-1:47:27](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:22):**  you rotate in another crop that might not form the same association with those same  
**[1:47:27-1:47:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:27):**  mycorrhizal fungi and the ones that you've built up in the soil may go dormant they may  
**[1:47:31-1:47:37](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:31):**  die off so next time your crop comes back into the rotation the fungi that used to be  
**[1:47:37-1:47:41](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:37):**  there and associated with those roots might not be there or there might be less of them  
**[1:47:41-1:47:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:41):**  in the soil so is this a reason to potentially not rotate crops yep yep and so why did you  
**[1:47:50-1:47:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:50):**  do that to yourself have a section of your garden that is for the brassica coal and kale  
**[1:47:57-1:48:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:57):**  crops the mustards and that part yeah you could rotate within that area if you want  
**[1:48:03-1:48:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:03):**  to follow organic regs and and not get dinged and then over here you would have your needs  
**[1:48:10-1:48:19](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:10):**  mycorrhizal colonization so that you're maintaining that soil as close as possible to the perfect  
**[1:48:19-1:48:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:19):**  condition for those crops in terms of colonization of the soil and in terms of colonization of  
**[1:48:26-1:48:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:26):**  the soil what are your thoughts on biochar one thing biochar has a lot of is surface  
**[1:48:31-1:48:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:31):**  area and that provides area for bacteria and other organisms within the soil to colonize  
**[1:48:38-1:48:44](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:38):**  it there's a big push behind biochar there's a lot of advocates of it what are your thoughts  
**[1:48:44-1:48:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:44):**  of it as a soil amendment is it worth it would you use it what are your thoughts i you know  
**[1:48:52-1:48:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:52):**  people will say the same thing about putting clay into compost you need to give the microorganisms  
**[1:48:58-1:49:07](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:58):**  more surface area to grow on and i always like to kind of point out to them that um  
**[1:49:07-1:49:12](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:07):**  there's a lot of organic matter in a compost pile how much surface area does that organic  
**[1:49:12-1:49:20](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:12):**  matter have more than enough there is buku surfaces adding more surfaces that need to  
**[1:49:20-1:49:26](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:20):**  be colonized is that going to is that going to improve things in that compost pile is  
**[1:49:26-1:49:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:26):**  it going to improve things in your soil if you've got now three percent ten percent twenty  
**[1:49:32-1:49:40](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:32):**  fifty percent organic matter in your soil how would adding biochar really make that  
**[1:49:40-1:49:50](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:40):**  much of a difference so i don't buy that one especially if a biochar doesn't have any bio  
**[1:49:50-1:49:57](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:50):**  on the char i don't think that's particularly very worthwhile unless of course you've got  
**[1:49:57-1:50:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:57):**  a problem with a huge compaction if you've got a lot of compaction problems in your soil  
**[1:50:03-1:50:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:03):**  now mixing in biochar that's going to give you fluff that's going to force air space  
**[1:50:09-1:50:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:09):**  in there and so you can see a big effect with biochar if you had compaction problems in  
**[1:50:16-1:50:25](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:16):**  your soil well what if you don't have compaction i i don't see any benefits to adding biochar  
**[1:50:25-1:50:32](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:25):**  if you've already got good structure in your soil you don't need to add air spaces to allow  
**[1:50:32-1:50:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:32):**  oxygen and water and organisms and roots to grow through um what really are the nutrients  
**[1:50:39-1:50:51](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:39):**  that are inside biochar when you start looking at wood chips it's mostly carbon it's got  
**[1:50:51-1:50:55](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:51):**  a little bit of nitrogen a little bit of other nutrients but nowhere near what your plant's  
**[1:50:55-1:51:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:55):**  really going to need so i we've did we did an experiment when i was at rhodale um so  
**[1:51:09-1:51:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:09):**  we looked at where we added a small amount of biochar i can't remember exactly how much  
**[1:51:15-1:51:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:15):**  a little bit higher level of biochar a lot more biochar and then where we did nothing  
**[1:51:23-1:51:30](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:23):**  we didn't add any biochar at all to that soil otherwise the practices were exactly the same  
**[1:51:30-1:51:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:30):**  on everything in that field and as the crop grew and i think it was um soybean it's probably  
**[1:51:39-1:51:47](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:39):**  soybean as the soybean grew there was absolutely no difference in anything they were all the  
**[1:51:47-1:51:53](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:47):**  same height they were all had all had the same nutrient concentration the biology and  
**[1:51:53-1:51:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:53):**  the soil was the same pretty much throughout because it was a soil that was already pretty  
**[1:51:59-1:52:03](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:59):**  good structure because of all of the organic material in there all the organisms i mean  
**[1:52:03-1:52:09](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:03):**  this was rhodale they're one of the original organic farms on the planet so it had good  
**[1:52:09-1:52:16](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:09):**  structure there ain't no difference how much biochar and boy the person who bought that  
**[1:52:16-1:52:23](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:16):**  biochar for that experiment was not happy with us not our fault we did exactly what  
**[1:52:23-1:52:31](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:23):**  the experimental design was so put in biochar when biochar is going to give you a benefit  
**[1:52:31-1:52:38](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:31):**  but if you can't think how that biochar is going to improve things for the organisms  
**[1:52:38-1:52:43](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:38):**  in the soil or for the root system of your plant then it's probably not going to benefit  
**[1:52:43-1:52:48](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:43):**  you at all and so why spend your money do you think the argument for sequestering carbon  
**[1:52:48-1:52:54](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:48):**  in the soil is a good enough argument to justify the use of biochar let's say you're not even  
**[1:52:54-1:52:59](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:54):**  buying it so you take the money out of the equation and you're making it with scrap material  
**[1:52:59-1:53:04](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:59):**  you can sequester carbon in the soil at no cost is that enough of a benefit to justify  
**[1:53:04-1:53:10](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:04):**  using it my attitude of course is always uh why not just take all that really wonderful  
**[1:53:10-1:53:18](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:10):**  wood material and make it into compost it's going to have a much longer effect and it's  
**[1:53:18-1:53:28](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:18):**  going to actually provide food once you take wood and you turn it into charcoal it's really  
**[1:53:28-1:53:39](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:28):**  hard for the microorganisms to use that it's a long-term stable compound but it's not giving  
**[1:53:39-1:53:45](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:39):**  the microorganisms all that much benefit so if it was the only way we could get enough  
**[1:53:45-1:53:52](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:45):**  carbon into the soil would be to bury all that that biochar okay but we have other ways  
**[1:53:52-1:53:58](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:52):**  to stabilize carbon in the soil that makes a lot of sense and i love everything that  
**[1:53:58-1:54:01](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:58):**  you've shared in this interview i want to thank you for taking some time to come on  
**[1:54:01-1:54:08](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:01):**  today and talk all things soil on the podcast so thank you for that in terms of your courses  
**[1:54:08-1:54:15](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:08):**  people can learn more about that at soilfoodweb.com what do you have in store there anything new  
**[1:54:15-1:54:22](https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:15):**  coming up with the courses or the website um we've started the um launch your own lab

### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 19:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:19):**  Humus.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  We all know what that is, right?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  That dark, organic matter found in soil?  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  Well, if you think that, you might be wrong.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  Because it might not actually exist after all.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  In this episode of In Search of Soil, I'm talking to Johannes Lehmann of Cornell.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  And he's done some pioneering research to show that that substance that we affectionately call humus  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  might not actually exist after all.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  In addition to his research on humus and soil carbon, he's also done a lot of pioneering research  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  in the field of biochar.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  So get ready to question everything that you know about soil organic matter  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  in this conversation with Dr. Johannes Lehmann.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:12):**  When it comes to organic matter, it sounds like a very simple subject on general.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  There's leaves and things that have decomposed, they're sitting on soil surface, they get mixed in with the soil.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  How complex can that be?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:26):**  But where do you feel like our understanding is, as humans, in sciences,  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  with how organic matter actually functions within the soil?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  You're absolutely right that this is a subject that has been not only of importance  
**[0:01:47-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:47):**  to us humanity with agriculture and being so close to soil in many respects,  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  but also for research. Looking at what's in the soil and what soil organic matter actually is  
**[0:02:03-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  has been a subject of research inquiry for several hundred years.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  And yet we are still fundamentally revising our understanding of what soil organic matter  
**[0:02:18-0:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  and soil organic carbon actually is composed of, how we can reduce the dangers of losing more of that organic carbon,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:28):**  and how can we restore the historic losses of soil organic carbon.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  And that is really just a very fundamental question of what is in there?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  What is the composition? It's still a very intense research topic.  
**[0:02:49-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  And to a large extent, the reason for that is that it is very complex in terms of chemistry,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  in terms of biology, in terms of just the spatial architecture of the material.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  Just imagine that this is very well known how many organisms are in soil.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:16):**  Soil is the most biodiverse organism. And you can imagine if there are so many organisms in it,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  they are doing a lot of different things and they are producing a lot of different compounds.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  And the ecosystem of these very small organisms is therefore also spatially and temporally very complex.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  And that precluded some of the studies until recently that we didn't even know how many organisms are there.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  Because we can't just with lions and elephants and deer,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  we see them, we can count them, we can distinguish them.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  We see the difference between an elephant and a giraffe,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  but between two microorganisms that we cannot see with the naked eye.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  And even if we see them under the microscope, we cannot necessarily see the difference without DNA analysis.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  It took a while until we can appreciate the enormous biodiversity that rests on the foot.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  And equally, not just they are there, but what are they doing?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  What are they producing? What are they consuming?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:37):**  It is, of course, more difficult if you are dealing with such small organisms  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  and that you typically can't see them because they are in the soil.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  They're not hanging on the tree. They're not above ground where we have more easy access to it.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  But they are in the soil that very often precludes direct observation.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  And if we do direct observation, we dig down, we take a sample, we are already disturbing the ecosystem.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:10):**  And therefore, it is doubly difficult to study soil without disturbing it at the same time.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  So there are some very principal challenges why it takes us so long to understand what we would assume are very basic things about the soil.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  When it comes to soil organic matter, is there one, or maybe there's more than one, big unknown that's a key?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  If we knew the answer to that unknown, it would unlock a lot of other answers and it would help us progress our understanding.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  Is there one thing really holding us back? Is it that complexity?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  Like we just don't know how everything down there interacts in full?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  That could be the case, but without being too flippant about it.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  I would say I'm very cautious of the things that I don't know.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  And so I'm having accompanied and participated in the research over the last 20 years when knowledge that I grew up with as a student has been fundamentally changed.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  I'm cautious in claiming that we already know what we need to know.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:47):**  That doesn't help you, of course. But it's interesting that you mentioned the complexity.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  And while this shouldn't indicate that we have absolutely no clue what's going on,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  the fine points that we are putting on our knowledge are really important.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  Still, some of the causes and effects on a larger scale, many of those we have chronicled rather well.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  Say, for instance, when you till the soil, you're losing carbon.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:28):**  Now, there are some things that we know if you're putting compost on, you're increasing carbon and you're increasing nitrogen availability and crop growth improves.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  So some of these things that we know quite well, it's not that this kind of knowledge all of a sudden goes away.  
**[0:07:45-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  But a lot of important fine points are much less known and we would need to have better knowledge about these very intricate interactions between microorganisms,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  what they eat, what they produce and how they react to environmental change to also predict on a larger scale what's happening if we change our environment.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  For instance, with climate change, what does that mean for soil carbon?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  Because we know that microorganisms are mineralizing, which means making more carbon dioxide when it's getting warmer and when moisture changes into a more favorable environment.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  And these kind of questions, we don't know for the global scale.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  There's still a lot of discussion what happens when the globe warms.  
**[0:08:47-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:47):**  Are microorganisms in soil really accelerating the decomposition of leaves and also organic matter and reacting with a greater carbon dioxide production out of the soil or from the soil?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  Or does that equilibrate at some point? How far does that go?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  That makes a big difference because one of the blatantly obvious facts are that is maybe not well enough known that there is much more,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  several fold more organic carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and the vegetation together on a global scale.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  So small changes, small proportion and changes in the soil and losses of carbon, organic carbon in the soil makes a big difference for atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  So therefore, we have a vested interest in knowing what, for instance, higher temperatures in the atmosphere do to the composition of soil organic matter.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  That point about more carbon being in the soil than in the vegetation atmosphere combined, it's interesting.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  And I want to circle back to that because first I want to talk about one of those changes in your beliefs of you grew up thinking this,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  a lot of people grew up thinking this and it changed along the way and that's humus.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  And I don't want to spoil the end of the story, but if we go back to what you were taught before you know what you know now,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  why was the theory of humus put out there and why did it make sense at the time originally?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:29):**  Yeah, and a lot of that history will probably still need to be written.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  And but the abridged version that I am aware of is that starting with the late 1700s,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  researchers were interested in finding out the world around us.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  And one big part of the world around us is soil and figuring out what organic matter and soil looks like.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  They had to get it out because it was impossible at the time to study the organic matter  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:08):**  and soil without getting it out of away from the minerals and the rocks.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:15):**  And the way to do that, that the first scientists that tried that in earnest figured out you have to do it with a certain extraction.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  They used alkaline solution to do that and that worked beautifully.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  You get a brown soup that comes out of the soil and then they were able to study it in greater detail,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  looked at what atoms are in there, that there's nitrogen in there, that there's carbon in there,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  that there's oxygen in there, all these things that they needed to figure out in the 1700s and 1800s.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  And then researchers found out that when they used different alkali or they precipitated  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  or made less soluble or more soluble these solutions,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  then they could extract different types of organic matter that clearly had different properties.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  And over the 1800s and early 1900s that generated scholarship that tried to explain the behavior of soil organic matter with its extractability  
**[0:12:28-0:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  and led to the classification of these different fractions that one can obtain with words such as humic substances,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  humans, fulvic and humic acids and these kind of useful fractionation and characterization techniques generated in the mid 1900s.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  A scholarship that said there is a process called humification that generates these humic substances.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:04):**  And these humic substances are large and therefore because they are large, they cannot be eaten by microorganisms.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  And therefore we call them recalcitrant.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  That means that they will stay in the soil because they have this material property.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:22):**  And this is what humus is composed of.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  And that is what I learned in university 20, 30 years ago.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  And it turns out once we have the ability to look closer,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:45):**  to actually see what the chemistry of organic matter looks like,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:52):**  what it looks like in situ and soil without extracting it.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  We realized that we were looking at a mixture of materials that are still in a representation of what's in the soil after extraction.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  But it is not a material that is anywhere as this mixture is not found in soil per se.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  So this is similar, I use the analogy with a fruit smoothie very often.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:29):**  Now, if you're blending together a cherry and an orange and a strawberry and a raspberry,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  and you have never drunk or eaten before these fruit and somebody serves it to you,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  then you might be inclined to say that this is a new fruit.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  But in fact, it's a mixture of four fruit.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  And that's fine if you're just interested in its taste.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:56):**  But if you're interested in reproducing it or understanding what the individual components in that fruit smoothie are doing in your gut,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  you need to know that this was a raspberry and a strawberry and a banana or whatever you put in there.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  So it's the same question here. We need when we want to know what is a microorganism actually exposed to when it is in the soil,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  or what is that organic compound in the soil interacting with minerals or in the water when water flows through soil?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:33):**  Then we need to know these individual compounds. We cannot assume that this mixture of this fruit smoothie mixture is the compound in there.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  It is not. It is still a cherry and a banana and orange and a strawberry.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:52):**  And we need to know that there is a strawberry in there and it's not a new fruit that is a mixture of the four.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  And so starting about 20 years ago, scientists have started,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  is significantly to question the existence of this process,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:13):**  humification in the context of making these large recalcitrant humic substances.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  At the same time, we have collectively as a scientific community,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  refined our understanding that, of course, soil organic matter is largely a product of microorganisms.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  It's the residue, broadly speaking, of microorganisms.  
**[0:16:46-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:46):**  But it's not these large molecules that fit neatly into this understanding of humification and humic substance production that we grew up with decades ago.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  So summarizing all that humus, as we previously understood it, or maybe at all, you let me know, just that does not exist, correct?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:16):**  This is what I would say. Yes, it doesn't exist. Humus and humic substances do not exist as we had defined them decades ago.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  The word humus is still, one could argue, very useful in classification.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  There are parts of different soils that are classified as a humus layer.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  And that means just an organic layer on top of the soil.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  So that word is still potentially useful in some nomenclature.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  But in the context of making large recalcitrant humic substances that can be separated and understood  
**[0:18:12-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  in terms of humic acids and fulvic acids in humans, that is not an appropriate approach, in my view, at the present point.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  But it's not an uncontested one. And as with any changes, major changes in scholarship, it's a slow change.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  And probably for good reason. You don't want to throw out all your knowledge and you never should in one swoop.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  But it seems that that is a knowledge shift that has been coming on for several decades now.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  At least two to three, about two to three decades that has taken hold in the last five to 10 years.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  So, and I'm not the expert in this, but my understanding is humus was thought of as microbes eat organic matter.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  That organic matter is then excreted, it aggregates together, and that aggregation is then called humus.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  Is that how they would have explained the formation of humus?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:34):**  Yeah, it's various what's called resynthesis.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  So, as you said, microorganisms eat a leaf and what they produce when eating that leaf are these humic substances.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  And that would be a large condensation product.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  So, aggregation is maybe not the right word, but some kind of synthesis of large molecules that are made while microorganisms are eating a leaf.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  Yes. Although that...  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:19):**  Sorry. So, that doesn't form humus. And there's this other view.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:24):**  It's not the smoothie, it's the component parts. When a microbe eats a leaf, how would you view it now?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  When a microorganism eats a leaf, then that microorganism either produces body mass, not gets fatter,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  makes new microorganisms, sends out enzymes to do business, for instance, eating other materials that it hasn't eaten,  
**[0:20:55-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  making it smaller so it can take it up, like not chopping up a big steak to be able to eat it and put it in its mouth,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  or dies. And then the body, the necromass, or the body of the microorganism would accumulate in the soil.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  Or it just loses parts of the microorganism, such as hair, nail clippings, skin,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  all these things that you lose during your lifetime also goes in the soil.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  But those, we don't need to invoke the production of large humic substances to explain all these input.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  These are still not part of a cell, of a surface, of a microorganism. It is the whole dead microorganism.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  It is the enzyme. And if you sum all that up, you will be able to explain what you find in soil,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:00):**  in addition to half chewed plants and other microorganisms and soil fauna, other biota that are not microorganisms.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  And all of that together is soil organic matter. In aggregate, in some, it is a street that goes from large biomolecules  
**[0:22:24-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  that are leaves and roots towards carbon dioxide. At the end of all of that is carbon dioxide.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  And everything in between is the eye of the needle, the microorganism,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  where all of the leaves and roots will go through on the way to CO2.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  The interesting bit there is, and that is really the frontier at the moment,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:57):**  understanding why these eminently edible plant materials and the even more eminently edible products that microorganisms make,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  they make smaller and smaller compounds that are eminently edible by other microorganisms,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:15):**  why they are retained in the soil much longer than one would assume if this process would happen outside the soil,  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:26):**  let's say in a petri dish or in the laboratory or just in water.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  And that's the reason for that is that there are minerals in there, that the soil architecture exists.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:36):**  And that's when it gets so complex, that this ecosystem is complex,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  that the interactions with increasingly smaller and smaller compounds in the soil with these mineral surfaces,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  adsorption, that something's glued onto something, that there are small cavities, small pores,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:56):**  that something can get lost in, that all of that happens at the same time while the temperature goes up or down.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:05):**  It's getting dry. It's getting wet. It's getting too wet.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:09):**  And you have this enormous biodiversity of organisms on all trophic levels,  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  from large predators that are soil fauna to tiny microorganisms and viruses.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  And all of that is there in high diversity.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  And that is most likely and that's sort of the latest.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:39):**  But I'm sure not the last. The latest step in our knowledge gain that this complexity alone,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  this uncertain landscape where a high diversity of materials are eaten by a high diversity of biota,  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  is in itself a reason why some of this carbon persists and it's not easily eaten,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:04):**  as it would be in a petri dish when you have only one microorganism and glucose, for instance.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  It's an analogy to that. Let's say I had, you know, in my house, I had a million dollars worth of gold dust.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  So I have all this money, like I'm incentivized to go get that gold dust, but it's so fine.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  It's in the carpet. It's behind everything.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:29):**  Like I can't, without tools, pick it up and aggregate it myself.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:34):**  So it just sits there and there's this money all around me.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  In theory, it says it shouldn't be there. I should just go pick it up.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  If it was a stack of bills or stack of gold coins, I could do that.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  But it's distributed so finely that I don't know where it is.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah, so that is a good analogy for one of these aspects of functional complexity, as we've called it.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  So absolutely. It's not just the concentration.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  It's definitely an important part of that. So it's just so finely distributed that it would cost you a lot of time to gather it.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  And it costs you more time than it's worth. Right. You spend one hour to pick up a few dust particles.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:35):**  And it would be easier to do your day job and get money from the bank than pick up these dust particles.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  But then also it's the investment. Maybe you cannot get it at all because some of these dust particles are at a location where you need tweezers.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:59):**  The other dust particles are in locations where you need a vacuum.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:02):**  The third dust particle are in the location where you need a drill.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:06):**  So now you need to buy a drill, a tweezer and a vacuum cleaner.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:11):**  And that just costs more money than you can ever get when you use these tools to obtain the gold dust.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  So it's not worth your while doing that unless you can just buy a vacuum and get the hold of gold dust.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  But that's not how it works. You need different tools to obtain these different parts of these different gold dust particles.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:38):**  So that is a variation on that thinking. But I like that analogy.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  That is a good one. But then you also it's in many when you invoke or think about the soil architecture,  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:55):**  you don't even know that it's there. You don't know that the gold is under the floorboard.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:01):**  So you don't even have the idea to get a screwdriver to unbolt the floorboards to get the gold dust.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  And then the third one is it's raining today and it's very hot tomorrow.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  And maybe your drill only works in cold.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  So also that would you invest in a drill if it's cold at the moment and it wouldn't work?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  So it's this uncertain landscape in a spatially complex environment where you need a lot of tools for a very dilute material that's very diverse.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  That makes it the return on investment for these microorganisms is very often not worthwhile.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  Whereas if if all that gold dust was on a big heap and you would just need to put it into your pocket, it would be a no brainer.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  You would take it. So if we assume this is true, this has been happening for forever.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  And evolution has been happening that whole time. Why hasn't a class of organisms been pulled into that vacuum?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  There's this food source that nobody else is going for. There's a lot of it there.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:20):**  Why hasn't something evolved down or up to get that?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  Hmm. Yeah, not being an evolutionary biologist, I'm on an uneasy footing here.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  Why something has not happened. I know to deal with diversity, to have to have a lot of different tool sets and be optimized for cold, wet, dry, hot.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:56):**  It's just very difficult. And not having tools, but just organismal adaptation at your disposal,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  it is very difficult to do that for any given organism. In aggregate, altogether, all these organisms are good in doing almost everything under any conditions.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  But you need a lot of diversity to accomplish that.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  And that specialization for all these different eventualities makes you not a good generalist.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  Although there's, of course, also very different optimization.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  Some organisms are more on the generalist side and some are more on the specialist side.  
**[0:30:50-0:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:50):**  But it seems that there is no good solution for eating all of that material in the way it is distributed and its diversity in the soil.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:08):**  I know we're talking science. I don't want to get too metaphysical here, but is that nature's way of protecting itself, saying, hey, I'm not going to let you get all the carbon?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  Yeah, so the higher intent of all of that. Yeah, no, that wouldn't be something I could comment on.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  There are many things that one is tempted to look at, the higher meaning in what we observe.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  When for me, it is perfectly fine to say, you know, this is how it evolved and it might be damn luck or just happenstance.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  And that's beautiful also.  
**[0:31:49-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  Sure. Given that it's hidden, it's maybe locked up in the clay, do you have a sense of that level at that particle size over time?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  Is it stable? Is it increasing?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  In other words, if it's not being accessed rapidly, well, those nutrients are forever essentially locked up in that carbon and that carbon's never getting back into the cycle.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  So do you think there's a balance there where there is that small pool of those fine particle sizes and some get eaten and then some are produced  
**[0:32:33-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:33):**  and it levels out over time or is that level just kind of forever increasing, even if that's a slow increase?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  Yeah, no, that's a good question.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  And that's precisely the reason why it is so important.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  I think that we have to look at persistence of organic matter and soil in a different way than we have traditionally.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:02):**  Because when we accept or think in a way that the reason that organic carbon persists in the soil is not because there are recalcitrant materials.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  It's not even that there is organic matter that is forever absorbed or within an aggregate or a small pool.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:25):**  Although, of course, there are some that are turning over much slower than others.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  But it's a constant being eaten, dying.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  It's a constant turnover that happens in soil.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  So we can explain long term and global scale carbon dynamics with relatively fast turnover of soil organic matter,  
**[0:33:57-0:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  which would imply it is not necessary to invoke that a portion of the carbon is never eaten.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:05):**  But we can assume that the carbon is eaten all the time.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  Somebody is eating somebody else all the time.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  And yet, in aggregate, there's still a certain amount of carbon always left over because all of this is happening all the time.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:22):**  Which also means we might not be able to bank on doing something that locks away carbon in soil for the long term.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  Also, that would mean that we have to be careful that we can destroy soils,  
**[0:34:41-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  that we can decrease soil carbon levels with inappropriate management without inputs of organic carbon with a lot of disturbance.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  That maintaining or increasing soil organic carbon levels actually requires constant care.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  It requires appropriate management and then it's resilient.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:07):**  Then you increase or maintain soil carbon levels and can store more carbon.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  But it is not that you do something that would then be in soil,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  a carbon molecule that would be in soil or at a location in soil that would never change.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  It's this constant turnover, this constant change of compounds and organisms that generates itself persistence.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:43):**  So it's kind of an interesting, if you take that a little bit up to another level,  
**[0:35:51-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:51):**  you could think about it as diversity being part of the basis of resilience and sustainability.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  So being very heterogeneous and diverse means you're resilient and persistent.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  Is there a general rule, and I know this gets tricky because there's different soils, different biomes, everything changes,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:19):**  but what percentage of carbon is living in labile versus recalcitrant?  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  If you had to ballpark it and very much generalize, where does that fall?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  Yeah, what we do know, the microorganisms that are living at any given time is about 2 to 5% of total carbon.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  So about 2 to 5% of the carbon in the soil is in a living microorganism.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  And the same applies more or less to nitrogen and phosphorus and so on, some of the nutrients.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:02):**  But many of them don't live very long.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  So that is why a lot of carbon goes through those and is then accumulating in some form or another,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  as I said, either because that microorganism is dying or it's sending out an enzyme or it's doing something else,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  it is adding carbon to soil.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  And that is really, at the moment, the very interesting question,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  generates the very interesting questions.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  What are the pathways of that and how can we understand and quantify that better?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:34):**  And how can we explore that knowledge to make soils more resilient?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  And in the context of climate change, store more carbon without compromising or better with fostering more sustainable soil health systems.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:57):**  So that soils deliver all kinds of ecosystem services for water in addition to climate water, biodiversity and of course, plant production as well.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  And if you look at one agricultural practice that's just known to burn carbon out of a soil, it's tillage or heavy tillage.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  What's happening in the tillage process that is allowing all this carbon to suddenly burn up?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:34):**  So the soil was sitting there, everything was stable, you till, now all of a sudden the soil is releasing all this carbon.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  We know from already talking, it's not that tiny, tiny dust carbon that's going up.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:49):**  So is it just making the bigger chunks of carbon more accessible?  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  Is that what tillage is doing?  
**[0:38:57-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah, the direct effect of the physical impact of tilling on organic carbon, I'm sure that exists as well.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  An important part is to aerate the soil and give oxygen to organisms that have not had optimum oxygen conditions and can therefore start decomposing faster.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  But also to destroy aggregates, aggregation is believed to be an important mechanism of reducing mineralization of organic matter.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  So if aggregates, these are building basic building blocks of the structure of soils,  
**[0:39:58-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  if they are broken open, then a microorganism can all of a sudden access carbon that it couldn't access before.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  And so there are a variety of mechanisms that operate when the soil is tilled.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  And they all work together to allow microorganisms to eat this carbon that would otherwise be less available for the taking.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  So the ultimate mechanism that generates this carbon dioxide are the microorganisms.  
**[0:40:49-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  And tillage is the way to make the carbon that's in the soil better available to the microorganisms in some shape or form.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  And there are no shopping lists of why that is the case.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  If you wanted to increase the carbon stores in soil, would...  
**[0:41:18-0:41:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  Let me back up. The long term carbon storage in soils, is that that tiny, tiny carbon that microorganisms have the trouble finding that we're talking about?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:30):**  Is that where long term carbon storage happens in the soil in that size frame?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  Yes, it's that tiny carbon compound.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  It's not the big piece of a leaf that is still in the soil.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  It's not the big piece of a root that's in the soil.  
**[0:41:49-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:49):**  It's that tiny bit of carbon that in most cases is a residue of a microorganism in some form.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:04):**  And so it's interesting to muse about that the product of a microorganism is also the material that rests, remains the longest in the soil.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  And we typically see that the coarser fractions of half eaten pieces of leaves, those are the ones that are turning over the fastest,  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:34):**  whereas the smallest molecules are turning over the smallest.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  And that makes only sense. If all of that was in solution, it would be most likely the opposite.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:47):**  But since we are working in the soil, a small molecule that has a lot of oxygen and a lot of different forms  
**[0:42:55-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:55):**  that can hide somewhere in a small pore or absorb to iron and aluminum in the soil and clay minerals.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  Those small molecules have a lot of options to not be eaten.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  Whereas a big piece of a leaf, that's a big piece of carbon that is relatively homogeneous at one location.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  So not as a microorganism, you just go to town. You can just specialize on that leaf and then eat it all.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  Or most of it. But then all the compounds that are made out of that, these smaller molecules that are then swimming away and are unique and absorbed to clays and hiding in a small pore.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  Those are then much harder to eat for other microorganisms.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:57):**  So that is definitely the case.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  So then if we wanted to increase that store of carbon as humans, the only way we can get more of that microscopic carbon into the soil is by putting more macroscopic carbon into the soil.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:22):**  So the more we can feed into the top of the funnel, the more by default is going to come out the bottom end of the funnel via microbial action.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:34):**  Yes, that is correct.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  So adding more to the top of the funnel helps. That means putting compost in, growing more plants or removing less plant carbon from the soil.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  That all is a very straightforward way of doing that.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  But also to reduce the loss on the lower end. So if you extend the funnel a little bit lower and say, okay, well, at the very tip of the funnel is where CO2 comes out.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  And we're making that funnel very tight.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  Then we can also retain more carbon in that funnel, in that chute. And that is, for instance, as you mentioned before, reducing tillage.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  Reducing tillage doesn't increase the carbon in. It doesn't put more carbon on top, but it reduces that we lose less carbon at the bottom of the funnel.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:44):**  And so reducing tillage is definitely, or other soil disturbances, is definitely one possibility.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:55):**  Adjusting water contents is another. A very popular topic is to think about wetland restoration in California.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  If we restore wetlands, we will accrue carbon, not because we're putting more carbon into a wetland, but we're losing less carbon through mineralization of that carbon that is in there.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  So moisture is another good way of regulating the losses and so on. So it's both. It's the input on the top end and the output on the bottom end that will regulate how much is in there in the middle.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  And the interactions of those two, that is really where we're still experimenting the most on sort of field and farm scale to understand how we can do that.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:57):**  And again, wetland restoration is just one example where one could imagine to increase water levels and increase the water table to an extent that it reduces the composition of organic matter.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:23):**  And at the same time, not decreasing productivity or maybe increasing plant productivity. So looking at optimization between more input and less output is really interesting.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:39):**  And because these are not linear, it's not that if you increase double the moisture content in the soil, that also means you're halving the mineralization of carbon.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  These are all nonlinear relationships, as is the reaction of plant growth above and below roots and shoots to decreasing or increasing moisture in the soil is also not linear.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:10):**  And since none of this is linear, it's also not always completely predictable what combinations of all of that will generate.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  And so those are very interesting discussion points to think through and experiment and find local solutions because we also know all of this.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  And this is really where we need just so much more information about local conditions because all of that changes with, say, texture or mineralogy or how slopey that land is or how deep the soil is or what your rainfall distribution is.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  And so all of these local conditions will affect all these factors and might even turn the results on its head.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  So we need for optimizing our management, we need all that local information and it goes to such a degree that I think many have now understood that we need this view that is at the moment called digital agriculture or digital agronomy  
**[0:49:34-0:50:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  or such terms that recognize that we need really information for almost every meter of the soil, that the farmer needs that information to optimize management for a certain outcome, whether it's crop yield or soil organic matter accrual or lower leaching and better water quality or whatever the management objectives are.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:02):**  We need information almost meter by meter of a field because it changes so much.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:09):**  And while for many of the individual decisions, we probably have a lot of the information at hand, translating that into field scale recommendation requires all these fine points to be translated into variable management over, let's say, a field.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:29):**  And a lot of farmers are doing that already. They know that side of the field, I need to fertilize less, this side of the field, I need to fertilize more.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  And those kinds of things need to be implemented, are being implemented and farmers are really at the forefront of innovation on these kinds of aspects that are figuring this out.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  And they have known this for forever, that you need this field, you need to know your field and that they need to experiment what works on which kind of field.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:08):**  And translating that into modern tools of management and modern recommendation is really this current step and this current phase that we are in at the moment in soil science and agriculture.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  The big thing now is carbon sequestration, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere, storing it long term in the soil. And with as little as we do know about the soil, I mean, one thing you mentioned is, hey, we don't want to ruin the soil, we could ruin the soil.  
**[0:51:42-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:42):**  And people want to do things like take biochar and let's just stuff stuff into the soil to put carbon down there from just a macro perspective, not getting into biochar specifically, but is there a danger of trying to do too much to sequester carbon into the soil where we we foul things up?  
**[0:52:03-0:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  Or does the soil have the potential to sequester the carbon that we want it to?  
**[0:52:11-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  So, there are several starting points into that conversation. One is, we have already lost quite a lot of organic carbon due to human activities over the last few hundred and thousands of years.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:31):**  By some estimates, it's 130 petagrams or gigatons that we have lost collectively from soils. That is quite a bit of carbon.  
**[0:52:46-0:53:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:46):**  So one could assume that just putting in what we have lost over the last few hundred to last few thousand years shouldn't do any harm because it was there in the first place and we caused it to go away.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:01):**  So say we start adding organic matter back to the soil, bringing it up to levels where it was in the past. Let's say we put organic matter into the soil, compost, manures, biochar, what have you.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  We can also assume that as we add that food source, microbial count populations will expand because they now have more to eat. One thought and one thing I've heard is, well, the more microbes you have in the soil, the more CO2 that's being emitted.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  Is that a linear relationship? If you double the microbial population in the soils, well, there's carbon in that body mass of all those microbes, but they're also emitting CO2.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  Does the lock up in the body mass outweigh the offset of CO2 from their digestion?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  That's a good question. You're putting your finger on a very important research question right there.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:14):**  Because, of course, activity and presence is not the same thing.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  You can have a very large community, but they're not eating a lot. They're just hanging in there. Especially microorganisms are known for, they can be dormant, not too much.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:29):**  But reactivate, some of them more than others, reactivate if conditions are better for them to do what they want to do or need to do to reproduce.  
**[0:54:43-0:55:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  Or there can be very few microorganisms, but they do a lot. To conclude from presence, a lot or very few, to activity, a lot of CO2, less CO2 is not straightforward and in general, not the case.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:05):**  Of course, the highest activity you only get if you have a high amount of live microorganisms, but the opposite is already not true.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  You can have almost no activity with a lot of microorganisms. For instance, an example is in the freezer.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:24):**  If it's very cold, you can have a lot of microorganisms and they do nothing. It depends very much on the conditions.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:39):**  Since we are moving towards the insight that the majority of soil organic matter is actually a remain of a microorganism or the microbial population,  
**[0:55:55-0:56:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:55):**  the ability of the microbial population to build body mass and to assimilate, to eat leaves is the very mechanism by which organic matter is filled up.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:18):**  A current statement that probably most would subscribe is that the majority of soil organic matter is microbial necromass.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  How much a microorganism is producing CO2 versus multiplying or building more body mass and doing other things with the carbon than making CO2 is a big question.  
**[0:56:52-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:52):**  Can we manipulate that? Do we want to manipulate that for making more microbial necromass rather than more CO2? Would that be through more microorganisms or more active microorganisms?  
**[0:57:09-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  Or turning over microorganisms? What is the trick here if there is one? That is a very interesting question to ask and I don't have an answer.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  I don't know if this is in your field of study or not, but that example we talked about, that could have been in a fallow field where exhaust is just going up into the sky.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  But if that is in a planted field, you have now a plant above it. The plant is catching CO2 coming out of the soil.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  It is pulling it from the atmosphere and it is producing using some of that carbon to make its body mass and it is putting a lot of that carbon back into the soil to feed the microbes.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:53):**  In that model there where you have plants, microbes, cycling carbon, I don't know if you know or do you have a sense if science knows, how much carbon leaks out of that chain?  
**[0:58:08-0:58:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:08):**  Meaning the plant doesn't catch that CO2, it is up into the atmosphere to be used at a later day.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:17):**  There is quite a bit of CO2 that goes into the atmosphere.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:24):**  Yes, the CO2 concentrations near the soil surface and especially in the soil are quite a bit higher than above the vegetation.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:38):**  There is a clear gradient of CO2 concentrations from in the soil upwards. That is actually the way landscape scale carbon dioxide emissions are calculated.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  With large towers that measure CO2 at the soil surface and then up to 50 or 100 meters on these towers and that gradient of CO2 with other atmospheric properties are used to calculate how much CO2 is coming up.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:14):**  Of course half the CO2 that comes out of the soil or out of the ecosystem, half of that is from the soil and the other half is from the plants themselves because they respire as well carbon dioxide.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:33):**  They do that at different times of the day, whereas the soils are doing it practically day and night.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:45):**  Granted with some differences that it's usually different temperatures at night than during the day.  
**[0:59:53-1:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:53):**  But for plants, of course, there's a big difference because during sun hours they're doing different metabolism photosynthesis than during the night.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  That changes the CO2 exchange quite dramatically.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  There's a lot going on in terms of who is producing carbon dioxide and who is taking it up.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  But the plants are only taking it up during the day when they're doing photosynthesis and the soils are also producing it during the night because they don't care whether it's day or night.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:29):**  So as humans we're trying to reduce our carbon impact. We are trying to sequester it.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:36):**  One of the tools that has been talked about a lot over the past 20 years to do that has been Biochar.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:44):**  I know you were somebody who started looking at this very early on.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:48):**  You might even be the guy who made it most popular back in the 90s when you started talking about it.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  We'll get into a lot of the details about Biochar, but if you summarize what you know today,  
**[1:01:01-1:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:01):**  how do you view Biochar as a tool for if we just isolate it to sequestering carbon, like ignore agricultural benefit,  
**[1:01:11-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:11):**  sequestering carbon, how beneficial is Biochar as a tool?  
**[1:01:19-1:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  It occupies a very intriguing and interesting niche because of the way it can recycle plant residues and waste residues that might be difficult to utilize otherwise.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:40):**  As well as because of the unique properties of this Biochar material when added to soil that it can generate knock-on effects that are mitigating climate change as well.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:56):**  That would not be generated when we would just bury the CO2, for instance, directly or do other things with organic matter.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:07):**  We do have to keep in mind that whatever we do, however intensive we mitigate climate change using Biochar technology,  
**[1:02:27-1:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:27):**  that alone will not avert dangerous climate change unless we're also reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel production and other emissions dramatically.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:41):**  We're doing other things as well to withdraw CO2 from the atmosphere.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:48):**  That's the inconvenient truth for any topic that we might talk about.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  There's not one thing that will fix it, neither on reducing greenhouse gas emissions nor on withdrawing CO2 from the atmosphere.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:05):**  By now, we know that we have to do both.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:10):**  The question is when do we get started in earnest on the whole portfolio of what we can do because we need all the tools in our tool baskets to let loose on this problem.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:24):**  That said, I do think that Biochar, as I said, has a role to play.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:34):**  The question is whether there is any better tool that competes with it on some level.  
**[1:03:44-1:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:44):**  I could see if there's no crop residue or agricultural residue or all the biomass that we grow on land is utilized for something else, then maybe we don't need to do Biochar.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:03):**  At the moment, that is not what's on the horizon.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:07):**  All major calculations add Biochar to the portfolio of options simply because that makes the most sense.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:22):**  But the decisions, there's always questions about where shall we allocate our resources, both in terms of research, but also in terms of development and policy incentives, but also in plain carbon.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  We've talked about this just now that we want to maximize organic matter additions to soil to build soil organic matter.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:49):**  If we take some of that residue, some of those leaves and wood and make Biochar from it, we will add less to the soil.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:59):**  Yes, we're making a material Biochar, and that's sort of the backbone of why Biochar is a climate mitigation tool,  
**[1:05:09-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:09):**  because that Biochar is one to two orders of magnitude more persistent in soil than if we had added the leaves or the wood to the soil without charring it.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  So a lot of the functions that a leaf added to soil is delivered also by that charred leaf added to soil with the benefit that that charred leaves remains in soil one to two orders of magnitudes longer than the uncharred leaf would have had.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:42):**  And there are other benefits that that charred leaf has actually a better ability to retain nutrients, for instance, than the uncharred leaf.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:56):**  And all of that adds to a very interesting argument for charring those residues that we can, because they are already posing an environmental burden,  
**[1:06:13-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  and substitute a shorter lived leaf residue with a longer lived char residue.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  And so the current calculations indicate that if we were to adopt Biochar on a global scale massively, then we would not get beyond about 10-20% of current fossil fuel emissions.  
**[1:06:50-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  And that is sort of in the order of magnitude of any other technology that you can think about as well, maybe with the exception of very ambitious direct air capture and BECCS and other technologies that might potentially reach greater carbon withdrawal amounts,  
**[1:07:15-1:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  but are much further in the future and much costlier and frankly don't have any downstream benefits.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:23):**  And that's where I would put sort of a counterpoint to your framing question and said, let's talk about climate and not about the other benefits.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  Because I feel that there's a really interesting societal and eventually geopolitical discussion to be had.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:43):**  We have a finite amount of plants and photosynthesis on this planet.  
**[1:07:49-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:49):**  What do we want to do with that?  
**[1:07:51-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  Do we want to make as much CO2 and energy out of it and inject that CO2 somewhere?  
**[1:07:58-1:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:58):**  Or do we want to feed our soils and restore soil organic matter with that?  
**[1:08:08-1:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:08):**  And I think that's sort of also a societal discussion.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:14):**  Where does our plant carbon generate the greatest societal environmental value?  
**[1:08:25-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:25):**  And I would say we shouldn't forget soils in that equation.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  It's not just energy, it's not just feeding us or clothing us or mitigating climate change.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:41):**  It's also our environment in terms of soil carbon that will have many different other benefits.  
**[1:08:51-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:51):**  At least to restore soil carbon levels to pre-industrial levels would make a lot of sense.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  I think that's well said and why I framed it the way I did is because based on a lot of the reading I've done, people I've talked to on the show,  
**[1:09:11-1:09:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:11):**  I question the benefits of biochar as a whole.  
**[1:09:15-1:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:15):**  And I'll pose this question to you this way and you can give your opinion on it.  
**[1:09:20-1:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:20):**  If I had three buckets sitting in front of me and one bucket are knowns, if we apply biochar, we know these things are going to happen.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:29):**  Then in the middle bucket, we have we think, but we're not sure.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:34):**  And then in the farthest bucket, the third bucket, it's claims that are unsubstantiated.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:41):**  And from talking to people in the past, it sounds like, OK, one biochar, I use it.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:45):**  I'm going to sequester carbon longer than easier to break down carbon.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:50):**  That's in the known. That's going to happen. It's going to increase tilth.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  Like you're at it, you're aerating the soil, you're adding that into the soil.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:59):**  There's some water holding capacity increase by putting it in versus not putting it in.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:05):**  Then I think you get into plant growth benefits. Does it help?  
**[1:10:10-1:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:10):**  I think that's the middle bucket. And then you get into very outlandish claims like it can really turn soil around in the other bucket where people take the terra preta to the extreme and say, OK, well, we can apply this anywhere.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:26):**  And now we have the most fertile soil in the world.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  Where do you think when you look at these buckets in the realm of what's possible and known with biochar beyond sequestering carbon, what are some things we can hang our hat on today to justify use?  
**[1:10:43-1:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:43):**  Because a lot of I think people in agriculture would love to use it, but they're trying to say, OK, it's that cost analysis we talked about earlier with the drill and the tweezers in the vacuum.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:55):**  Is it worth me spending time or money to add this to my fields because I'm in a production scenario?  
**[1:11:03-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:03):**  I need to see a return on investment beyond just feel good of sequestering carbon.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  Yeah, no, that's a very good question. And in many ways, it's not different to many other questions that a land user, whether it's a municipality, a landscaper or a farmer or homeowner has.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:26):**  I have this shelf of options. And which one shall I pick first? And how many shall I pick after I pick that first one?  
**[1:11:39-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:39):**  And what do I want to do with it? And those questions and the answers to those questions are just very different depending on where you are, what you want to do, how much money you have, etc., etc.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  And so it's really hard to say who should be engaging and who should not.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:09):**  When adopting a new technology, a new way of managing soils, there's always risk involved.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:21):**  And that was the same with fertilizers and remains today. Nobody would dispute that adding nutrients in some shape or form is necessary because we know that we export nutrients with harvests and we're losing nutrients in other ways, even if in addition to the ones that we're exporting with harvests.  
**[1:12:50-1:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  And we need to replenish them. And so those kinds of insights are, we have accepted them and we are reacting to them in a way that we are adding nutrients in, whether it's inorganic or organic.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:10):**  And then still a lot of questions remain. Which ones do you use? Do you do organic or do you do inorganic? When do you apply? How much do you apply? How do you apply? Do you do no tillage or not?  
**[1:13:26-1:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:26):**  And you need to try it out. And you need to learn from your neighbor that has hopefully similar soils. And then you can try it out with similar techniques and see whether it works for you. And yet, there's still a huge range of responses that land users will see.  
**[1:13:46-1:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:46):**  And of course, since there is in most cases, no neighbor to ask, and with that particular biochar that maybe is available in your area or that you can make on your own farm, there is nobody who can tell you that somebody else has already an experience with it.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:08):**  And the extension officer has never heard anyone doing it and has also no experience with it. Then you're driving a little bit blind. And that will be the case until information has accelerated.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:24):**  So how do you get this acceleration of information that farmers or land users can make informed decisions that generate value to them financially but also environmentally and for society as a whole?  
**[1:14:42-1:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:42):**  That is really a good question. And it will take time. That is maybe something where the notion of that nutrients are needed for plants and that we need to put nutrients in some shape into the soil was developed in the first half of the 19th century.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:07):**  And yet, full scale fertilizer use only started after World War Two. So I'm hoping that it doesn't take another hundred years until we have the knowledge together to have a refined extension service and companies and industry who can give recommendations on management.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:36):**  And without belaboring COVID too much, we've seen that we can accelerate development of technology and information rapidly if need be.  
**[1:15:50-1:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:50):**  We might need to think about COVID response types to climate change to accelerate our knowledge base and not just leave it to individual farmers to experiment and fail and experiment and fail and experiment and half succeed over the next 10, 20 years to arrive at recommendations that maybe with more concerted action,  
**[1:16:18-1:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:18):**  we could have had in five years. But I do see the problem and for any given farmer who is interested in contemplating biochar, you need to be aware that it's probably not plug and play.  
**[1:16:41-1:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:41):**  And it's not even clear if, as a blanket, I don't know the specific situation of a specific farmer and can't comment on that now, but that the likelihood that you're having greater crop yields soon, you can't bank on that.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:04):**  But it might be. And maybe you don't find that the optimum way of cropping with biochar very easily. And maybe there is no crop yield benefit at your location with your crops, with your biochar that you can purchase, or it's simply too expensive.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:25):**  And that is then of course now where we're getting ultimately if it's of societal value that we want to restore carbon in soils and withdraw CO2 from the atmosphere.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:38):**  And we want to subsidize farmers to get the financial freedom and the opportunity to experiment with biochar, whether it has knock on effects for their bottom line, which is typically growing a crop, whether it's an animal or a plant crop.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:59):**  Then maybe this is a mechanism to doing so and put safeguards on it. This is a method where we can be absolutely certain that carbon in soil increases and CO2 in the atmosphere decreases.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:18):**  And we're paying for you to experiment with that risk financially, risk free and maybe it does something good for you, then you might want to continue doing it or maybe not.  
**[1:18:32-1:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:32):**  Then no harm done for you. But we thank you very much that there's less CO2 in the atmosphere. And so those are opportunities.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:43):**  Let me pause you there for a sec. So you're empowering farmers to do that with that statement. And I love that, you know, let's go try some stuff.  
**[1:18:52-1:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:52):**  Based on your research, what you've seen, if we did go back to crop yield effects or crop growth effects, it doesn't have to be yield, it could just be healthier crops, more able to withstand drought, that type of things.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:07):**  Do you think it's maybe possible, possible or reasonably possible that positive results would be seen in terms of plant health and plant growth?  
**[1:19:21-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:21):**  Where do you think we are based on all the information you've seen in terms of plant growth expectations?  
**[1:19:29-1:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  Yeah. So if you're taking a random biochar off the shelf somewhere and you have no prior information and you stick it into a random soil and you grow a random crop and you do this everywhere in the world,  
**[1:19:45-1:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:45):**  then at the moment the data show that the average crop yield increase is about 20%, 15 to 20%. But the range is large. For some, in some situations with some.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:00):**  So if you're putting, for instance, a biochar that has a pH of nine, so a highly alkaline biochar onto a highly alkaline soil, the chances that you don't see a crop yield increase or even a crop yield decrease is pretty high.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:16):**  So we already know a few things that don't really work very well. But if you're putting an alkaline biochar on an acid soil, the chances that your crop yields increase is pretty high.  
**[1:20:29-1:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:29):**  But on average, that's where we're sort of in the 15 to 20% crop yield increase for the whole globe if you take random biochars on random soils.  
**[1:20:39-1:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:39):**  Now, some of the crop yield increases reported in the literature are very, very high. Now, the trick is to not do an average crop yield increase because you can do the same analogy with nitrogen fertilizer or irrigation also.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:55):**  If you were to irrigate all the crop land in the world and put nitrogen on all of the crop land on the world, the average response would also not be very good.  
**[1:21:07-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:07):**  Because some soils don't like more water and some soils and some crops don't need nitrogen. So if we do the same with something that we all accept, such as nitrogen addition in some form is probably needed for crop growth and water is also needed for crop growth.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  If we have no water and no nitrogen, there's no plant growth. But if we do a random sprinkler of nitrogen and water across the earth surface, cropping surface, the agricultural agronomic response would also be probably rather meager.  
**[1:21:51-1:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:51):**  So we need more knowledge. We need that knowledge to know this soil with this biochar, we already know there is a good response.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:03):**  There is enough information to provide some guidance, but not enough to roll out large programs on a national or global scale. But for some farmers, there might already be some information.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:24):**  Now, the problem is the farmer can probably not access it or translate it into a useful farming recommendation.  
**[1:22:34-1:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:34):**  It is buried in scientific papers and ifs and buts of a scientific discourse. And so translating what we already know into useful farmer recommendation and work on improving farmer recommendation where it has the greatest benefit for the farming community  
**[1:23:03-1:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:03):**  is the task ahead. And that's still a task to be done. So a farmer or a land user or a homeowner who does it by herself now, you're an explorer and you need to realize that.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:24):**  One of the things that I know you've looked at and research at Cornell, making biochar out of other ways like cherry pits, vineyard prunings, things like that.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:34):**  I love the idea of that because that stuff's hard to deal with otherwise. Walnut hulls, macadamia nut shells, all those things.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:42):**  There's not a lot of other uses for them. And then I also know that you guys, I mean, very recently, I think yesterday, you did a presentation on using dairy manure to make biochar.  
**[1:23:54-1:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:54):**  When you look at that type of biochar feedstock, a manure that could be composted or added to the soil straight, how would you advise somebody to think about, I have this pile of dairy manure here.  
**[1:24:13-1:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:13):**  I should make biochar out of it or I should compost it and put that on my soil.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:19):**  Yeah, that's a very good and important discussion.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:26):**  And the important is again to ask the question, what do you try to fix?  
**[1:24:37-1:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:37):**  And if you have a nitrogen problem or you're substituting nitrogen fertilizer in your soil, then taking a high nitrogen containing feedstock such as dairy manure or other manures and pyrolyzing them is probably not the way you want to do that.  
**[1:24:59-1:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:59):**  Because you're driving off half of the nitrogen as much as the carbon and the other half of the nitrogen is transformed into the same kind of persistent organic structure that also the carbon is in.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:13):**  And essentially you're withdrawing nitrogen from the equation. However, in that scenario, two things could potentially sway your mind.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:24):**  One is you have a contamination issue. So maybe it's not dairy manure, but you're talking about human feces that are contaminated with hormones and antibiotics and pathogens.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:40):**  Then maybe you are swayed to say, okay, I accept that I lose my nitrogen, but I'm making something that's actually an environmental burden because it would destroy my water reserves.  
**[1:25:54-1:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:54):**  And I'm not allowed to put it on the soil to begin with. I'm putting my human feces and pyrolyzed cells.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:03):**  The other one is that, let's say you have dairy manure and it's benign. You can compost it. It is healthy and clean and afterwards, and you have the space to do that and the time to do that.  
**[1:26:20-1:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:20):**  That's another. Composting takes several weeks to several months and needs a lot of footprint. That might not always be there. Whereas pyrolysis, you can pyrolyze within minutes.  
**[1:26:35-1:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:35):**  And therefore the throughput is a lot faster. But say you have all that at your disposal.  
**[1:26:43-1:26:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:43):**  Then the question is, what are your transportation distances? Is that material then used on your farm?  
**[1:26:51-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:51):**  Then probably this is the best way of doing that. Or is that material that needs to be transported 100 miles or 200 miles across the world?  
**[1:27:05-1:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  Then I would say it's probably not a good idea to ship 80% or 70% water across the landscape.  
**[1:27:16-1:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:16):**  Because we know that, for instance, dairy lagoon manure, the nutrient values in that can only be shipped about 10 to 20 miles until the nutrient value is lower than the transportation costs.  
**[1:27:33-1:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:33):**  That's, of course, different for compost. But you cannot ship liquid dairy manure very far to not have the transportation costs exceed the nutrient values.  
**[1:27:49-1:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:49):**  So that is in there as well. The third aspect is, let's assume you are the consumer of your compost and you're in California and you are on an organic farm.  
**[1:28:05-1:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:05):**  You're making as much compost as is needed for your organic irrigated farm to keep organic matter levels up so that you only need the minimum water content for your irrigation.  
**[1:28:23-1:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:23):**  But that probably means that you are adding quite a bit of compost because the compost is mineralizing very, very fast.  
**[1:28:35-1:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:35):**  You're probably over applying nitrogen and phosphorus and everything just to keep organic matter levels up so that your irrigation is optimized.  
**[1:28:49-1:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:49):**  Maybe you don't need as much compost on your soil just to add for the nutrient the nitrogen needs.  
**[1:28:58-1:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:58):**  So what about adding, making as much compost to satisfy your nitrogen needs, but paralyzing the rest of your manure to satisfy your carbon needs to optimize irrigation?  
**[1:29:12-1:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:12):**  So here are three examples where in certain cases, for different reasons, you might be swayed actually to contemplate making biochar out of your nitrogen rich feces, at least partially, instead of composting them.  
**[1:29:32-1:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:32):**  So the decision criteria are always different and need to take these local conditions in mind.  
**[1:29:39-1:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:39):**  Yeah, I think those are great ways for people to think about it. I mean, it's just it's almost like a flow chart, right?  
**[1:29:45-1:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:45):**  Yeah.  
**[1:29:46-1:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:46):**  Go down that. But one thing that's came up a lot is lately I've talked to people about horse manure and a lot of other manures you're finding amino pyrrolid persistent herbicide contamination in those manures.  
**[1:30:00-1:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:00):**  It's got a long half-life, composting doesn't break it down.  
**[1:30:05-1:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:05):**  So composting isn't an option. Do you know if you pyrolyzed a tainted manure that had persistent herbicide present, will that herbicide break down in the pyrolysis process so the biochar that comes out the back end won't have that negative effect of the chemical in it?  
**[1:30:29-1:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:29):**  A very clear yes. If it is an organic compound, if we're talking about copper and cadmium and heavy metal or arsenic, then the discussion is more nuanced.  
**[1:30:45-1:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:45):**  Because of cadmium in this cadmium out, we could then talk about the form of cadmium or the form of arsenic.  
**[1:30:53-1:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:53):**  But if we're talking about glyphosate or any organic compounds, they are all denatured.  
**[1:31:02-1:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:02):**  They're another carbon compound and of no concern.  
**[1:31:08-1:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08):**  And the same applies to pathogens as well.  
**[1:31:11-1:31:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:11):**  And pharmaceuticals as well?  
**[1:31:14-1:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:14):**  Yes, although I'm not... If they are organic, if the functional and the problematic active compounds and groups in these chemicals are of organic nature.  
**[1:31:28-1:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:28):**  Again, no cadmium or any heavy metals are still heavy metals.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:35):**  If I think about your example before of, hey, maybe you're over adding compost, you just want that water holding capacity of organic matter.  
**[1:31:44-1:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:44):**  You pyrolyze some, you compost some.  
**[1:31:47-1:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:47):**  Do you know I have two equal containers, one's full of just let's say dairy manure, one's full of pyrolyzed dairy manure and they're in the same volume.  
**[1:32:00-1:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:00):**  Is the water holding capacity of both those approximately equal?  
**[1:32:09-1:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:09):**  I don't know.  
**[1:32:11-1:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:11):**  That is and there are a couple of caveats. One is the water holding capacity of that material is probably less relevant than the water holding capacity of that material mixed with wherever you're growing your crop.  
**[1:32:30-1:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:30):**  And that will change.  
**[1:32:32-1:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:32):**  And there's an interaction.  
**[1:32:33-1:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:33):**  And we know that already.  
**[1:32:35-1:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:35):**  So adding a certain biochar or other organic matter, but we know if we stick with biochar, adding a certain biochar to a sandy soil might increase water holding capacity, whereas adding it to a clay soil might decrease water holding capacity.  
**[1:32:54-1:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:54):**  So there is an interaction between the two.  
**[1:32:58-1:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:58):**  And, and, and so it's, it will never be a clear answer.  
**[1:33:05-1:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:05):**  In general,  
**[1:33:11-1:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:11):**  the porosity and micro porosity of charred material is typically higher than the micro porosity of uncharred material. Some of it is not very much higher.  
**[1:33:30-1:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:30):**  So if you're charring poultry manure, the pore space, it doesn't increase as much as if you were charring wood.  
**[1:33:43-1:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:43):**  With woody material especially and the very fine pores have a proportionally larger contribution to that.  
**[1:33:51-1:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:51):**  The porosity increases dramatically, you know, several orders of magnitudes and that's why we're doing it because we're interested in what's then marketed as activated carbon, because it is, it is so has so many pores and it's so highly porous.  
**[1:34:08-1:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:08):**  So in general porosity increases, but for different materials that we would char to different extents, and also the size of the pores differs that are created, and then the interaction with whatever soil you're adding it to complicates it as well.  
**[1:34:28-1:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:28):**  So that is something to think through.  
**[1:34:32-1:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:32):**  In general, sandy soils benefit the most from organic matter additions in terms of water holding capacity and that's also the case for biochars.  
**[1:34:46-1:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:46):**  They will also benefit sandy soils, the most typically in terms of water and cold capacity and sandy soils are also the ones where organic matter mineralizes the fastest.  
**[1:35:02-1:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:02):**  So there you have a very clear storyline where you could argue that in sandy soils if water holding capacity is a problem and you can afford biochar that's another problem, the costs of it.  
**[1:35:17-1:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:17):**  Then, then, probably in most cases biochar will will increase water holding capacity for longer period of time than the uncharred organic matter would have done.  
**[1:35:33-1:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:33):**  That, no.  
**[1:35:36-1:35:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:36):**  We haven't divided that but by dollars in this kind of statement and that's where very often it falls apart now because it might be the cost of adoption at the moment, especially if technology if you're the first one to purchase, or if you're buying biochar  
**[1:35:58-1:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:58):**  that is very often prohibitive for most people.  
**[1:36:04-1:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:04):**  But it's a work in progress and I sometimes use also here that the analogy of photovoltaics and wind.  
**[1:36:14-1:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:14):**  The first wind energy, big scale wind energy plants have been built in the 50s and photovoltaics was well on the horizon and developed in the 70s and yet it took another 50 to 60, 70 years until many houses have photovoltaics on their roof.  
**[1:36:37-1:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:37):**  It's just, it takes a while to adopt it and for various reasons, the technology, the information, the penetration, the society, the acceptance, legislation and incentive structures, all of that has to come together.  
**[1:36:53-1:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:53):**  Until then it's a rocky road and that's where we are at at the moment.  
**[1:36:59-1:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:59):**  You know one thing you talk about when you apply organic matter to the soil, say compost, it mineralizes very quickly, but we know in that mineralization process we're left with that, not the humus, but that small fine portion of carbon left in the soil.  
**[1:37:16-1:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:16):**  How significant is that microscopic portion left or does it only become significant in terms of water holding capacity and its value in the soil as carbon after many, many, many, many applications over many, many, many years?  
**[1:37:34-1:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:34):**  That's a good question. That's a thought provoking question.  
**[1:37:41-1:37:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:41):**  In general, the distribution, or if I translate that into the word particle size, how clumpy or how big are the particles of organic matter makes a difference.  
**[1:37:56-1:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:56):**  So to have the same material in little beads, even if everything else is the same, it's the same solubility, the same composition and in one case it's concentrated somewhere and the other case it's distributed finally in the soil that we know now and we start to know that much better now makes a big difference.  
**[1:38:20-1:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:20):**  We weren't able to ask these kinds of questions years or decades ago. So these are really new questions. Is the spatial distribution on the scale of a microorganism, that it's relevant for microorganism, does that matter or not? And the answer is yes.  
**[1:38:37-1:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:37):**  In what way and how can we exploit that? That I would really like to know.  
**[1:38:43-1:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:43):**  One thing I was reading in a Medium article that had a quote from you is, it was talking about microbial and abiotic nitrogen cycles and you were saying we're on to a really interesting story here.  
**[1:38:55-1:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:55):**  I think we'll be able to change some very long held beliefs about how nitrogen ends up in the soil and how it moves from the soil into the plant. There'll be a lot of new knowledge created in the next few years.  
**[1:39:06-1:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:06):**  And we wanted to contribute to that.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:11):**  What's that about?  
**[1:39:14-1:39:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:14):**  Yeah, that's, I'm getting very excited about this, but I don't have a lot more to say than that because we're making slow progress in this area, but we're very interested in exploring ammonia gas dynamics in soil.  
**[1:39:41-1:40:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:41):**  The formula is NH3, and it's a gas, not to be confused with ammonium, which is the salt and some people use the words interchangeably. So, ammonia is a gas. It's the one that you smell in dairy manure, and it's a noxious smell.  
**[1:40:04-1:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:04):**  It's also very often a fertilizer in the US, used very often as a fertilizer.  
**[1:40:12-1:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:12):**  And we know that there is quite a bit of ammonia gas emitted from soils.  
**[1:40:21-1:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:21):**  It's not very well quantified. We think that the transport of this ammonia gas within the soil from its production during decomposition of leaves, there seemed to be quite a bit of ammonia gas produced, and then it can move much quicker than water could through the soil and also in all directions.  
**[1:40:49-1:40:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:49):**  Water doesn't move so much upwards, especially in more humid climates, but gases do.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:56):**  And therefore, might be a much more important delivery mechanism of nitrogen than any other nitrogen form in soil to the plant.  
**[1:41:06-1:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:06):**  So, we have looked at that and thought that this might be really important to understand nitrogen delivery from its production, from nitrogen mineralization to plant uptake.  
**[1:41:22-1:41:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:22):**  And would really like to know more about the interactions of this ammonia gas and plants, but also the interaction of ammonia gas and soil organic matter.  
**[1:41:37-1:42:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:37):**  And that is another very important interaction that we've found evidence that the ammonia gas reacts very quickly and profoundly with organic carbon molecules in soil to produce organic nitrogen compounds that we have typically explained with microbial immobilization of nitrogen.  
**[1:42:02-1:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:02):**  So both the interaction of nitrogen with soil organic matter, as well as the interaction of nitrogen with plants uptake.  
**[1:42:13-1:42:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:13):**  I think there will be interesting fine points on that. Farmers have used anhydrous ammonia for a while and especially the US.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:22):**  A lot of farmers use that. And I think it although it's sort of implicit that there might be important movement of ammonia gas in soil when you apply anhydrous ammonia.  
**[1:42:37-1:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:37):**  Quantification of that and understanding the plant uptake is very scant.  
**[1:42:44-1:43:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:44):**  So I'm very interested in thinking through that more and do believe that that's a very important research item that will be important both for improving nitrogen fertilization, reducing emissions and reducing aquatic contamination.  
**[1:43:06-1:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:06):**  So I think that will be very important. And since nitrogen is the number one energy factor in agriculture of our agriculture products, it is a very important question.  
**[1:43:24-1:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:24):**  How can we get nitrogen use efficiency up in agriculture?  
**[1:43:30-1:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:30):**  It's really interesting stuff and all that's related to the application of nitrogen. So that ammonia gas is from nitrogen application.  
**[1:43:39-1:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:39):**  It's not being produced in the soil as a result of soil ecosystem.  
**[1:43:44-1:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:44):**  Both. We're using fertilizers that are anhydrous ammonia already. We're using fertilizers that the ammonia can be transformed in high pH soils into gas and the natural mineralization, the natural decomposition of organic matter also produces ammonia.  
**[1:44:09-1:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:09):**  So ammonia is produced in various different ways through management and just naturally.  
**[1:44:17-1:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:17):**  But we haven't paid much attention to it for very good reason, because it is very difficult to analyze.  
**[1:44:22-1:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:22):**  It sticks to a lot of things. It reacts quickly. So even quantifying how much there is, is more difficult than, say, for carbon dioxide or other gases.  
**[1:44:36-1:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:36):**  So it's a little bit more challenging to work with. But I think it's an exciting research direction.  
**[1:44:43-1:44:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:43):**  Really cool stuff. And for people that want to follow along with this future research, for farmers that want to learn more about biochar,  
**[1:44:51-1:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:51):**  where's a good source that you can send them to stay up to date with all this work and something that's going to give them a realistic view on things, not just all hype?  
**[1:45:02-1:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:02):**  Yeah, I have been active in the International Biochar Initiative for a long time and would still say that and recommend farmers to check out the website of the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[1:45:23-1:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:23):**  But of course, as with every initiative, this is an umbrella organization that's a network of individuals from all sectors, whether it's producers, farmers, researchers, policymakers, industry.  
**[1:45:38-1:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:38):**  And so you see, as with everywhere on the web, you see all kinds of voices and you have to make up your mind. There is no authoritative voice other than the panoply of opinions and information.  
**[1:45:57-1:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:57):**  So I do agree that we need to distill this down and hopefully we see some good extension type textbooks come out in the next few years that will be able to be used by farmers and users of biochar.  
**[1:46:57-1:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-12-JohannesLehmann-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:57):**  Thank you.

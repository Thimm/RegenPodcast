### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Today we're talking trichoderma.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  If that name doesn't ring a bell, if you don't recognize what trichoderma is, maybe you'd  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  recognize it by its commercial product name.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:31):**  Root Shield and Root Shield Plus.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  Many of you as growers may have used that product before and the primary ingredient  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  in that product is trichoderma.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  And today we're talking all about that beneficial fungus with someone who spent their life researching  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  it.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  Dr. Gary Harmon of Cornell.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  Today he's going to be talking all about the benefits of trichoderma in both natural and  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  agricultural soils.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  And I think by the end of this one, you're going to be saying, I want trichoderma in  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  my soil.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  Let's get into it with Dr. Gary Harmon.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  I want to thank you for taking the time to chat here today.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  Let's start at the very beginning.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  Trichoderma, what is it?  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  Trichoderma is a fungus.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:21):**  It's a green fungus.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  My wife makes a joke that I made a career out of what everybody else wrote down at the  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  back of the refrigerator.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  And I started working on trichoderma back in 1980, so it's been a long time.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  And for people, they hear it's a fungus and they see it and I think they think it's a  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  mold.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  So mold versus...  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  It is a mold.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:47):**  The fungus and the mold are the same thing.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  So like in a basic definition level, fungus and mold, same thing?  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  Same thing.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  Okay.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:56):**  So if it wasn't commercialized and looked at for agricultural uses into the 90s, let's  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  go back in time a little bit before that to the beginning of your career.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  Started looking at this in the 1980s, but it wasn't for 10 to 15 years later that it  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:12):**  became a product.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  Can you talk about your early days in that initial discovery?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  What brought that interest in this specific fungi?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:22):**  Started at Colorado State with Edlin, Schott and Tex Baker and went to a meeting and they  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  were talking about protoplasm fusion.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  If you want to develop a new variety of plant, you use sexual hybridization.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  But for a fungus, they don't have...  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:43):**  These are the strains we use, have no known sexual strain.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  So there is a process whereby you can dissolve away the cell walls and fuse them.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  And then it became a very interesting exercise.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  There were huge diversity introduced that way.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  And we went through, I don't know, thousands of strains and we finally selected T22 because,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  and this is a really important concept, it's rhizosphere-competent, which means it can  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  grow on the roots.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  And not only can it grow on the roots, it grows in the roots, we found out later.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  And in the roots, then it persists and grows with the plant and lasts for the life of at  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  least an annual crop and on perennial crops like turf it lasts longer than that.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  And it induces the plant then to reprogram itself genetically, which means that there  
**[0:04:01-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  are a lot of genes that are upregulated and proteins that are upregulated to...  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  And then the effects become systemic throughout the plant.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  So even though they're on the roots, they can control things like powdery mildew on  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:21):**  the foliage.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  And we also then have found that they can induce through this mediation through the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  plant, they can induce increased photosynthesis, increased bile stress, and bile stresses,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:45):**  diseases and pests.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  With these strains being isolated and then being used in agriculture, if you go out into  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  the wild and just soils in general, are you going to find trichoderma?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  Most common fungus in soil is probably trichoderma.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:02):**  But the really useful attributes are restricted on a strain basis.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:13):**  So even though you can have trichoderma afrocarotia, you can have many, many, many, many, many,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  many strains.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  Very few are useful in agriculture.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:28):**  And in fact, the thousands and thousands of strains we've screened, there's only six that  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  we've recommended for commercialization.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  And they either are commercialized or they will be when EPA registrations are obtained.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  So of all those strains out there in the wild, if everything in the soil has a fit, it plays  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:51):**  some role.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  What is the role of trichoderma in the soil microbiome?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  Well, there are several.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  It's a very diverse species.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:05):**  In some cases, there are trichoderma strains that, for example, in cocoa, grow throughout  
**[0:06:15-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:15):**  the plant, all over the plant, and induce systemic resistance and control diseases.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  There are other strains that live on wood and are part of the decay process of wood  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  along with some other fungi.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  So when they're recycling organic matter, they're very much involved.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  There are a few strains that are not good.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  Trichoderma aggressiveum is a very important pathogen in mushrooms.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  And when we first started with trichoderma, and we'll back up a little bit, a very important  
**[0:07:08-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  corollary of all this is that when I started this, based on morphology,  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  there were nine species identified according to one treatise.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:28):**  Now based on molecular techniques, there's 258.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:33):**  And this has really been very important because, for example, people when we first started  
**[0:07:38-0:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  talking about what was then called trichoderma, now Afro-Hertzianum, it was not known to be  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:51):**  distinct from the mushroom pathogens, but with a new taxonomy that was able to distinguish  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  those.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  There are other strains of trichoderma that, especially in the division Longibrechia Adam,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  that are reduced trichothecine toxins, and those are bad guys.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  But that's restricted to that one group.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:16):**  So with taxonomy, we can restrict and we can find the bad actors as opposed to the ones  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  that are providing useful characteristics.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:28):**  So if we go back to those disease suppressing soils that you saw, can you make the assumption  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  then that those had high levels of the strains that would be beneficial to agricultural crops  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  just naturally occurring in them?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  Yes.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:47):**  In one case, I had a colleague who wanted to control Phytophthora on apples, and we looked  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  and looked and looked for strains that would work.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  And the only place we could find any were in a suppressive soil that was oppressive  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  to an organism called Afanomyses, which causes P root rot.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  And they used to be there.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  There's a whole literature says that they were there, but we went and sampled fields  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  in the Genesee River Valley.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  They weren't there.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:22):**  And I mean, the disease wasn't there.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  So we went back and isolated it.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  We got a strain, Trichoderma virans strain 41, that from that suppressive soil, it's  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  we'll use quite widely now for control of Pythium and Phytophthora and a lot of these  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  diseases.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  And so the suppressive soils are a very useful source for the good guys.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  So even on a biological level, what makes Trichoderma dominant over disease producing  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  fungi and organisms?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  Why does that win when you have disease suppressing organisms and these Trichodermas in the same  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  soil?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  So the answer, for the most part, not to, you can never say in every case, but for the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:23):**  most part, it's because of this ability to colonize roots and to induce the plant to  
**[0:10:34-0:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  become to control the diseases so that you can have disease on the foliage.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:45):**  And even though the Trichoderma is only in the roots, it controls that disease on the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:49):**  foliage.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  How does it do that?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  So say powdery mildew is an example.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  So you have Trichoderma in the roots, you have a plant growing, powdery mildew shows  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  up on the foliage.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:59):**  It doesn't show up, that's the point.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  Trichoderma is there.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  And so what happens is it's a Trichoderma, there's a complex interaction with the plant  
**[0:11:15-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:15):**  cell membranes that induces the plant to produce active disease controlling properties.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  And these go systemically and they're transduced throughout the entire plant.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  So when we started, we thought other things were going on.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  For example, Trichoderma is very good at parasitizing other fungi, wraps around them.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  And when we thought this had to be the mechanism, because we could see it on, for example, in  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  soil and on seeds, but it's not the primary mechanism.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  The primary mechanism in most cases is this induced systemic resistance.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  And so the plant controls it, but this plant is told to produce it through by the activity  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  of the fungi.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  So is it the plant producing antibiotics or something that disease-  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  Well, yeah, they're analogous to antibiotics.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  There are pretty well recognized pathways for what they're called induced systemic resistance  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  and systemic acquired resistance, and they're separate pathways, although there's crosstalk  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:45):**  between the two.  
**[0:12:49-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  And these pathways are quite useful for controlling diseases and some of them through the same  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  mechanisms they also increase photosynthesis, they increase resistance to stresses like  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:10):**  drought, salt, and this sort of thing.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:12):**  They increase plant yield or they induce an increase in plant yield.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  One of the really important things is that they increase root growth.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  And so the roots grow deeper, bigger, stronger.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:30):**  And of course, that's really good as another aspect to drought resistance.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  So they're multifunctional.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  Right.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:39):**  Well, inducing the plant to protect itself, is it more, and this is more on the plant  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:46):**  level, is the plant killing what's on it from these induced chemicals?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:52):**  No, the killing is not what they do.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  They suppress it.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  And this is one of the reasons there's an advantage to these biologicals over chemicals,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  because if you have a chemical that's lethal, then it kills whatever organism it comes in  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:10):**  contact with.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  But trichoderma and the induced resistance systems don't kill it, so the pathogen can  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  still stick around, but it's controlled so that it doesn't cause disease.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  And so because it's not lethal, there's not the selection for resistant types.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  What's the evolutionary advantage of that?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  Why have the pathogens stick around versus saying, go away?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  Well, I don't know about the evolutionary advantage, but there's a big advantage to  
**[0:14:48-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  us because, as I say, resistance doesn't develop because they're still there.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  So they're just controlled, suppressed, but they're not eliminated.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  So the plant goes on growing, pathogens there, the pathogen can't do what it would want to  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  do.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  Right.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:12):**  So it's going along in a very feeble sort of way, but it's still there.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:17):**  Right.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  And it's still there on life support per se.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  And there's a fine line between pathogenicity and beneficial organisms.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  So they both infect the plant.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  It's just what they do when they get into the plant that makes the difference.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  If that's being done through chemical signals, gene expression, does that get transmitted  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  through seeds to the next...  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  That's an interesting question.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:48):**  One of the things that happens in this, there's a thing called gene priming.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:53):**  And gene priming is something that's established when in response to the biocontrol agents,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  among other things.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  And they alter the upstream regulatory regions so that when a stress or a disease occurs,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  either biological or abiotic, when stress occurs, the response is more rapid and more  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:26):**  complete.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  And so this is what's called gene priming and it has to do with the upstream regulation  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  of RNA.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  Now that upstream regulation of RNA could conceivably be transmitted through seeds.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  So there could be generational improvements.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:48):**  I have seen papers to that effect, but I don't have personal knowledge that this does occur.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  What about in the Trigoderma itself?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:58):**  Is it getting feedback from the plant?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  So it is.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  Yes.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  That is really important.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  There's always the two-way dialogue between the plant and the organisms that infect it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:15):**  And so for sure, one of the things it gets is all the nutrition it needs, all the carbon,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:23):**  all the nutrients, that's where it gets it.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  And so the plant is, they're a co-equal partner.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  There's a really intriguing interaction with either mycorrhizae or rhizobium in the plant.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  So if you have, and this is pretty much applicable to either one, you have a common symbiotic  
**[0:17:54-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  pathway is what it's called.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  If the rhizobium, for example, is in the seed or in the soil, and it is cued to grow and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  infect by the plant, at the same time, the rhizobium sends signals to the plant that  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  allows it to be infected.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  Then once it's infected, there's a thing called an infection thread.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:35):**  And the infection thread takes the rhizobium cells and it actually gives it a pathway to  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  the cells that the plant wants to have it infect.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:47):**  And then the plant gets in there and infects those cells and you begin to have nodule formation.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  And then that's a whole complex interaction.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  So that the rhizobium then changes its type from a free-living bacteria to a bacteroid,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  it's called, which is a cell in the nodule.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:22):**  The nodule is a combination of tissue from both the plant and the rhizobium.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  But trichoderma would be different.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  That's not infecting the plant.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:34):**  Yes, it is infecting the plant.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  It is.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  So do you have that same relationship where the trichoderma is actually inside plant cells?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  Yes.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  Yes.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:45):**  That's what I mean by the endophytic nature of it.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  It's internal to the plant.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  And one of the advantages to this system is if you had a free-living organism out in the  
**[0:20:00-0:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  soil, it would be subject to all the issues of drought or unfavorable conditions that  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  might not survive.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:14):**  But if it's in the plant, if the plant survives, so does the trichoderma.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:19):**  So the plant protects the trichoderma and the trichoderma causes benefit to the plant.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  So it's a true symbiotic relationship.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:29):**  Given that you have this two-way conversation between the plants and the trichoderma, let's  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  say powdery mildew again affects the leaves, the plant starts doing things to suppress  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  it.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  Does the trichoderma get feedback on like, well, okay, that's infecting you so it can  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  then evolve and iterate?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  So it may be...  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  No, I don't think so.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  But it does though.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:50):**  The trichoderma just induces the plant to produce the chemicals that control the fungus  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  or the pathogen.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  And how does the trichoderma then, like mildew lands on leave, that puts some sort of chemical  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  in the plant sap and then the trichoderma can identify that and say, whoa, we got an  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:12):**  invader here and then it's...  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  No, not quite.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  The trichoderma, when it's infected the plant, it does this gene priming thing when in interaction  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  with membranes.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  And there's a whole lot of chemicals, the trichoderma or rhizobium or mycorrhizae,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  producing they're not the same, that interact with the plant and then you get the signal  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  transduction and the plant takes it from there.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  So the trichoderma doesn't know whether there's an infection or not, but it just makes it  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  possible for the plant to control the infection.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:58):**  On a disease suppression level and pathogen level, if you think of agricultural diseases  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  out there like the known ones, how effective is trichoderma at increasing plant resistance  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  to most known diseases?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  Depends on the type of disease, but things like powdery mildew, it does.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:22):**  But for things like rust, it doesn't because there are different type of pathogen.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  So it depends on the pathogen and the interaction.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  But one of the things that even with the rust, the plant health has increased and so that  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  provides just an overall baseline of health that it really improves the situation.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  I know this isn't your area of expertise, but I've talked to scientists in the past  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  that have worked with basil and powdery mildew resistance in basil as a trait that's passed  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  on through there.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  How does resistance through trait differ than resistance through this gene priming via trichoderma?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:11):**  Well, it depends.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:16):**  In the trait-based things, the plant traits, this is a plant property.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  I mean the plant, it's part of the genetic framework of the plant.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:27):**  And with trichoderma, that genetic framework is altered, especially in the upstream regulatory  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  regions to accomplish the same thing.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:38):**  So the end result is the same chemicals in the plant, but the means for by which it gets  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  there is different.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  One common crop growing throughout the US that I think a lot of people have issues with  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  disease of is tomatoes.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  With powdery mildew, with blight, can trichoderma affect the diseases of tomato?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  They can.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:05):**  It depends on the diseases, but for example, late blight, I don't think it will do anything  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  for...  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  Nothing much does anything for late blight except pulling out the plants.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  And if somebody, I'm trying to think too, like a lot of people listening to this, they're  
**[0:24:25-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:25):**  into, let's say, they're trying to encourage healthy soil microbiome through their practices.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  How do you, let's say you didn't even add any trichoderma, but you wanted to encourage  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  what was there to have the best chance of thriving.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:42):**  What would you want to do in terms of agricultural practices to make sure that any wild trichoderma  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  can expand, take over as much as possible or grow so you have that in the soil?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  Well, one of the things you want to do for healthy soils is you'll increase microbial  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  diversity and whatever that means.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:02):**  And there are lots of studies and it's just a bewildering array of different organisms  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  that are involved in this, but microbial diversity is a good thing.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  And so anything you can do to increase microbial diversity is good.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  The more roots you have, for example, the better off you are.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  Volatiles can help them, biochar can help that.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  And to go back to trichoderma, it increases root growth and increasing root growth is  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:43):**  one of the ways you increase microbial diversity.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  One of the things that was first found by Bernie Glick up in Guelph is that if you have  
**[0:25:55-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  oil contaminated soils, you can remediate them through adding some bacteria that he  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  has and they don't themselves remediate the soil, but they increase the root growth and  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  the plant health so that the plant is more able to cope with stress, the stress of the  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  oil.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  And so then the plant survives mixed roots and then there are other microorganisms that  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  grow in the area that actually do the degradation of the oil.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:30):**  And we have the same result in some work we did years ago with trichoderma.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  We haven't published that.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:36):**  The whole concept of soil health, there are quite a few things you can do and cover crops  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  are really important for this.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  Do you think for the average grower, and I know it's tough to say, again, you can't answer  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:54):**  in all cases, but if you had good growing practices, like you're using cover crops,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:59):**  you're not doing a lot of tillage, you're doing everything you can to encourage a robust  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:02):**  microbial community that just doing that is enough?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  Or do you think that adding a cultured out trichoderma strain to the soils is going to  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  make things that much better?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  Yes, it will make things that much better.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:22):**  You can get there with cover cropping and composting and these kinds of things.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  But added microbial strains is a good thing.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  For example, if you have legumes, you certainly want to add rhizobium.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:35):**  Rhizobiac sometimes are not rhizobium species.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  Also you can get nitrogen fixation and trichoderma can aid all of this as well.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:51):**  One of the questions you have is how expensive is it to maintain a solid vegetation cover  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  on your crops?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  For example, corn in this climate, you can't hardly do that because by the time the corn  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  silage is too late to plant the cover crop and they won't grow, you know, freeze.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  But it's a very good practice.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  There are some issues with how you can do this.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  For example, cover cropping, as I just mentioned, and if you have to add compost or biochar,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  there's a huge amount of material you have to add to the field.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:37):**  I mean tons and tons and tons and tons and tons.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  So that becomes really a logistical and a financial nightmare to do all that.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  Doing some reading myself on trichoderma, I know that it, you know, it produces cellulase  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  so it digests cellulose in some of them.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  And it doesn't have that plant relationship.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:03):**  Is that what it's doing?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  It's breaking down that other organic matter in the soil?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  Yes, that's one of its primary ecological niches is the degradation of organic waste  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  and of course then recycling all that back.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  Increasing organic matter in soil is a very, very good thing.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  That increases soil health too.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  It's hard to do though.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  Right.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  You know, one other thing I was looking at is it can grow at an extremely fast rate on  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  some of those.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  Yes, it's very fast.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  So up to an inch a day, like what can some of the hyphae in trichoderma, if you were  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  in a good situation, like how vast could one quote organism be?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  Is this something that could stretch meters on its own?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  No, not on its own.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  But if it's colonizing the roots and it's moving with the roots, then it occupies an  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  entire soil environment.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:06):**  Wherever the roots are, the trichoderma will be too.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  And so the fungus doesn't grow like that, really extensively, but it accomplishes the  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  same factor by the medium of the plant.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  What do you think is explaining the increased root growth with the introduction of trichoderma?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  Is it the trichoderma saying, you know, grow more, I'll help you out here.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  If you get bigger, I can protect you.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  Just put down more roots and we'll get more of us.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:37):**  Like why, what's inducing that growth response in roots?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  Well, one of the really important things is photosynthesis because everything we're talking  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  about here, disease resistance, and we haven't talked about mineral nutrition, but that is  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  involved.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  Increased photosynthesis, increased plant growth, all these things require fixed carbon  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:03):**  and requires energy in the form of the fixed carbon.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:08):**  And so without increasing photosynthesis, you can't do any of these things.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:15):**  But if you do increase photosynthesis, that's one of the things that allows the plants to  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:20):**  grow bigger and better and stronger and have deeper roots.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  And it's an absolute requirement.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:29):**  Do you see a difference in performance on C3 versus C4 plants?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  I don't know.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:37):**  I'm just thinking.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  Well, we have good effects on corn and soybeans, so maybe that's your answer.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  Let's go back to that mineral nutrition.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  How does that play into this picture?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  It's important.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  Mineral nutrition, their materials are in the soil, iron, phosphorus that are there,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  but they're not soluble.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  The plant can't take them up.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:13):**  And so the ability to take up those nutrients is very important.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  And trachoderma can help solubilize those insoluble materials.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  And so it can increase the uptake of phosphorus and potassium.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  Well, potassium doesn't apply because it's readily available.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  But iron.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  And one of the things, the reason for their existence in commercial agriculture for mycorrhizae  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  is that they are able to extend way out into the soil.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  And they do have a very, very wide network of hyphae.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  And they can even translocate nutrients from one plant to the next.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  But one of the things that they do is they solubilize phosphorus and they package it.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:09):**  And then they go into, there's a low garbuscule inside the root.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  So there's a great deal of surface area with the plant membrane.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:19):**  And it transfers that phosphorus into the plant.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  And the plant, of course, again, it's a symbiosis.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  The plant then provides all the nutrition that the mycorrhizae needs.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  So this is a very beneficial interaction.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  And in essence, the carbon is 42% of plants.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  So it's the largest component of plants.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  And with increased photosynthesis, which you can consider as a carbon as a nutrient, the  
**[0:34:04-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  increased photosynthesis then really improves plant growth because that's a required resource.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  How much of an understanding do you think we have at this point of how that communication  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  between plant and microbe works?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:23):**  Do we know what signals are actually being sent?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:26):**  Yes, we do.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  Especially with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:28):**  I mentioned the common synthetic pathway, common symbiotic pathway.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  This one is worked out fairly well.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  It's really very, very well known.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:46):**  And it's really interesting because one of the keys, I think, to all these symbioses,  
**[0:34:52-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:52):**  was mycorrhizae, they evolved way before even plants were evolving into monocots and dicots.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  Very early they became partners with plants, very primitive plants.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  And this has been perpetuated out to now.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  Mycorrhizae, that's a term, I'm hearing it, a lot of people are familiar with that.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  Are trichoderma grouped into that category?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  No, they are not.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  They're not mycorrhizae.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  Mycorrhizae are a very separate group.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  And one of the factors that makes them difficult to commercialize is that they can't live outside  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  the plant.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:47):**  They have to have the plant.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  You can do it in plant tissue culture or something like that.  
**[0:35:52-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:52):**  But to produce commercially mycorrhizae, you probably need to grow a plant and then harvest  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  the plant roots.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  And so that means that it's expensive, it's difficult, and you can never have a pure culture.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  And what's more, unlike what we've been able to do with trichoderma, it's very difficult  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  because you can't put it in a petri dish and look at it.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  It's very difficult to develop improvement except just through selection.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  Can you have a root in the soil that's having interactions with trichoderma, mycorrhizae,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  let's say it's a legume rhizobia, all at the same time at different parts?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  Yes, you can.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:40):**  And you do, it happens.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:45):**  What's unique about trichoderma then?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  Because I've talked to other scientists who've looked at mycorrhizae and other microbes in  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:53):**  the soil.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  And just like you're saying, you can't isolate them in a lab.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  They tend to function either with a living plant or they need that community around them  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:04):**  in the soil to actually function.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:06):**  Why is trichoderma unique in the sense that you can put it in a petri dish, you can observe  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  it versus...  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:12):**  Well, I don't know why, but it's certainly an advantage.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  And it's certainly an advantage because you can manipulate it, you can select, you can  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  screen thousands and thousands of strains and you can save all the cultures back.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  So you can have this very large collection of these strains that you can go back to if  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  you want to, and we have done that.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  And you can't do that with mycorrhizae.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:47):**  Right.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  If you were a grower and you wanted to add in application of this, could you do it at  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  the seed level?  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:57):**  Yes, that's one of the primary ways.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:00):**  That's for row crops, that's the only economical way to do it.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  And there are many millions of dollars, I just have something back here, a letter from  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  Bard which I talked about.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:18):**  The current net value of trichoderma to agriculture is $694 million.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  And that is primarily through seed treatments.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  There are other ways, any way you can deliver the trichoderma to the roots works.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  You can do a root dip, you can do it with transplants, you can do it in greenhouses,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:48):**  you can add it to the soil, to the potting medium, it's not necessarily soil, and then  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  it will colonize and create the benefits that you want.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:00):**  Is it somewhere you could dip a seed in it, let it dry out, and it would sit there until  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  the seed is planted?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  Now, I say yes very glibly, but we work for years and years and years getting techniques  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  and formulations that will permit you to do that, to have seed treatments that really  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  are effective.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  For large-scale commercial use, you need to have liquid formulations.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:32):**  And liquid formulations are, if you put the spores in water, bad things are going to happen.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  You're going to get mold contamination, things like that, so you have to develop formulations,  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:47):**  which we have done, so that you can have stable liquid formulations.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  And these can be applied in large-scale seed treaters, and that's required for the seed  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  treatment.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  And one of the real advantages is because trichoderma are resistant to many, many fungicides,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:09):**  so that you can apply them over the top of a fungicide-treated seed.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:15):**  Is it something where, reading one of your papers here, you can add it as a seed treatment,  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  the best strains will colonize the root surface even when roots grow a meter or more, and  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  they can persist in useful numbers up to 18 months after application.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  So if you treated seed, say, for this season, the trichoderma grow with the roots in the  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  soil, and then next season, let's say I treat the next set of seeds.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  Can I assume that now, since I already had a previous crop in there that had a good strain  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:47):**  of trichoderma associated with them, I now have a higher level in the soil because I  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  had previous...  
**[0:40:52-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  No, and this is a big advantage to commercialization, maybe not so much to other things, because  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  if the roots go away, the trichoderma drops below useful levels.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  And so every year you have to re-inoculate.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  In the past, when I've talked to proponents of biologicals, I've heard this quote, they're  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:15):**  viewed by growers as inconsistent at best, snake oil at worst.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  What do you think about that?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  Yeah, that is the reputation.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:30):**  And I can tell you that overall, for example, if you take plant yield, the overall effect  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  is to increase plant yield, but you can't guarantee that any particular grower in any  
**[0:41:45-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:45):**  particular field will have that increased yield.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  And that's the same with any other input that you make, except maybe if the case of where  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  really nitrogen pours oils and you add nitrogen.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  But it's a harder sell because that is...I think there was an article in Corn Farmer  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  that was talking about my work and the companies that I'm associated with.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  And they said trichoderma, something to this effect, and no part of it is exactly right.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  The next boon for corn farmers or fufu dust.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  And that pretty much expresses the opinion and what anybody wanting to sell trichoderma  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  or any other microbial inoculant has to deal with.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  One other factor that limits the amount of trichoderma, for example, corn is a proprietary  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:06):**  product.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  And so you have a few large companies, very few, that control the entire corn market.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:14):**  And they will not allow, if you open the bag and add anything to it, it voids the warranty.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:23):**  And so people are not going to apply trichoderma if they're going to have their warranty weighted.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  So that's a major limitation.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:39):**  A lot of people listening to this are growers of higher value crops.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  They're not growing corn, they're growing things like lettuces that they carry a higher  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:47):**  market value.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:48):**  And they're growing on smaller acreage.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  Like they're probably 10 acres or less, most people listening to this.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:54):**  So at the application cost of three to, let's say it's even $10 an acre and you have 10  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  acres, is there any reason you wouldn't try it?  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:04):**  Yes, there is.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  And that is because it's frequently not sold for those applications.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:13):**  Because for example, if you do a seed treatment, how much trichoderma can you apply on a lettuce  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  seed?  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  A very small amount.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  So if the grower uses on lettuce seed, he won't spend $10, he will spend 10 cents.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:34):**  And of course that's not economically feasible.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:38):**  So for seed treatments it's not marketed for that, for those purposes for those small seeds.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:45):**  It's just a misfit between the amount that you can obtain and revenue versus the...  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:56):**  And so it's not worth doing.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:58):**  But that's from the commercial side, but from the grower side, like if they could acquire  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:03):**  trichodermery and even put it through their drip irrigation system.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  Yeah, that is a thing that has been done.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  There's a very interesting example.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  One of my colleagues who is now the director, which is the highest official at the University  
**[0:45:34-0:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  of Naples in Italy, University of Napoli, had a project with the South American company.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:45):**  And they were growing a mixture of beneficial microbes, and I once knew what they were,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  but I can't tell you.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  But they were growing them in a reactor and they were pumping that directly from their  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:59):**  reactor into the irrigation water.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  And a great many of the cantaloupes that we buy were treated that way.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:08):**  And they really suppressed disease.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  Another way that things have been brought forward, I had a colleague in Costa Rica,  
**[0:46:23-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:23):**  and there's other people too, and they were for local distribution, they had a small production  
**[0:46:32-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  facility and they grew the trichoderma on grain in whiskey bottles.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  And then they took the trichoderma, they delivered it directly to the strawberry growers, and  
**[0:46:45-0:46:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  the strawberry growers were using it and having no disease at all.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:53):**  Could you apply it foliarly?  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  You can.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:57):**  We have done that.  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:58):**  It's not done commercially.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  It could be, regulatory aspects, I'll come back to that, are what limit that.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  But we do have some good results on turf, on other crops, and it's quite possible to  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  do this.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  And you can also integrate it with chemical applications, either in alternating sprays  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  or even in tank mixes, and that's effective too.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  But it isn't done commercially.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:30):**  And the reason for this is regulatory.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  To get a regulatory approval for, it's quite expensive to get regulatory approval for anything,  
**[0:47:42-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:42):**  even soil applications, because you have to do toxicity, dermal toxicity.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  There's a six pack, and I won't try to reel them up right now, but there's a six pack  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:58):**  that you have to do, and that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and does.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  I'm not sure exactly the numbers.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  But then in addition to that, if you go to foliar application, now you have to do bee  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  studies.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  You have to do quail feeding studies.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:22):**  You have to do Drosophila if it's going to be used near waterways.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  And all that really adds to the expense.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:29):**  Right.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  Let's say this is just even in a lab setting.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  If you applied it foliarly, would it coat the above ground portion of the plant like  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  it does the root?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  Well, I can tell you some of our experience with grapes.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  We were looking at Botrytis, a gray mold on grapes.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  We were applying it.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  There were experiments going on in Chile and experiments going on in New York.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  We were applying it to the foliage, and it was having long term effects on control of  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  Botrytis, even at low levels.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:06):**  So I'm assuming that this, even though it's applied foliarly, this is an induced resistance  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  phenomenon.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  Do you think that Trichoderma is living on the leaf surface and getting a nutrient exchange  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:19):**  there?  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:20):**  I don't know.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  We haven't investigated that enough to know for certain.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  It could be that you have this gene priming effect and once it's induced, it persists.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  And the trichoderma just dies off and could be gone.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:35):**  Could be gone because you got ultraviolet radiation and things like that, unless it's  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  internal into the plant.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:40):**  And there's an organism called Clonostachys that I've worked on.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  And this does internally infect the plant and induce resistance.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:48):**  And I don't know if Trichoderma does the same thing, but it internally induces resistance  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  to some pretty important pathogens like again, gray mold on various crops and also take off  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  or not take off head blight of corn.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:06):**  And that's very important because head blight causes major toxic problems.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:14):**  And so that Clonostachys is systemic and persists in the above ground parts of the plant.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:23):**  Is there any way that if you did apply it as a foliar application that it could make  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  its way through the plant to the roots?  
**[0:50:32-0:50:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  I don't know.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:34):**  I don't know.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  In a few cases, we know that that's the case.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:39):**  For example, Trichoderma on cocoa, it goes throughout the plant.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  It goes throughout the plant.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:46):**  But if you take the same strains that go throughout the plant and cocoa and inoculate them onto  
**[0:50:53-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:53):**  pepper, it only colonizes the roots.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  So it's a plant specific trait.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:02):**  Why do you hypothesize that cocoa has this unique relationship, but most other...  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  I don't know.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:08):**  It does, but I don't know why.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:10):**  There's some other tropical trees that have a whole lot of endophytic organisms in them  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  that really aid their ability to function and produce.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  If we go back to root colonization and let's say you have Trichoderma at the root interface  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:30):**  and it does this gene priming, does it have any effect on insect pests?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  Well, we've looked at that and not that I know of.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:41):**  Now, Metarhizum is an insect pathogen that also colonizes roots and induces disease resistance.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  So in that way, there is.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:54):**  Now, not insects, but nematodes, and again, this is a very strange specific phenomenon.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  We have the ability to control nematode egg laying in corn and tomato.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  We know this in field trials and in lab trials.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  And again, this is an induced response and it doesn't really reduce the amount of nematodes  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  in this first year, but there is almost no egg laying.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  So the next year there won't be any nematodes.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:32):**  And this is, and at the same time, we're getting growth promotion of the plant.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  So this is a very useful thing.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  This is a trait that is, this is why we have to have EPA registration before you can make  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  pest control claims.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:51):**  And I think that's probably pretty close to happening.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  I know you're not an insect guy, but do you have any thoughts on this?  
**[0:52:59-0:53:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  You apply trichoderma, you get a plant that is healthier and more resistant to disease.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:09):**  Therefore it's less prone to insect predation.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:14):**  Well, it may be more tolerant of insects, insect infestations, just because there's  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  a greater health of the plant.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  I wish that was the case with my ice trees that have all died from emerald ash borer.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  There's some, say, worry unknown around applying biologicals across wide geographic regions  
**[0:53:43-0:53:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  in the ability of them to persist.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:46):**  Like if you apply them in Geneva, Southern California, Portland, or Phoenix, Arizona,  
**[0:53:53-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  what have you seen with trichoderma?  
**[0:53:55-0:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:55):**  Is it pretty biome agnostic or does it need the right environment to really work?  
**[0:54:03-0:54:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:03):**  As long as the plants are growing, then you're okay.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:11):**  Because they're inside the root.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:12):**  So once they colonize the root, then they're good to go for the life of the crop.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  As long as the plant can survive, the trichoderma survives.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:25):**  On application, is it just a live root is what they would need in the soil?  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  If you're going to apply them as a soil drench or through a drip line or something like that,  
**[0:54:35-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  they just need to be able to find live roots versus heavy roots.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  That's all they need.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:39):**  Okay, so you don't need like a food in the soil for them to consume.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  No.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:44):**  No, we've looked at, we've looked in seed treatments with food bases and things like  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  that because we thought, well, we could really make things grow well.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:52):**  The problem is you also get other things growing well.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  So the competition is more difficult.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:59):**  So usually don't get any advantage by adding food bases.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:05):**  Just get in the roots and to the roots in some fashion or other through a drench, through  
**[0:55:11-0:55:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  a drip, even granular formulations that are applied to the surface of the soil.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:18):**  And then as the rain comes, then the forager works down to the roots.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  One thing in regards to say marketing of these things, and you even see it in some pictures  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:30):**  online and studies is you'll see plant A and then you'll see plant B, which has had X done  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  to it.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:38):**  And plant B usually looks a lot better.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  It's bigger, it's more vigorous, whatever, bigger fruit.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:43):**  In your experience, when you do studies like this and when you see this, is there, are  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:48):**  they cherry picking the best one to show you or if there was a hundred?  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  That's a real interesting thing because yes, there is some cherry picking, but it's also  
**[0:56:01-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  real.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  And so if it happens, it happens.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:06):**  Now one of the things when we were talking about to commercial people, I say, well, you  
**[0:56:12-0:56:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  showed all these beautiful pictures, but it's a one-off test.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:15):**  You've got to test it over thousands of acres and hundreds of years, well, not hundreds  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:22):**  of years, but many years before you can be sure.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  And so commercially, that's pretty much coming to realization, but it's a big hell to climb  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  because there is always the feeling, well, you're just cherry picking, you've got this  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:42):**  one result, you can't reproduce it.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:45):**  And you have to find the factors that don't permit you to reproduce it.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:51):**  In some cases, we know what those are.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  For example, in corn, certain types of corn are indeterminate.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:59):**  That means that they just grow and grow and grow.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:01):**  There's usually varieties that are selected for silage, but others are selected just for  
**[0:57:08-0:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:08):**  grain and they're going to grow as big as they're going to grow and that's all.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:13):**  So you don't see the big yield advantage or growth advantage on those determinate varieties,  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  but you can see it on the indeterminate ones.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  And so you have to know something about your crop and where it's likely to be successful  
**[0:57:29-0:57:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  and where it isn't.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:30):**  So you applied it to a determining corn plant, like that the trait of the plant is going  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  to affect its above ground growth.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  Did you see a more vigorous, robust root system?  
**[0:57:46-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:46):**  I don't know that for sure.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  I'm just thinking back over the years, we frequently see more robust root systems.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:02):**  I'm thinking of an experiment we did in a field where we had corn and there was nitrogen  
**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:15):**  in huge quantities there.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  So there was not going to be a yield advantage, but I've never had the nerve to do this again.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  We took a backhoe in the field and we dug down through the soil, through the root zone  
**[0:58:33-0:58:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:33):**  down to six feet depth.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  Then people had to go down in these trenches and we washed it with a power washer so that  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:46):**  you could see the roots on the wall of the trench.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:50):**  We put map pins wherever there was a root and then we counted the map pins.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  We did this in a replicated trials and it was considerably enhanced even though there  
**[0:59:00-0:59:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:00):**  was no effect on yield and above ground plant growth.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:03):**  It's the only time we've ever done that.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:06):**  So it's a single observation.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  It's a lot of work, very difficult to do.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  And that's the problem with soil and root growth.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  You've got to be able to see the roots and soil is not very visible.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:23):**  You can't see through the roots.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  So you've got to dig it up and then if you dig it up, you destroy the roots.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  And so it's quite a difficult thing.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:36):**  Trichotron in the wild, how is it reproducing?  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:42):**  Mostly asexually by spores.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:47):**  So there are many, many, many, millions of spores produced and high in high P2, but the  
**[0:59:54-0:59:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:54):**  spores are the persistent structures.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:57):**  So they're primarily living as these asexual spores.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  Are all the spores underground or do some of those become airborne?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  They become airborne.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  I can't give you chapter and verse on that, but especially in the ones that, and there  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:22):**  are species of trichoderma that are very good wood colonizers.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  So they colonize decaying wood and they do have a sexual stage.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:33):**  And these asexual spores are all over the surface and you can see them.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  They're frequently read, fruiting structures, and you can easily see those.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:44):**  And certainly those are airborne.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:46):**  I suspect the trichoderma canidii, if they're exposed to the air, will become airborne too.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:52):**  But I don't really know.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:53):**  I would never try to do that.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:56):**  The reason I ask is because I've seen methods where people will use rice to try and wild  
**[1:01:06-1:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:06):**  harvest a mold, which I'm assuming in this case is some trichoderma.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:11):**  They'll put rice in an area of the field and they'll cover it with a towel so insects aren't  
**[1:01:18-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:18):**  getting it.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  They'll leave it there.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  A mold shows up and then you know it's a mold because when it goes green, it's sporulated.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:27):**  And then they'll then try to multiply that out using some sucrose source.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:35):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[1:01:36-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:36):**  Is that doing anything?  
**[1:01:38-1:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  Is there anything there?  
**[1:01:40-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:40):**  I don't know.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  I wasn't aware of that.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:44):**  But it's reasonable that that would occur.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  I assume that you get a lot of things other than trichoderma.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:54):**  But I'm sure that that can happen.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  I would assume you get penicillium and stuff like that.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:01):**  For somebody who is doing that, Korean natural farming is one philosophy of agriculture that  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:09):**  does this.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:11):**  Is there a risk if you're trying to wild harvest molds like this that what you could be harvesting  
**[1:02:18-1:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:18):**  is bad and reproducing that?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:22):**  It's conceivable.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  For example, if you have corn residues on soil, especially grain, you can get proliferation  
**[1:02:31-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:31):**  of toxigenic fusarium strains.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:34):**  And those are definitely bad.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  And so, but I think it depends on the situation and what's likely to happen in any particular  
**[1:02:46-1:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  case.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:49):**  I worry a little bit about manure teas and things like that.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  I would think that there is a possibility that you get toxic or deleterious microorganisms  
**[1:03:00-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:00):**  if you do manure teas because it's an uncontrolled process and you don't know what's going to  
**[1:03:04-1:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:04):**  grow.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:07):**  So I would never advocate that.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:09):**  People do and they have good results with it.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:13):**  But to me, it's risky.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:19):**  Is there any way that you'd know of for somebody at home to culture out trichoderma in a way  
**[1:03:26-1:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:26):**  that would actually be significant and meaningful?  
**[1:03:30-1:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:30):**  No, because it's so strain specific, you have to have the right strains.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:35):**  You can culture trichoderma in unlimited numbers and quantities and types, but most of them  
**[1:03:46-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  won't be particularly beneficial.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  But it is possible to buy useful trichoderma preparations on the web.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:57):**  Having worked in that sector, developed these preparations, what would you advise somebody  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:05):**  to look for if they are purchasing it to know that they're purchasing something, one that  
**[1:04:10-1:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  is going to be effective, it's the right strain?  
**[1:04:13-1:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:13):**  What would you look for?  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:15):**  Well, I know of course, and I'm going to be buying root shield, probably root shield this  
**[1:04:23-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:23):**  year from BioWorks.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  It's one of my strains.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:28):**  I know that it works and there may be others as well, but root shield may be the most common  
**[1:04:37-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:37):**  one that you can buy.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  Our root shield plus has two strains and that one can be, you can buy it, I think it's about  
**[1:04:51-1:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  $100 for a package, but if you take that and you use what you want, you put the rest in  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:56):**  the freezer, you can keep it for years and years and years and years and years.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  Well, literally freezer, not fridge.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:04):**  Refrigerator is good, freezer is better.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:09):**  Is that something where you're getting a powder essentially?  
**[1:05:14-1:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:14):**  Yes, it is a powder.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:16):**  That with water?  
**[1:05:17-1:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:17):**  Okay, okay.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  So, what I'm going to do this spring or this late winter when I start my tomatoes and squash  
**[1:05:29-1:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  and things like that, I'm going to just mix it with the planning medium.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:35):**  I'm not close, it's done commercially in greenhouses.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:41):**  So it's there in the planning medium, you put your seed in, is that, there's enough  
**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:46):**  of a quick time sequence there that wants that seed?  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  Yeah, there is.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:52):**  Okay, it's fascinating what it can do and some of these other things that I've seen  
**[1:05:59-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:59):**  talked about it, one is, and you talked about this isn't why you think it suppressed disease,  
**[1:06:07-1:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  unless I'm missing up terms, correct me if I'm wrong, but, antibiotics is one thing you'll  
**[1:06:12-1:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:12):**  see when trichoderma, you read something.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:16):**  Trichoderma do make antibiotic materials.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:20):**  The strain, I mentioned 41 of trichoderma virans produces gluotoxin and gluotoxin, their  
**[1:06:28-1:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:28):**  modal zoospores of Pythium and Phytophthora and Afanolysis and it's incredibly lethal  
**[1:06:38-1:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:38):**  to them.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:39):**  So that may be a factor in the control of those ovomycetes, they're not fungi, they're  
**[1:06:47-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:47):**  filamentous but they're not fungi.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  And so this may be involved, but induced resistance is also involved.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  So there may be probably multiple mechanisms, but an anabiosis in general may not be so  
**[1:07:04-1:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  useful.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:05):**  I had a friend, Charlie Howell at the Texas A&M and he published a long time on the ability  
**[1:07:14-1:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  of one of the trichoderma strains, the species escapes me right now, to control seedling  
**[1:07:25-1:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:25):**  diseases of cotton.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:27):**  And he attributed this to an antibiotic that the trichoderma was producing.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  But when he did experiments, he did mutations and he had some strains that were mycoparasitic,  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  some strains that were antibiotic resistant and others that induced resistance.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:45):**  And there was no effect, no correlation between anabiosis or mycoparasitism and the control  
**[1:07:53-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:53):**  of the seedling disease, but there was a huge interaction, a perfect interaction between  
**[1:07:59-1:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  their ability to induce resistance.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:02):**  So clearly that induced resistance is the primary mechanism there.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:08):**  And this is something that has only come about relatively recently, since the 1990s, this  
**[1:08:16-1:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  misunderstanding that mycoparasitism and anabiosis, although they occur, they do occur, they're  
**[1:08:25-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:25):**  not probably in most cases the most important factor.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  With that, again, going back to that induced resistance, is there essentially a memory  
**[1:08:41-1:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:41):**  within trichoderma that expands over time?  
**[1:08:47-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:47):**  So you have your diseases that are obviously evolving.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  How does trichoderma induce disease suppression?  
**[1:08:56-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:56):**  If above ground you have the diseases evolving, the trichoderma has to be evolving as well  
**[1:09:03-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:03):**  to keep up or is it just...  
**[1:09:04-1:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  Well, it's not...  
**[1:09:06-1:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:06):**  The trichoderma doesn't have to evolve.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  The trichoderma is going to do what the trichoderma is going to do, and it's going to induce disease  
**[1:09:14-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:14):**  resistance.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  And the disease resistance in the plant is dependent upon chemicals that the plant produces  
**[1:09:23-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  that inhibit the growth of the pathogens.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:30):**  So where the evolution would have to occur, if indeed it's necessary, is in the plant's  
**[1:09:42-1:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  mechanisms, the plant systems, because the trichoderma is going to induce whatever is  
**[1:09:49-1:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:49):**  there.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:50):**  And so it's got to be plant-based.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  So the plant essentially has this deck of genes, expression.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:00):**  Deck of genes and chemicals and pathways.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:05):**  And whatever is there is there.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:06):**  So like late blight is when we go back to it.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  It doesn't have that in its deck, so it can't play that card.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  But it can't.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:13):**  Yeah, right.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  Well, there are a few varieties of tomatoes that are blight tolerant, and I don't know  
**[1:10:19-1:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  how successful those are.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:21):**  I planted some in my garden, but I didn't have late blight that year, so I can't tell.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:26):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:27):**  What do you think agriculture would look like if you saw overnight a 100% uptake of trichoderma  
**[1:10:40-1:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40):**  use?  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  I can tell you what would happen to the companies.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:43):**  They would become very profitable.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:47):**  But I would truly believe that you would probably increase overall plant yields.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:56):**  Several percentage points, maybe 10%.  
**[1:11:02-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  Because you have multiple mechanisms that are things that are going on.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  There's disease resistance, there's drought tolerance, there's resistance to all kinds  
**[1:11:11-1:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  of abiotic stresses, improved photosynthesis.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:15):**  All these things contribute.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  Just knowing what I know about soil science, I would think that this could potentially  
**[1:11:23-1:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:23):**  be an exponential effect of you have more roots, and they're going deeper.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:30):**  You're putting more sugars in the soil, that's stimulating microbes.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:33):**  So you build soil year one, year two, you're doing the same thing, and every year you're  
**[1:11:37-1:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:37):**  getting better and better and better.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:40):**  I think that you're absolutely correct.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:43):**  Where do you think, and related, trichoderma aren't mycorrhizae.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:48):**  Do you see a stage where you think you could get mycorrhizae commercialized?  
**[1:11:56-1:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:56):**  I know there's all the challenges.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:57):**  You talked about those challenges earlier, but those can be overcame.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:02):**  I don't know how.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:03):**  It's intrinsic in the mycorrhizae that they can't be cultured without the plant.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  And so I don't see how you can overcome that basic biological fact.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  There are commercial products with mycorrhizae.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:21):**  I don't know how effective they are, and I've never used them, but there are commercial  
**[1:12:26-1:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:26):**  products.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:27):**  But they're for home gardeners primarily.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:31):**  I don't think there's any wide-scale adoption.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  Now having said that, the best way to encourage mycorrhizae is to avoid soil destruction.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:43):**  Because when you have these very large networks, they go between plants, across plants, and  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  they can cover, I don't know, very large areas.  
**[1:12:55-1:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  But if you disrupt the soil, then you destroy those networks.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:01):**  And so the best thing you can do to encourage mycorrhizae is to avoid soil disturbance.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  Is there any other lab-based, and I don't mean lab-based, microbes that could be cultured  
**[1:13:15-1:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:15):**  out in a lab that are also big players in the soil matrix that would be worth looking  
**[1:13:21-1:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:21):**  at outside of trichoderma?  
**[1:13:23-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:23):**  Yeah, there probably are.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  I'm going to send you this paper that I just published, and they list some others that  
**[1:13:31-1:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  I wasn't aware of until I was writing this paper, and one of the reviewers said, well,  
**[1:13:36-1:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:36):**  you need to cite these papers.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:38):**  And so I, but there are other fungi that might be beneficial, and then it's brand new to  
**[1:13:45-1:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  me, and I've only known about it for the last two weeks.  
**[1:13:50-1:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:50):**  You've spent 40 years looking at trichoderma.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:55):**  Where do you think we are on our knowledge level of trichoderma?  
**[1:14:00-1:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:00):**  You think we're mostly there, or you think there's just still tons we don't know?  
**[1:14:05-1:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  Well, there's a lot we don't know, but we do know a great deal.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:09):**  And so can you get more bang?  
**[1:14:17-1:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  Possibly.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:20):**  And certainly the studies need to continue, but eventually you reach a saturation point,  
**[1:14:31-1:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:31):**  and then you have to let it go at that.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:36):**  One other thing that I think people worry about when adding a cultured biological to  
**[1:14:43-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:43):**  the soil is you upset whatever balance is there.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  Do you see any negative repercussions of interest?  
**[1:14:50-1:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:50):**  No, that was when we first went to do EPA registrations.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:56):**  There was a very great concern that, for example, we would disrupt mycorrhizae.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  And if you put in a petri dish, if you put mycorrhizae in trichoderma, you can grow mycorrhizae  
**[1:15:08-1:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:08):**  for a little bit in a petri dish.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:09):**  It doesn't go very far, but you can.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:12):**  The trichoderma grew over and killed it.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:15):**  But there are some nice studies out of Oregon State where they inoculated soil with both  
**[1:15:23-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  mycorrhizae and trichoderma.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  And there was no negative effect on the mycorrhizae, number one.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:32):**  There were other studies from the University of Florida where you have benefits, additive  
**[1:15:38-1:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:38):**  benefits of trichoderma and mycorrhizae if you add them both to, I think it was tomatoes  
**[1:15:49-1:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:49):**  for disease resistance.  
**[1:15:53-1:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:53):**  And so I don't know of any adverse effects.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:56):**  And we've looked.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:00):**  Hopefully we'd have some adverse effect on the pathogens, but that's okay.  
**[1:16:04-1:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:04):**  Trichoderma colonizes a root and it tells the plant, okay, you got to reprogram yourself  
**[1:16:09-1:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:09):**  to be resistant to these things should they show up.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:15):**  Why doesn't the plant already have that in it?  
**[1:16:18-1:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:18):**  Why does it need the trichoderma to come tell it to do that?  
**[1:16:20-1:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20):**  Why isn't the plant evolved to the stage to say like, I need to prime myself for all these  
**[1:16:24-1:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:24):**  things?  
**[1:16:26-1:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:26):**  Well, there is that, there is priming mechanisms, but it has to be induced by something.  
**[1:16:33-1:16:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:33):**  And it can be induced by pathogens, which you don't want to have happen because it makes  
**[1:16:37-1:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:37):**  the plant sick.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:38):**  It can be induced by particular metals.  
**[1:16:44-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:44):**  But they don't generally have this.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  And I don't know why that is.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:51):**  It could be that this is not one of the things that's selected for in plant breeding.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  And so they may have had that ability at one time.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  So it's a moral answer.  
**[1:17:03-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:03):**  She was associated with undesirable traits.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  So it's not there.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  But I don't know that's the case.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:10):**  Yeah, I think there was a study out of Washington state that talked about the breeding of plants  
**[1:17:17-1:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:17):**  potentially reducing the efficacy of mycorrhizal relationships.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:25):**  Which is the more naturalized version of the plant.  
**[1:17:28-1:17:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:28):**  Yeah, I think that's true.  
**[1:17:31-1:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:31):**  And one of the things you have to consider is that for the most part, not entirely, but  
**[1:17:35-1:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:35):**  for the most part, plants are selected for maximally under ideal growing conditions.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:43):**  And so when you have the situation where there are less than ideal growing conditions, it's  
**[1:17:51-1:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:51):**  very difficult for the plant breeders to look at these because then the variability becomes  
**[1:17:58-1:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:58):**  so great that they can't get any statistical valid results.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  So they always use these very uniform ideal growing conditions.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:06):**  Again, for the most part, if you're breeding for douse resistance, you obviously don't  
**[1:18:10-1:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:10):**  do that.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:11):**  But so I think that by selecting for things that perform optimally under ideal conditions,  
**[1:18:20-1:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:20):**  you may have lost these characteristics that may have been in wild ancestors.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:26):**  I don't know that they were, but that's a possibility.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:31):**  Yet when you introduce the fungi to them, they prime them.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:36):**  It happens.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:37):**  It turns it back on, and they may have been an ancestral capability that was there, but  
**[1:18:47-1:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47):**  I could say it was lost.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:49):**  Other organisms do the priming effect too.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:52):**  There are mycorrhizae, there is rizobium, there's a fungus called piriformis fora that  
**[1:18:59-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:59):**  does that, that does this too.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  And so trichoderma is not unique in this category.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:08):**  Again, I'll send you that paper that just was accepted today, and you will see all that  
**[1:19:15-1:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  information.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:16):**  Is the fungi, I know it doesn't have a brain, but is it essentially just looking ahead saying,  
**[1:19:20-1:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:20):**  I want to live as long as possible.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:22):**  I need you alive as long as possible so I can live as long as possible.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:26):**  That's right.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:27):**  Any organism that is the selection pressure, to being able to multiply and proliferate  
**[1:19:39-1:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:39):**  is something that all organisms try to do.  
**[1:19:43-1:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:43):**  This is inherent in the whole evolutionary process.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:49):**  If they don't proliferate, if they don't survive, then whatever it is, it's not passed on to  
**[1:19:54-1:19:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:54):**  the next generation.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:57):**  So somebody put your T22 strain into the soil.  
**[1:20:01-1:20:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:01):**  It was on a plant, it's the end of the season, winter happens, levels go down of the T22,  
**[1:20:08-1:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:08):**  so they're not really as effective, but some are still persisting in the soil.  
**[1:20:14-1:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:14):**  Do you think if you did that long enough, you'd get a locally adapted version in the  
**[1:20:19-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:19):**  soil that would likely have...  
**[1:20:21-1:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  I can't tell you that for sure.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:23):**  I don't know, but I do know that, and we had to do studies like this for the EPA, we added  
**[1:20:32-1:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:32):**  trichoderma to soybeans, I think, and we did them in plots.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:40):**  And then we removed the plants and the next year we replanted the soybeans.  
**[1:20:50-1:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:50):**  And you could detect the T22, but it only became meaningful levels by the end of the  
**[1:20:56-1:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:56):**  season.  
**[1:20:57-1:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:57):**  And so that was too late to do any good.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:59):**  And then the next year you had to start over again.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:01):**  So if we loop all the way back around to where we started, those disease suppressing soils  
**[1:21:07-1:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:07):**  had trichoderma in them, why did trichoderma exist in those soils, do you think, for as  
**[1:21:16-1:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:16):**  much as they did to cause a significant effect when nobody was adding them?  
**[1:21:20-1:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:20):**  When you go to the lab side, culture it out, you put it in and you see, okay, they're not  
**[1:21:24-1:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:24):**  at enough level to be effective.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:26):**  So why are there some soils out there where they are at a high enough level?  
**[1:21:30-1:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:30):**  What do you think is unique about those soils?  
**[1:21:32-1:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:32):**  Well, the soil, for example, in the Genesee River Valley, off and on it had been cropped  
**[1:21:39-1:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:39):**  in peas since the latter part of the 1800s.  
**[1:21:47-1:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:47):**  So for as long as people were there, white settlers, there was a selection pressure and  
**[1:21:58-1:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:58):**  advantage to the organism.  
**[1:22:00-1:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:00):**  So it probably took the better part of a century to develop, but it did occur.  
**[1:22:08-1:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:08):**  And that's about as far as it can go.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:12):**  Was there anything special about the treatment of those soils?  
**[1:22:15-1:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  Like did they, you know, were they more regeneratively managed?  
**[1:22:20-1:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:20):**  Like did they have more organic matter or they just treated like anything else?  
**[1:22:24-1:22:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:24):**  They're treated like anything else.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:26):**  The contributing factor was growing peas.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:28):**  Right.  
**[1:22:29-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:29):**  Right.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:30):**  Well, yeah, I think this has been enlightening.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:34):**  And I really want to thank you for sharing your knowledge that you've picked up over  
**[1:22:37-1:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:37):**  the course of a career with everybody.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:39):**  If people, again, want to learn more about your work, search for Gary Harman trichoderma  
**[1:22:45-1:22:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:45):**  mine.  
**[1:22:46-1:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:46):**  Yes, they can.  
**[1:22:47-1:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:47):**  And they'll find a lot.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:49):**  I'm just, I'm working on a web page on academia.  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:56):**  And I started to put some papers on there and I tried to download a bunch of them at  
**[1:23:02-1:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:02):**  once and it was too big.  
**[1:23:03-1:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-15-GaryHarman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:03):**  So I will be, I will be adding those over time.

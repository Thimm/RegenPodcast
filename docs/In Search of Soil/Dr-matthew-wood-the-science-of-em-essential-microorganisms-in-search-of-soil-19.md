### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Lactobacillus.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  LAB.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  EM.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:23):**  You've probably heard these terms mentioned a lot, or maybe you haven't.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  They're all terms that deal with a specific consortium or group of microbes that can work  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  together to benefit the soil.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  EM is one of those mysterious, yet fairly well researched topics out there in the soil  
**[0:00:46-0:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  world.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:47):**  And despite the amount of research and work that's been done in it, a lot of people don't  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  know about it, and there's a lot of misconceptions around it.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  Well, today we're going to the microbial source, and I'm talking to Dr. Matthew Wood about  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:02):**  EM.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  Now, EM is a trademark term, and that's not a trademark his company owns, but for the  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  introduction, let's say we're talking about EM, but we're really talking about the microbes  
**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  in EM.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  And today, Dr. Wood's going to talk about why you might want to look at EM, what it's  
**[0:01:20-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  capable of, and why it might be better than other forms of microbial inoculants, like  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  homemade microbial cultures and compost teas.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  Let's get into it.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  It's all about microbes with Dr. Matthew Wood of SCD Probiotics.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:37):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  All right, so if we go back to your early days of first studying microbes at University  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  of Missouri, why did you get into that field to begin with?  
**[0:01:49-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  Well, I got into it, originally I was into soil science, and I got interested in soil  
**[0:02:00-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  science because I read a book called Empty Harvest by Bernard Jensen, which talks about  
**[0:02:10-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  sort of a depletion of trace minerals in the soil and how it impacts quality of food, and  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  then therefore how it impacts human health.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:22):**  So I was really interested in that connection between soil and agricultural practices and  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  the quality of the produce and human health.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  I went to study that subject at the University of Missouri, and I was a little disappointed  
**[0:02:47-0:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  at the beginning because the curriculum and sort of the way of thinking was very chemical  
**[0:02:56-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:56):**  dominated, which is typical of big land grant universities that are strong agricultural  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  schools.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  You know, the state of Missouri, we have the headquarters of Monsanto in St. Louis, so  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  of course they're a big contributor to the school.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  And just generally the way of thinking was this chemical approach, which is dominant  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  Eventually you find yourself actually in Japan studying in Dr. Higa's lab.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  What was that experience like studying under him?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  Oh, it was amazing.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  He had a lab of about eight students, several international students, all doing Masters  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  of Science in bioproduction.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  And because of the international sort of, even back then, the international use and  
**[0:04:05-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:05):**  work going on with these concepts that Dr. Higa originally put forth in his books, because  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  it was happening all over the world, he was often invited.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  And so I did a lot of traveling with him around the world and did some translation for some  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  of his meetings and presentations.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  And yeah, it was amazing.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  He's incredible sort of visionary and scientist and understanding how to use microbes.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  If you go back to those days studying under him in the lab, what were some things that  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  you guys were working on that were showing really promising or outstanding results?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  Some of the work that was most exciting at the time was, two subjects really that come  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  to mind.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  One was showing an effect or seeing an effect of increasing the overall diversity index  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  in a system, in a soil or in an agricultural ecosystem.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  And a diversity index is like a way of measuring the amount of diversity and the level of activity  
**[0:05:35-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  of the biology in a system.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  And so we saw very significant, it was like in the chemical system, you have this trend  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  over years, okay, these are long term trends, but in the chemical dominated system, you  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  have this trend of reducing the diversity index over time.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  So you have less diversity, you have less activity of the biology over time.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  And with this tool of EM cultures, we saw back then that you can reverse that trend.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  So you can actually see and measure an increase in the diversity over time.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:34):**  And to me, that's like really, really fundamental with what's happening around the world with  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  the ecosystems.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  So that was, yeah, that was made a big impression.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:48):**  And then the other one was just seeing the nutrient levels.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  So you know, in a plant's growth cycle, it needs certain nutrients at different times,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  like it might need more nitrogen during the vegetative stage, for example.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:11):**  And what we saw was that in the soils that had higher populations and activity of these  
**[0:07:22-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  beneficial microbes that we were adding and that we were measuring with EM practices,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  eventually the plants create some sort of message.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  What we saw was that the microbes would increase, for example, the nitrogen in the rhizosphere  
**[0:07:53-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  around the roots at the time when the plant needed increased nitrogen.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  So we saw a clear communication happening between the plant and the microbial community  
**[0:08:07-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  where they were symbiotic, they were both helping each other in some way.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  And we saw that through NPK levels over the growth cycle in the plant as well as in the  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  soil with different types of treatments.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  So that was really impressive as well.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  To set some terminology straight here, because I know this is where a lot of people get confused.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  EM, what is it?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  So EM technically stands for efficient microbes.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  That's the proper translation from Japanese.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  In Japanese, it's Yu-Yo Bi-Seibutsu, which basically means efficient microorganisms.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  When Dr. Higa's book was translated, it was mistranslated to be effective microbes or  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  microorganisms.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  It's a small nuance, but efficient versus effective is quite different.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  So yeah, efficient microbes is basically this concept of having cultures or using cultures  
**[0:09:30-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:30):**  that have three main groups, the phototrophic bacteria, the yeast, and the lactic acid bacteria.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  Doesn't have only those groups, but those are kind of the three main groups.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  And that's really the concept.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  I mean, Dr. Higa came up with that concept.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  He actually started in the 70s working on it, and he figured out and had kind of the  
**[0:10:01-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  first EM culture in like 80, 81, and started testing that in soils.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  So yeah, EM is efficient microbes, and it's mainly a consortia culture of those groups,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  but not only those groups.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  Now I would also say that there's an organization started by some of Dr. Higa's students,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  a company based in Okinawa called EM Research Organization, and they have since trademarked  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  EM and EM-1 as brands.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  So our company, SCD Probiotics, we don't use EM terminology really anymore.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:00):**  I mean, for me mentally, it's still kind of this concept rather than a specific brand  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  and product from a specific company.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  But yeah, so now EM is more like a brand from a specific company.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  And yeah, but that's sort of the origin of EM terminology.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  If we think about that concept, consortia, can you talk about that?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  Because I think this is where some people get lost.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  They might make a lactobacillus solution and say, well, I know this is trademarked now,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  but they say I've now made EM.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  What are they missing?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  Well they may have made EM.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  I mean, if it's only lactobacillus or lactic acid bacteria, then yeah, it's not EM by definition,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  because it needs to have those different components.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  I mean, I think in the literature, EM is pretty well defined to have those three groups.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  There can be different population levels, different strains, but sort of generically  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:21):**  speaking, if it's got all those groups, then you could call it an EM culture from my point  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  of view.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  A lot of when I do the reading on EM, the consortia concept promises or implies this,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  So if I just add LAB, if I add PNSB and I add yeast to the soil, or I have those minerals  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  acting on their own, they would behave differently if I put them all together in one solution  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  and apply that.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  I think you said it well when you talk about the sum is greater than the individual parts.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  If you just throw the organisms together, mix them up, it doesn't really work.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  It's not that simple.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  There is a culturing process where you, I mean, the way we do it, we actually create  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  a number of different consortia seeds cultures, and then those seed cultures get combined  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  into make a mother culture, but they don't all get combined at once.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  There's different stages of the fermentation and the development of it.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  So I mean, the thing is that I've seen all this do it yourself stuff, including like  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  the methods out of Korea, where you ferment the rice in the woods, in the soil.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  The problem with all those is that they're just inconsistent and there's not really science.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  You've got to have some basic microbiology and measure what's there and its stability,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  including biochemical components.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:31):**  So it's very complex.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  For a user, there are plenty of great cultures where you can just buy a mother culture to  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  do fermentation.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  So personally, I wouldn't recommend trying to recreate the wheel and make your own culture  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:56):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  It's not that simple and you'd have to have pretty sophisticated lab and equipment to  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  be able to have any success with it.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  It's part of the problem in the homades, whether it's the rice wash solution or rice in the  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  forest capturing those microbes is you don't know what you're getting.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  You could be breeding out good with bad.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  Yeah, that is the problem.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  It's not produced using quality control measures according to material specifications.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:40):**  So you don't know what you're getting.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  And actually, similar with compost tea.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  In fact, there's been some problems with compost tea because when you aerate, you can get really  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  nasty microbes, pathogens growing.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:02):**  And with the consortia culture, one of the attributes is the low pH.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  And that low pH really inhibits the undesirable or the disease causing microbes to proliferate.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:22):**  So you're creating an EM solution in an anaerobic environment, lower the pH, and then you take  
**[0:16:34-0:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  that and you add it to an environment that is closer to a neutral pH and aerobic.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:46):**  How does that work at the end of the day?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  So, acidic, acidic, now applied to aerobic, neutral.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  Do they survive?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:59):**  What's happening in that transition?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  Well first of all, a little bit of technical terminology.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  You've got anaerobic and aerobic microbes, but then you've also got facultative anaerobes  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  and facultative anaerobes.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  And the microbes in EM cultures are facultative.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:30):**  So I don't know if I should be more technical on what those mean.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  Okay, well first of all, it's not produced anaerobically.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  It's technically semi-anaerobic.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:41):**  There's still oxygen present.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  And the microbes are not obligate anaerobes.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  Obligate anaerobes means that they are killed by the presence of oxygen.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:57):**  Facultative anaerobes means that the presence of oxygen doesn't kill them.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:02):**  It's just they prefer there not to be oxygen.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  They grow better in the absence of oxygen.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  But they're not killed by oxygen.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  So they're facultative anaerobes.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  Yeah and maybe that clears it up right there.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  The other question about pH is, actually if you add, pH is one measure but then there's  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:35):**  also the acidity and how buffered it is.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  So if you add like an EM culture, like a mother culture, which is let's say a 3.5 pH at a  
**[0:18:55-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  rate of 5%, so 5 parts mother culture and 95 parts neutral water at a 7.0 pH, you'll  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  see the pH of that water come down significantly.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  So maybe as low as 4.0 or 4.5.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:23):**  So yeah.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  But then aren't the microbes used to surviving then at that low pH but now I apply that even  
**[0:19:33-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  diluted down higher pH water solution to my soil and now it's getting diluted down infinitely  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  times more.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  So they're existing now and those microbes are in the water and the soil matrix.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  Are they, if they were used to being in that acidic environment when they're cultured out,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  how are they now surviving in a soil where if you just take a random soil sample it's  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  closer to neutral?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah I see your question.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:06):**  So you mentioned that they prefer the lower pH but that's not actually true.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  The low pH is created by their metabolites, their waste, the cell's waste.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  It's organic acids that lower the pH and when the pH gets low enough different strains of  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  microbes have different tolerance to pH but generally the lower you get the less tolerance  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  there is.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  So low pH will kill some amount of microbes and in particular it happens to kill pathogens  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  more than beneficials which is why you have like the low acid canned food laws where if  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  something is pickled and it's below 4.2 pH it's pretty well preserved.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  It's not going to be harboring pathogens and you can put it on the shelf and eat it six  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  months later and it's fine because of the pH.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  So the FDA has a whole category called low acid canned food which is if the pH is below  
**[0:21:20-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  4.2, I think it's 4.2 pH then it's basically considered preserved and it's fine to have  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  a longer shelf life.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  So it's kind of like with alcohol, making wine, fermenting, the yeast produces alcohol.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  When the alcohol concentration gets high enough it kills the yeast that produced it.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:46):**  Same thing with lactic acid producing bacteria.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:51):**  If that acid gets strong enough and depending on the strain it'll die or it'll reduce in  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  population.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  So the acidic environment is the byproduct of those microbes not the required condition  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  to have those microbes live.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:06):**  Correct.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:07):**  So when you then apply them to a soil they can go on living because they weren't bred  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  to live in that acidic environment.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  Yes, but I also, I view it, you know, not as much about this particular strain is going  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  to go on to live in a certain population in the soil.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  It's more about you're going to stimulate the biology in the soil so you're going to  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  get an increase in beneficial organisms activity.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  So you know it's like in our science and especially the chemical approach which is kind of how  
**[0:22:55-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  we were all raised, it's actually kind of simple because you can break it down into  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  very specific measured components.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  Like the whole chemical industry and all the laws around it are designed for exactness.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  And we run into this importing and exporting microbes and cultures all over the world in  
**[0:23:21-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  our business because the laws were set up to deal with chemicals not complex biology.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  So even when we take that sort of paradigm and apply it to microbiology we like to isolate  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  an organism and study it in the lab and we can see what does it eat and what does it  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:43):**  excrete and you know subject it to different conditions and see what happens which is great  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:49):**  to study that strain.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  But the reality is that nowhere in nature does a strain ever exist in isolation in pure  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  culture.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:59):**  It doesn't exist.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  It's a man-made phenomenon.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  So and turns out when you grow that organism that's isolated in the presence of other  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:11):**  organisms its metabolism is totally different.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  So I'll give you an example.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  Purple non-sulfur bacteria can fix nitrogen out of the air and put it into organic molecules  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  and excrete those molecules.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  If you grow purple non-sulfur bacteria like rhodosudomonas spheroidis in pure culture  
**[0:24:43-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  and measure its production of organic molecules with nitrogen it has a certain rate at which  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  it can do that.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  If you give it the same conditions and you add a lactobacillus culture to it the rate  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  at nitrogen fixation triples.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  It goes a lot faster and that's partially because of what the metabolites that the lactic  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  acid bacteria are producing.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  So my point here is that it's very complex and when you try to break it down in the lab  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:31):**  to really understand it in isolation it no longer represents what you're looking at  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  because that isolated culture doesn't really exist in the real world.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  Well I'm glad you said that because I mean that echoes something that Dr. Paul Zorner  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:49):**  said when I had him on.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:50):**  You put one microbe in the lab and you try and monitor what it does and then you suddenly  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  add other soil microbes with it and you see different results.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  Is this how Dr. Higa came up with that original mother culture?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  Is this what makes it special?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  I think this is really getting at the heart of it.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:09):**  You don't just have three individual things that just would do whatever they do by themselves  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:14):**  in the same bottle.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  You've put them in there and they've been selected to be in there because now you get  
**[0:26:22-0:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:22):**  this circular ring of mutually synergistic behavior where the presence of one enhances  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:32):**  the performance of another and it closes that loop so you end up with something that like  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  you said if you isolated those three out you wouldn't get the same results as if you put  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  them together and that's why that mother culture is so powerful being what it is.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:52):**  Is it the three that are made and thriving to work together?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah and it's not only the three.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  That's maybe something that gets overlooked or misunderstood.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  I'm not going to really go into much detail because it is proprietary but there's more  
**[0:27:19-0:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  than those three and it doesn't start with sterile media.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:30):**  So the EM culture like the mother culture it's a culture starter and it will cause the  
**[0:27:40-0:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  fermentation to go in a certain direction and it will lower the pH and produce these  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  metabolites that are inhibiting disease microbes.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  But it's not inhibiting other microbes that are on the substrates.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  In lactic acid bacteria or phototrophic bacteria, yeast will also be on the substrates so you're  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  going to get some of those wild strains in the culture as well.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:19):**  So you really have a very diverse culture which by definition has to contain certain  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  levels of lactic acid bacteria, yeast and phototrophic bacteria but not only those.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  It's not only those.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:35):**  I love what you're saying and now I'm thinking okay I'm a grower, I'm a farmer listening  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  to this.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  I want to add EM to my soil but I also have all this local microbes in my soil whether  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:47):**  I'm in California, New York, Kansas or Florida.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  What is EM going to do to what I have locally?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  Yeah I think of it as a stimulant.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  It's going to stimulate the beneficials in that system and those beneficials, that biology  
**[0:29:08-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  in the system, when it gets stimulated it's going to produce more good stuff that the  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  plants need including plant hormones, chelated minerals, plant available nutrients.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:25):**  It's also going to be pushing out those undesirable microbes which they're undesirable because  
**[0:29:37-0:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  their metabolites, what they excrete are oxidative or toxic to plant cells and that's why they're  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  pathogens or that's why they're undesirable is because what they produce hurts the plants.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  Whereas beneficials, the way I define it, a beneficial excretes building blocks of healthy  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  cells in plants or animals.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  So vitamins, antioxidants, organic acids, healthy building blocks for cells.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  So yeah I think of it more as a stimulant to the system but I also recognize that, and  
**[0:30:25-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  this may go back to what you said earlier about why it hasn't been adopted widely.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  And that is that it does take time and it takes a consistent approach whereas our mentality  
**[0:30:44-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  is like we apply the chemical and we see the result within days or weeks.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  This is stimulating the biology in a very complex system over time, it takes time.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  But what you can see over time is a shifting of some of those parameters that you can measure  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  which relate back to the health of the system.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  So Dr. Higa and Dr. Parr who was with the USDA wrote an article about classifying soils  
**[0:31:33-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  based on what microbes were dominant in the system and there's basically four classes.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  Like one type of soil which is very commonly associated with heavy chemical use over decades  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  of using chemicals, pesticides is what's called a disease inducing soil.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  So a disease inducing soil if you look at kind of broadly what kind of microbes dominate  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:04):**  in that system, there's a lot of pathogens.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  So if you don't use the pesticides to keep the pathogen levels down, there's a lot of  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  disease in your crop.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  That's a disease inducing soil.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  On the other spectrum there's a zymogenic soil and that's a soil that is like high levels  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  of beneficial microbes producing all the nutrients for healthy plants, maximizing what the plant  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:33):**  needs and low incidence of disease causing microbes.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:39):**  So there's two classes in the middle but what you can do is you can move a soil to that  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  zymogenic state and that's what you want to be at because in the zymogenic state you need  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  less fertilizer and less pesticides and you get healthier and more productive plants.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  Terms of a long term approach like, I'm with you, when people hear long term, if somebody  
**[0:33:04-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  was to go down the EM path, mother culture path and apply this to a soil, to see long  
**[0:33:14-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  term significant meaningful change, is this a year's approach?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  It is generally speaking a multi-year approach but you can see results within the first year  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  depending on what kind of system you're dealing with.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  That's another challenge.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  You've got different climates, different soils, different crops, different management practices,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  maybe with pesticides or without.  
**[0:33:51-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  Most are with pesticides if it's conventional farming.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  But you can definitely see results in one cycle but you're not going to see maximum  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:09):**  results in one cycle.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  Now I will say though that our approach at SCD Probiotics, we've developed applications  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  that are more like the chemical approach.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  So basically biochemical products from fermentation that act like chemicals.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  So I'll give you an example.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  In herbicide applications, all herbicides get applied with an adjuvant, typically a  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  non-ion extrafactant.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  A non-ion extrafactant is a petroleum based petrochemical that reduces the surface tension  
**[0:34:59-0:35:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:59):**  of water and helps penetration of the active ingredient like glyphosate for example.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:10):**  We came out with a product called ProBioAct which is fermentation based from all food  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  grade materials and organic materials with probiotics and that is used to replace the  
**[0:35:29-0:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  non-ion extrafactant component of the herbicide.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:36):**  We're kind of talking about the basic stuff that we did 10-15 years ago but now we've  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  taken the technology, I mean the number of applications and products and mother cultures  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:47):**  and biochemical byproducts that we have now based on this technology platform is over  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  a hundred different products.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:57):**  We break our business into three different segments.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:01):**  One is industrial, another is agriculture and then the third is consumer products.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:07):**  And so just to give you kind of an idea, in the industrial segment we're replacing petrochemicals  
**[0:36:14-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  with biobased biochemicals from fermentation in textile manufacture, leather manufacture,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  paper manufacture as an example.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  And our goal is to basically replace petrochemicals with biobased materials that are less toxic  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  and have a better environmental footprint, less carbon footprint.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  So that's our industrial segment.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  And then our consumer segment is like we've got dietary supplements which are basically  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:46):**  probiotics but consortia based probiotics.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  Your typical probiotic is like a pure culture probiotic that if it has multiple species  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  they were blended at packaging, those organisms have never lived in the presence of other  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  organisms so it's that pure culture approach.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  But we also have come out with probiotic cleaning products.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  Of course we've got lawn care, lawn and garden products.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  So all based on this fermentation and where I started which is this EM culturing technology  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  of consortia culturing with phototrophic bacteria and yeast and lactic acid bacteria.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  And then in agriculture we've got kind of your typical, we've got the bio ag mother  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  culture which is a mother culture for making an activation for sort of general on-farm  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  use.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  And we have quite a few farmers that do that on a very large scale.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  They buy mother culture from us, we send it to them in a one ton IBC liquid tank and then  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:00):**  they use that to, it's called activation or basically to make a fermentation and multiply  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  it 20 times in volume.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  And then that becomes their concentrate which they use for on-farm applications.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  But we also have this line of basically biochemical products which are in ag applications designed  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  to replace the pesticides and the petrochemicals.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  So the ones that are the mother cultures, one thing I think people miss on this is they  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  say oh it's expensive.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:39):**  But you could buy a gallon of it, culture it out, what like 20 times and it comes down  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  to cents per application.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:48):**  Can you talk a little bit about that because that's a key point I think a lot of people  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:51):**  miss.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, so you said it.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  I mean a mother culture, it can be used directly but if you want to do it economically then  
**[0:39:08-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  you can do one part of mother culture with one part molasses and 20 parts water and do  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:17):**  a fermentation that's fairly simple but also very predictable what kind of results you'll  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  get.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  And you know it, yeah so like if you buy a liter for $30 of mother culture and then you  
**[0:39:38-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  can turn it into 20 liters of mother culture then it means that it costs you $1.50 per  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  liter of finished product.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  Right and I'm looking at your page here so for somebody in ag or gardening SCD, the bio  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  ag would be the product you'd recommend people start with?  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:01):**  Yes.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  And what's a typical...  
**[0:40:03-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  I also recommend the kitchen composter or the Bokashi composter because that's a really  
**[0:40:16-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  easy way to recycle your food waste into your garden and you know it's pretty convenient  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  and it also kind of introduces people to fermentation which that's one of the things where like  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  going back to sort of the roots of this with Dr. Higa, he in Okinawa, Japan and Japan in  
**[0:40:43-0:40:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  general and Korea as well there's this actually all over the world in certain ways there's  
**[0:40:53-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:53):**  this practice of fermentation for food right?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  Miso, kimchi, cheese, yogurt, sauerkraut and the thing that Dr. Higa observed in Japan  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  they also do fermentation to feed the soil.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:19):**  There's some techniques and traditions where it's fermentation not just to feed your family  
**[0:41:26-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  or to feed your livestock but to also feed the soil and to grow plants and so you know  
**[0:41:34-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  he started looking at that but from the traditional approach like farmers who had been doing fermentation  
**[0:41:43-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  for hundreds of years to feed their soil no microbiology just the practice and the tradition  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52):**  those cultures though being passed down because those fermentation and those cultures are  
**[0:41:59-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  maintained so you know he started looking at that as because he was in search of an  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  alternative to the chemical approach because he saw the side effects and the toxicity that  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:13):**  can come from the chemicals and so he was looking for a way to use nature to reduce  
**[0:42:20-0:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  the chemicals and that you know what we do in our business is really true to that today  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  I mean we've brought that concept and applied science and applied you know millions of dollars  
**[0:42:35-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:35):**  and you know research and development to but starting with that concept of these consortia  
**[0:42:44-0:42:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  fermentation cultures you know can create all kinds of useful beneficial products both  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:53):**  biochemical as well as live microbial or biological.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  What are your thoughts on using these products as foliar feeds?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  Is there any benefit to that or is it all straight to soil?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  No I think definitely foliar feeds is an important application there's a lot going on on the  
**[0:43:19-0:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:19):**  phyelosphere of plants there's definitely a microbial community there and so you know  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:28):**  what you don't want is pathogens dominating on the phyelosphere of plants you get disease  
**[0:43:35-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  and stress to the plant from those pathogens so having beneficial microbes and their metabolites  
**[0:43:44-0:43:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  on the surfaces of plants is one benefit from a foliar feed and you know I'm not really  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:55):**  up to speed on the science of how much nutrients are absorbed through the phyelosphere but  
**[0:44:00-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  I think it's still it's material or significant so yeah I definitely would recommend foliar  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  feeds.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:11):**  One thing you talked about is beneficial microbes push out pathogenic microbes is that by push  
**[0:44:19-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  out does that mean out compete prey upon or alter conditions so pathogenic microbes can't  
**[0:44:32-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:32):**  survive or all the above?  
**[0:44:35-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  It's all the above I mean I have to be careful and make the disclaimer that you know we're  
**[0:44:43-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  not making pesticide claims with our products and according to the EPA if you make a claim  
**[0:44:53-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  that you affect the metabolism of another organism then by definition it's a pesticide  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  so claims about competitive exclusion can't really be made with a product unless you're  
**[0:45:08-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  going to get a pesticide registration but the concept of competitive exclusion is basically  
**[0:45:16-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  that within a system okay whether it's a soil or it's the rhizosphere or the phyelosphere  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  or the surface of the countertop surface in your home or the surface of your skin there's  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:31):**  in ecological terms there's what's known as a niche and a carrying capacity and it's  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  basically means that within a defined space or niche there's a certain amount of life  
**[0:45:44-0:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:44):**  that will be there that will be supported by that by space by air by moisture other  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  types of nutrient compounds are there and you know a microbial cell doesn't need a lot  
**[0:46:00-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  it can sit there dormant doing nothing for you know years actually so everything's got  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  this niche and this carrying capacity now if you put certain microbes there on a regular  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  basis you're going to influence which microbes are living there because it can only support  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:19):**  so many microbes so let's say a particular niche can support a hundred cells of microbes  
**[0:46:27-0:46:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:27):**  well if you put 90 cells there that are these beneficials then there's only space for 10  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  cells of pathogens just using a simple example  
**[0:46:39-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  when I apply a mother culture like the bioag or something a lot of the worry that people  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  have is I'm going to pour it on and like I don't know if it's going to live or die what  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  can you say to give me some cause to relax on that you know because I think the worry  
**[0:47:03-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:03):**  is I'm going to apply it but there's already like local micro microbiome there that's thriving  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  and it could be like you know I'm dropping these new guys in and they're just like nope  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:16):**  not coming in here not setting up shop like we're dominating and then you just poured  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:20):**  it on and they like it best become food for other microbes what are your thoughts on that  
**[0:47:27-0:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:27):**  I mean you know the best thing is to measure the quality you know what what qualities are  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:36):**  you measuring or what what qualities of the system are you observing or measuring and  
**[0:47:44-0:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  those are where you should look to see the benefits of using these types of cultures  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:50):**  so if you're if you're seeing what you should expect to see is changes in the the physical  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:57):**  structure of the soil improvements in the cation exchange capacity of the soil decreases  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:04):**  in undesirable microbes increases in beneficial microbes all those are all things that you  
**[0:48:10-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:10):**  can see I mean that you can measure but you really see it in in the in the health of your  
**[0:48:16-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  crop or maybe in the health of the soil that you can observe it so it kind of doesn't matter  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:23):**  whether it's it's happening because the microbes survived or because they fed something or  
**[0:48:29-0:48:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:29):**  some metabolite stimulated the system it really doesn't matter if you're getting the benefits  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:38):**  that you can measure and see in terms of productivity yield that type of thing one thing I do want  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  to make sure we cover in this is if we look at the three main groups and I know you've  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  emphasized there's more than three but if we look at the three main kind of by definition  
**[0:48:55-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  groups in that mother culture let's go through them so we have lactobacillus phototrophic  
**[0:49:03-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  bacteria in yeast can you talk about each one specifically and its role in the soil  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  so if I just had lactobacillus to the soil what is that doing for the soil and the plants  
**[0:49:18-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  in that soil and then just just going down the list  
**[0:49:28-0:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  well each all three of them produce different types of substances that are beneficial to  
**[0:49:35-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:35):**  plants like plant hormones or plant available nutrients or they produce substances metabolites  
**[0:49:46-0:49:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  that interact with the nutrients in the soil to make them plant available and then they  
**[0:49:57-0:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:57):**  don't produce things that stress the plants which is what pathogens do produce so you  
**[0:50:08-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  know they each have different types of things they produce in those broad categories like  
**[0:50:15-0:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  phototrophic bacteria produce antioxidants and they they also can engage the nitrogen  
**[0:50:22-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:22):**  cycle they can fix nitrogen out of the air for example lactic acid bacteria produce organic  
**[0:50:35-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  acids which have a have a benefit for the area around the rhizosphere yeast produce  
**[0:50:47-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  vitamins and chelating materials so you know they but it may not be that those are those  
**[0:51:04-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  those things they produce are being directly absorbed by the plant it could be that they're  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  stimulating that biology so the overall activity increases but increases in a certain way that's  
**[0:51:20-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  beneficial rather than you know not rather than pathogens that are producing stress compounds  
**[0:51:29-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  would that be the case for adding a mother culture to a traditional compost pile lactobacillus  
**[0:51:38-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:38):**  isn't going to break down lignin in wood but it might produce byproducts that feed the  
**[0:51:46-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  fungi that break down the wood yeah exactly we we do a lot of composting inoculants and  
**[0:51:57-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  projects and you know yes one is accelerating the process it absolutely you know you can  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  measure the acceleration of the process making it more uniform so that you're getting a more  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:10):**  consistent finished product which is important important in commercial composting where the  
**[0:52:15-0:52:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  end products being used for fertilizer one of the so the beneficial microbes going in  
**[0:52:30-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:30):**  a fermentative or regenerative pathway versus putrefactive pathway so disease microbes are  
**[0:52:46-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:46):**  defined as disease microbes because they secrete or they excrete metabolites that are stressful  
**[0:52:54-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  to plants and animals that oxidize the cells and damage the plant so it it just so happens  
**[0:53:06-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  that those those types of organisms also produce foul smells a lot of those metabolites are  
**[0:53:15-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  odor compounds so it's like we have god-given built into us the ability to tell if something  
**[0:53:24-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  is bad because it's putrefied and it smells bad if you grow e.coli in the lab for example  
**[0:53:32-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  you know it it stinks okay so with with the regenerative pathway the beneficial microbes  
**[0:53:41-0:53:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:41):**  it it doesn't stink it it's it's more of a sweet fermented smell a pickling smell and  
**[0:53:50-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:50):**  it doesn't linger and it doesn't go long distances it it's there but it kind of goes away whereas  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  a stinky one like if you go to a place where there's high levels of foul odor compounds  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:03):**  in the air like maybe on a livestock barn or a wastewater treatment sludge handling  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  plant like that stuff sticks to your clothes like you leave that place and you gotta you  
**[0:54:15-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  gotta change because it it still smells um so you know that that's just so in composting  
**[0:54:27-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  odor control we have some clients that are like doing large-scale composting near urban  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  areas and they can't have a foul odor they'll get shut down so they use our product not  
**[0:54:42-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:42):**  only for accelerating the process but also for controlling odors and the odor control  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  is done effectively like if we look at the microbial side it's just eliminating those  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  or lessening the putrefying organisms that would create the odor to begin with that and  
**[0:55:02-0:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  and there's also um there's a there's a chemical effect so you know one one effect for odor  
**[0:55:09-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  control is displacing the microbes that create odors another is odor compounds that already  
**[0:55:17-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  exist and neutralizing them instantaneously chemically you know one is a biological process  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  that can happen over time the other is a an immediate chemical reaction which is neutralizing  
**[0:55:30-0:55:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:30):**  an odor compound okay thinking ahead somebody goes down a program of regenerative ag and  
**[0:55:42-0:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:42):**  really changes their microbial makeup in their soil for the better through a product like  
**[0:55:51-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:51):**  yours and just good agricultural practices is there a way that you see that someone and  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  really that i think this is how the community ultimately benefits at the end of the day  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  if this is possible where i could take some of my healthy soil and culture that out use  
**[0:56:12-0:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  that to seed microbiology in another part of the farm at the neighbor's farm because  
**[0:56:20-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  eventually like i'm just thinking i i apply your stuff and it's great that i'm buying  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  this consortia from you but a lot of the benefit i'm getting is local to me because that consortia  
**[0:56:33-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  is stimulating what i have is there a way for me to now share this built up microbial  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  base  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  historically yes i don't know that it's the cost benefit is there you know to to do it  
**[0:56:53-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:53):**  that way um and there's also risks because you're not you're not eliminating pathogens  
**[0:57:03-0:57:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  in your system like there's still pathogens in the in in your soil in fact one of the  
**[0:57:10-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:10):**  things that dr jiga used to say in like microbiology 101 class was it's not the presence of a pathogen  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  that causes a problem it's it's the high population of the pathogen and in fact pathogens in low  
**[0:57:26-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  population are actually beneficial because they stimulate the immune response so you  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  don't actually want to get rid of all the pathogens you want there to be low levels  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:41):**  of pathogens because that actually stimulates the immune response you don't want you don't  
**[0:57:46-0:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:46):**  want those populations to get so high that you get the symptoms of disease that's that  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:53):**  that means there's an imbalance and this organism is is too high so when with that understanding  
**[0:57:59-0:58:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  if you take that to culturing your soil or your compost or you know those practices there's  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:07):**  some risk that you you you end up growing and proliferating something that you don't  
**[0:58:12-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:12):**  want to um unless you have you know some sophisticated microbiology lab capabilities but um you know  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  i i feel like that's really what like the value proposition for our business with mother  
**[0:58:31-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  cultures is that we provide a reasonably priced product that is consistent and quality controlled  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:41):**  and you know when you use it to to to start a fermentation you're going to get consistent  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  results you're going to get a the the production of those beneficial microbes and their metabolites  
**[0:58:53-0:59:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:53):**  and yeah can you do it on your own like you're saying theoretically i probably probably but  
**[0:59:02-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:02):**  you know i i don't know that that's really practical is there an overboard can i like  
**[0:59:08-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:08):**  say i'm on a farm that requires 100 irrigation where and every time i irrigate some of that  
**[0:59:16-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  mother culture is going out in the line could that be a problem no i mean it's it's self-limiting  
**[0:59:28-0:59:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:28):**  i mean yes too much of a good thing is a bad thing right you you can you can like for example  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:36):**  a plant that's highly sensitive to ph if you poured mother culture straight on its roots  
**[0:59:41-0:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  you you you would probably damage it because of the acidity but but those are all not really  
**[0:59:47-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:47):**  practical situations like a farmer or a gardener they don't want to use too much like why why  
**[0:59:56-1:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:56):**  why put it on straight why overdo it you know um so yeah i mean i i i believe in too much  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  of a good thing is a bad thing concept but from a practical point of view there you know  
**[1:00:11-1:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  we never see it we never see like oh i added too much and therefore you know i have a damage  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:16):**  in the system it's somewhat limiting again because of that niche and carrying capacity  
**[1:00:21-1:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  concept um you know if you use too much then yeah it's more will die off and you won't  
**[1:00:31-1:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:31):**  get the benefit of having used double the amount for example so just to sum this all  
**[1:00:36-1:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:36):**  up i mean is the is the whole gist here really we're in a world that's became microbially  
**[1:00:43-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:43):**  depleted and using a mother culture like the one you produce is one tool to help reseed  
**[1:00:55-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  and repopulate microbes in these depressed microbial populations around the world yes  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  i would say it's slightly differently in that i wouldn't say we're in a microbially depleted  
**[1:01:12-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  world i'd say that a lot of you know this is a very general statement first of all right  
**[1:01:20-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  um but a lot of a lot of this ecosystems especially farming systems are they're stressed or they're  
**[1:01:28-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  depleted or they're they're worn out or they have high chemical residues built up um and  
**[1:01:38-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  using a mother culture using a product like ours um it stimulates the beneficial ecology  
**[1:01:47-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  of that system so it's i see it more of as a stimulate stimulant rather than um like  
**[1:01:55-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  a microbial inoculant.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  Thank you.

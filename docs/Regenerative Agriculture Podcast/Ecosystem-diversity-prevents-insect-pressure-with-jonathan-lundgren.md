**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:00):**  The question that I always ask farmers that come up to visit is how often can you lose  
**[0:00:05-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:05):**  a crop and make more money than the neighbors do?  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:11):**  The answer is every single time when you're farming regeneratively.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:15):**  Hi friends, I'm John Kempf, hosting this podcast.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:19):**  I'm passionate about developing regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:25):**  produce crops that are completely resistant to diseases and insects, and produce fruit  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:29):**  of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate conversation about growing  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:34):**  food as medicine.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:35):**  There are many people with incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:41):**  and how to develop regenerative agriculture systems.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:44):**  However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:47):**  It's found all over the place.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:49):**  Some of it has been published in peer reviewed publications, but there are many incredible  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:54):**  stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published and that hasn't been shared  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:58):**  with many people.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:00:59):**  I started advancing eco agriculture in 2006 to bring this knowledge together in a more  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:06):**  coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems that growers can easily  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:11):**  put into practice.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:13):**  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:18):**  and become the mainstream, the status quo against which all other growing systems are  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:23):**  compared.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:24):**  To help achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge that we have learned in the  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:28):**  last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:32):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:36):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:41):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:43):**  When they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and resilience  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:01:48):**  to climate stress.

**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:17):**  Words and phrases are powerful.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:19):**  Think about the phrase food allergies.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:21):**  Why have we come to accept as normal that people should be allergic to food?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:25):**  In this episode, Jonathan Lundgren brings a similar phrase to mind, food safety.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:31):**  Jonathan brings an interesting perspective as a professional evaluator of pesticides  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:35):**  and genetically modified organisms in agriculture ecosystems.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:38):**  We talk about how we have the potential and the capacity to develop agriculture ecosystems  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:44):**  that are incredibly resilient and can produce crops that are completely resistant to insect  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:49):**  pests that are present in the field.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:52):**  I'm here with an agroecologist, entomologist, very respected researcher and someone whose  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:02:57):**  work I have been reading and following for some time.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:00):**  I'm very honored to have him here, Jonathan Lundgren.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:03):**  Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.

**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:05):**  Well, thanks for having me.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:06):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:08):**  Jonathan, you've done some very interesting work looking at agroecology and the ecological  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:16):**  implications of pest management strategies and some of the tools that we use today.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:20):**  You've had a really interesting journey.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:22):**  What are some of the memorable moments that led you to the spot where you are today?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:25):**  Can you tell us a little bit about your journey and your pathway?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:29):**  I was trained as an entomologist and a lot of times scientists are trained to focus in  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:36):**  their study area and within their particular group to specialize.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:41):**  I was no exception.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:43):**  I'm a predator ecologist, I guess, and I really like lady beetles, so ladybugs, as good predators  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:52):**  and we would study those.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:03:53):**  But the deeper that I dug into those, that organismal level, I started to ask questions  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:01):**  that couldn't be answered at an organismal level.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:05):**  That forced me to start to expand my thinking about the research that I was focusing on  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:11):**  and including more of a community approach.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:16):**  And then the more I focused on insect communities, the more I realized that in order to answer  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:20):**  some of the questions that we needed to be addressing, it required that I not just think  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:26):**  about entomology anymore and start learning more about the agroecosystem in general.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:33):**  I still study insects an awful lot, but I realize now that they're a good learning tool  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:41):**  for telling us about the greater system rather than being an entity in and of themselves  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:46):**  or isolated.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:49):**  When you speak of insects as being an indicator of a greater system, what are they telling  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:55):**  you?  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:56):**  What have you observed that surprised you?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:04:58):**  One major change in my thinking that kind of gets at your question is realizing that  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:03):**  I can't be focusing on one particular group of insects.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:06):**  We all want a dipstick to tell us whether our practices in soil health are working.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:13):**  What I came to understand the more we researched this topic is that insect communities were  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:20):**  an entity that we needed to be focusing on rather than individual indicators.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:26):**  insect communities were so dynamic and they changed pretty dramatically, but at the same  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:32):**  time all of those changes were really representing key niches.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:38):**  The diversification of that community allows that community to function as we change the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:44):**  habitat or the farmland, so that there's always somebody sitting in each piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:51):**  That's where biodiversity really comes into play.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:05:55):**  That was what was so surprising, just how important biodiversity within our agroecosystems  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:01):**  really is.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:02):**  We need life in all of its forms, don't we?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:06):**  That we do.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:07):**  What did you observe that really drove this point home for you?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:10):**  We started at bio inventory cornfield.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:13):**  A lot of the work that I did when I first started with the USDA, I began my career as  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:19):**  a scientist with the USDA.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:20):**  I swore that I wasn't going to work on corn because a lot of entomologists worked on corn  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:25):**  at the laboratory that I was working on.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:29):**  It was always this crop that I was like, oh geez, I want to work on something different.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:35):**  But the more I dug into it, I look back at a career of 20 years in entomology and in  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:41):**  ecology now and it's like, God, a lot of that was working in corn.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:47):**  Corn has been the system that really opened my eyes to the importance of diversity.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:06:53):**  What happened was that we kind of landed this little grant to study communities in corn,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:01):**  like insect communities and how landscapes affect those communities and the resilience  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:07):**  of those communities to invasive species in cornfield.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:11):**  One thing led to another.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:12):**  We led this whole team.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:14):**  Part of it was entomologists and then the other half was economists from all over the  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:19):**  world.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:21):**  My colleague in the project was an economist.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:24):**  We went out and we surveyed these 53 cornfields all over eastern South Dakota.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:29):**  Every cornfield, we applied the same method and we looked at all of the species that were  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:34):**  living on corn plants, all of the insect species.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:38):**  We collected them up and then we brought them back to the lab.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:42):**  That was a huge monumental effort.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:44):**  This was a lot of work.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:46):**  It ended up identifying, by the end, probably hundreds of thousands of insect specimens  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:52):**  down to species level.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:54):**  Tons of work.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:07:56):**  The more I dug into it, the more it opened my eyes to the fact that this has really never  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:01):**  been done before.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:04):**  Entomologists always just focus on the past and maybe a couple of key natural enemies  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:07):**  of the past.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:08):**  But we never really looked at the actual community in itself in all of its glory, right?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:14):**  Because it is.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:15):**  It's so much work to get this data.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:18):**  But we did it.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:19):**  And in looking at the data, the patterns in the data became so clear that when we had  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:25):**  more insect species within a cornfield, there just wasn't pests.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:32):**  We did not have pest problems anymore.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:34):**  And at the same time, there was a couple of other papers that were starting to come out  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:38):**  that were suggesting that this diversity was, or lack of diversity, was really important  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:42):**  in creating pest problems.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:45):**  And then I look at the system and how we produce our crops right now.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:49):**  If diversity is what we're after, then man, our production prices are just absolutely  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:08:59):**  perfect for creating pest outbreaks.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:02):**  Yeah, I can completely relate with your desire to not work with corn because it's a dominant  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:08):**  crop.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:09):**  It's well studied to some degree.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:10):**  And it's a relatively simplistic crop compared to growing, say, tomatoes or peaches or nectarines.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:17):**  But to your last comment, it's such a dominant crop in such a broad region throughout the  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:23):**  Midwest.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:24):**  I mean, in the state of Iowa, any crop that is not corn or soybean is considered a specialty  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:29):**  crop.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:30):**  Alfalfa hay is a specialty crop, as are oats and everything else.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:33):**  Isn't that amazing?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:38):**  I can justify working on it in my own mind by just saying, well, if we can make changes  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:43):**  to corn, think of the footprint geographically that we would have in terms of changing landscapes  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:49):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:50):**  On our own farm, I don't grow corn.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:09:54):**  And I don't advise people to grow corn either.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:00):**  The reality is that for many growers today, it makes very good economic sense to grow  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:03):**  crops other than corn.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:05):**  That's another conversation.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:08):**  You mentioned that when you had increased insect diversity and a diverse population  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:14):**  of insects, you had no pest pressure.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:17):**  What do you believe the mechanisms are for producing that shift?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:20):**  We've known that putting up more plant species into a habitat tends to result in fewer pests.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:27):**  And there's two general hypotheses for what drives this.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:30):**  And they are the natural enemies hypothesis, which says that as you increase plants, you  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:36):**  increase the number of predators of pest species.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:39):**  And so that predation ends up being a downward pressure on the pest populations.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:45):**  And then the other idea, resource concentration theory, which is by including more plant diversity  
**[0:10:49-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:49):**  into a system, that you are diluting your focal crop within the vegetation community.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:10:57):**  And so maybe it's more difficult for the pests to find or it changes the plant in some way.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:03):**  I think both of those are probably at play within that study that showed that insect  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:08):**  diversity was really important.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:10):**  But I think that it's so much more complicated than that.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:14):**  Scientists are just like everybody else in that we like to categorize things and we like  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:20):**  to control them and we like to manipulate them and feel like we have, at the end of  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:26):**  it, some intimate knowledge of what's going on.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:29):**  But the reality is within an ecological system, and I've been working in it for a long time,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:36):**  the complexity becomes so staggering that I don't think that we can understand all of  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:44):**  the mechanisms that are driving this.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:47):**  And that's a humbling experience for a scientist to have to admit that at some level we just  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:53):**  have to get the hell out of the way and observe these systems rather than going out to our  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:11:58):**  research farm and picking out every mechanism that we can think of as the quote unquote  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:04):**  experts.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:06):**  What I ended up doing that was really important in my career and in us coming to these conclusions  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:13):**  is I just started to go out to the farmers that were leading this regenerative agriculture  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:17):**  movement and looked at what they were doing.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:20):**  I wasn't interested in controlling their farm.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:23):**  I just wanted to observe.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:26):**  And that's the way science used to happen, isn't it?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:29):**  Scientists would go out and they would observe the natural world and they would use that  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:34):**  as the basis of developing hypotheses that then they could test.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:39):**  And nowadays science has totally shifted, right?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:42):**  Nowadays the scientific expert who's got their PhD and all of the pieces of paper that says  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:49):**  that they're really bright, they sit down behind their computer and they write the sexiest  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:54):**  grant proposal that they possibly can.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:12:57):**  And there's a total disconnect more often than not between the science that ends up  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:02):**  happening and the real world that ultimately farmers are living in.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:08):**  And so it's been a real challenge for us to innovate our food production system using  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:13):**  science.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:14):**  It's a challenge for some growers as well.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:16):**  There are certainly some growers who are exceptional at being observant and seeing what is happening.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:23):**  Many farmers are very connected to their farm and what's happening around them in the natural  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:26):**  environment.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:27):**  There is an incredible complexity.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:29):**  It's beyond the capacity of most of us or perhaps any of us to comprehend all the interactions  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:37):**  that are happening inside of a plant and with all of these various organism communications  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:42):**  back and forth by whatever mechanism and by whatever means.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:46):**  But the beauty, the beauty within all of that complexity and we can take comfort in the  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:51):**  fact that it was designed to work.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:54):**  It's been developed to work.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:13:55):**  It works extremely harmoniously to the point that you made earlier is that in many cases  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:00):**  perhaps we just simply need to get out of the way and allow it to function as it was  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:04):**  intended to.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:05):**  To me, it's humbling and it's also so exciting because when we kind of release that and we  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:13):**  just start appreciating the beauty and that sense of wonder at the natural world, my God,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:21):**  what an invigorating thing, you know.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:24):**  It is indeed.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:27):**  Earlier in our conversation, you mentioned the ecological implications of pest management  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:34):**  and some of the tools that we use today.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:36):**  I'd love to hear a bit more about that.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:39):**  What are the impacts on our agriculture ecosystems of the pest management tools that we're so  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:45):**  widely using today and how can we, what are possible alternatives?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:50):**  What can we do better?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:51):**  Right.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:52):**  My research focuses on two general areas.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:14:55):**  One is risk assessment of pesticides and genetically modified crops and basically farm management  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:02):**  practices in general.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:03):**  And then the other half is working on developing sustainable systems.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:07):**  So I've got quite a bit of experience in understanding the ecological risk assessment and the framework  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:15):**  that we use for trying to determine whether a particular agrochemical or something is  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:21):**  safe or not safe.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:24):**  I've advised the U.S. EPA, I've been on advisory panels for the European version of the EPA,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:33):**  Brazilian government, the United Nations and their conference on biodiversity.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:39):**  After 20 years of studying this, I can honestly say that when you look at the side of a jug  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:47):**  and it says that it's safe, that is meaningless.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:15:52):**  You can go out and you can buy something off of a shelf and it's labeled and it's regulated.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:00):**  Nobody is watching.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:04):**  Nobody is watching.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:06):**  Risk assessment is incredibly hard.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:09):**  It's incredibly hard.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:11):**  We can get closer to the mark with scientific approaches to risk assessment.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:17):**  But again, when you understand the complexity of the natural world, I mean, my God, right  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:23):**  now just for pesticides, there are a couple hundred different pesticides where the active  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:30):**  ingredient is registered with the EPA.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:33):**  And that's where most of the assessments are, or the safety assessments are focused, is  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:39):**  on those active ingredients.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:42):**  But whenever you add an adjuvant, maybe it's a sticker or a spreader or a de-foaming agent  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:49):**  or whatever, it changes the toxicology of that active ingredient such that the risk  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:16:57):**  assessment that you're actually performing on that active ingredient really does not  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:02):**  hold much weight anymore.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:03):**  And when you think about all of the formulated products, there's 20,000 formulated pesticides  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:12):**  in the US and each of those pesticides would require an ecological risk assessment independent.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:19):**  Each of them.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:20):**  Where's the budget for that?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:23):**  And in addition to that, farmers will in many cases add additional adjuvants or spreader,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:28):**  stickers or whatever the case might be in the spray tank in addition to whatever's in  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:32):**  the jug.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:33):**  That's right.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:34):**  And it changes everything.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:35):**  I'm not saying that we shouldn't have, you know, agrochemical, be they herbicides, be  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:42):**  they fungicides, be they insecticides.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:44):**  I understand the utility of these things, but I think that we need to have a hell of  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:49):**  a lot more respect than we do right now.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:51):**  The counties, my county in particular, should not be using a fire hose to be spraying the  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:17:57):**  weeds on the road margins to kill fissiles that may or may not be there.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:02):**  You know, just to burn up product.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:04):**  Come on.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:05):**  I think that farmers, when they buy a bag of seed and the seed is in the natural color,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:11):**  it's either purple or blue or pink, those are neurotoxins that they're putting onto  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:16):**  their field and very little of that is actually getting into the plant.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:21):**  Most of it is getting into your soil.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:25):**  And so when we start to think about what causes a pest, and if it's a reduction in biodiversity,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:32):**  almost instantly when you buy a jug, you are counteracting nature's ability to fight that  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:40):**  pest.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:41):**  You are causing pest problems.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:44):**  That then you have to buy another jug in order to control.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:49):**  And it's this wicked treadmill that just keeps spiraling.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:54):**  So a couple of thoughts that emerge from what you've just shared.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:18:58):**  The first one is when you say that nobody is watching, what are the ecological implications  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:03):**  of that?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:04):**  What I'm hearing you to some degree, Day, is that we don't even understand the implications  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:10):**  that these materials might have on soil health and ecosystem health.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:16):**  We don't have the first inkling of what the implications of these things, be it glyphosate,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:21):**  be it neonicotinoids, be it propiconazole, or be it the adjuvants, which sometimes are  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:27):**  more toxic than the active ingredient in terms of its ecological effects.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:32):**  And we're not just talking about the soil, right?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:34):**  We're talking about human health problems.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:37):**  Farmers have the highest suicide rate of any career at this point in the US.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:42):**  And we know that pesticide use is linked with depression.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:47):**  The science has been done on that.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:48):**  I mean, are we killing ourselves?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:53):**  Many of these agrochemicals, in my understanding, are also very exceptionally potent endocrine  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:19:59):**  disruptors.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:01):**  And estrogen stimulants.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:03):**  And they affect us and the natural world in many ways.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:08):**  The moment you begin talking about endocrine disruption, I mean, that shapes who we are  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:14):**  and our personality and our thought patterns in ways I think we don't fully aware of.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:20):**  But when you think about the cancer profile and cancers of various organs in the endocrine  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:29):**  system or the reproductive system and the way that that has shifted, not just among  
**[0:20:34-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:34):**  farmers, but in general population, it leads me to ask the question 40, 50 years ago, perhaps  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:42):**  60 years ago, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer, prostate  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:49):**  cancer, et cetera, all these that are connected to the endocrine system and the reproductive  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:53):**  system were relatively small proportion of cancers.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:56):**  They were single digit percentage points.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:20:59):**  Today they're a majority when taken in aggregate.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:06):**  So will we ever determine whether pesticides are the cause of that?  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:09):**  I don't know.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:10):**  I mean, definitively the cause of it.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:13):**  I don't know.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:14):**  I think there's evidence that would support that, the carcinogenicity of various agrochemicals.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:21):**  Do we know that that's, is that all?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:23):**  I don't know that would cause these patterns that we're starting to see within our society.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:29):**  I'm not sure, but boy, my eyes and ears are wide open and if I can get away on my own  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:37):**  farm without that stuff, then I'm going to do my darndest to do that.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:43):**  And I think that perhaps more importantly, and this is the way that I kind of say it,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:47):**  I don't try to make it an ideological decision.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:50):**  You know what, if I can eliminate an input cost from my farming operation, that's just  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:54):**  a good business decision.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:21:56):**  And so if I get up there and I tell farmers, you know, there's another way and it's probably  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:01):**  going to save you money and these other farmers are the ones who figured it out.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:06):**  That just makes a hell of a lot of sense, right?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:10):**  It does.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:11):**  So what, what is that other way?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:13):**  How do we develop agro ecosystems that reduce the need for insect management products and  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:20):**  other agrochemicals?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:23):**  The regenerative farm movement is doing a heck of a good job of it.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:28):**  There's some principles that link these systems that are occurring all over the world.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:33):**  I've heard categories of these principles here, there and everywhere.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:37):**  I think fundamentally reducing or eliminating tillage from your operation is the first step.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:45):**  Never leaving bare soil is the next.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:50):**  Increasing plant diversity whenever possible on your field, be that crop rotation, be that  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:22:58):**  crop, be that field margins, be that intercropping, interseeding cover crops in your crop rows.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:05):**  Those are all great practices that work.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:08):**  And then finally integrating animals and crops together in the same place at the same time.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:17):**  When a system has these elements, they don't have pests.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:20):**  And that's a pretty, that's a really big statement.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:23):**  I think that is a resilient system.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:27):**  I can give you an example.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:29):**  So we have a field that's 12 years no till.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:32):**  I didn't inherit a farm that had degraded resource.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:36):**  I think it had been sprayed with 2,4-D and dicamba to eliminate weeds.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:41):**  But otherwise it's had perennial grass cover for a long time.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:47):**  We had some weeds out there, right?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:49):**  I did use like maybe a half to a quarter rate of Roundup or glyphosate in order to manage  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:55):**  it, just push down some of that vegetation.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:23:58):**  And then I plant our cash crop directly into that.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:01):**  It's an annual cash crop that's put into perennial grass cover.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:06):**  We use our, until I had livestock, I didn't understand how I was going to control those  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:12):**  weeds in any other way.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:15):**  And this spring I ended up high intensity grazing down that weed cover and then we planted  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:20):**  directly in.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:21):**  I think when my flock is big enough of these hair sheep, I don't think I'm going to need  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:25):**  herbicides anymore.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:27):**  So in that case, I'm actually seeing a problem, a pest problem, right, that we're supposed  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:33):**  to react to.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:34):**  I look at that pest problem as an opportunity.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:39):**  So when we had some farm tours, we had a tour of South Africans last year and they were  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:45):**  like, gosh, you've got some weeds out here.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:48):**  And I'm like, where?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:49):**  I don't see any weeds.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:50):**  I see forage, right?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:54):**  I love it.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:24:56):**  And when you change your perspective on things, then you've got real opportunities.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:01):**  When you don't negate the tools that you have in your tool belt, oh, I'm a cropper.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:07):**  I don't raise livestock.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:09):**  That's, you know, that's, well, you know what?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:11):**  Then you're eliminating a really valuable tool from your operation.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:17):**  Speaking of changing perspectives, I've observed that many growers and researchers shift their  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:25):**  perspectives over time as they're on this journey.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:28):**  What is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture that is different  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:35):**  from the mainstream view as your perspective has shifted?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:39):**  When I got into entomology, I was an adherent to, you know, the pest management principles,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:47):**  right?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:48):**  Like you, you go out, sample your fields, you wait until the past reaches a certain  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:54):**  density and then you react.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:25:58):**  What I discovered or was taught by farmers, regenerative farmers, is that if you design  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:04):**  your system right, pest management should not be a reactive process.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:10):**  Pest management is a proactive process.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:12):**  You design a system correctly, then you don't have pests anymore.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:17):**  And if you have a pest outbreak in your field, that means that you're doing something wrong.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:22):**  That's a very, very different philosophy than you get from just about every extension agent  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:30):**  or office, but also much of the infrastructure.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:34):**  So much of our current scientific infrastructure is bent on making a broken system work.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:42):**  Make it work.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:43):**  Figure out how to take this system, change it ever so slightly so that farmers will adopt  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:49):**  it on a huge scale and it'll get them by for a little while longer.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:54):**  Genetically modify the plants, you know, do that.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:57):**  Here's some seed coding.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:26:58):**  This will be easy to use and it'll make the system work.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:02):**  And then ultimately the system always re-breaks.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:06):**  And what I was taught very recently is that we need to stop supporting a broken system  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:14):**  and we need to reinvent how we're thinking about agriculture.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:21):**  It is intriguing how entrenched the current model has become to the point where it's become  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:29):**  dogmatic and no longer is considering new ideas and new inputs as might have been the  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:34):**  case a number of decades ago.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:37):**  On a couple of occasions, you've mentioned that in addition to pesticide evaluations,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:42):**  you've also done evaluations of GMOs and you've mentioned seed coatings a couple of times.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:48):**  I'd love to hear your perspective.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:50):**  What are the things that you've observed and learned about GMOs and how they impact ecosystems?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:27:57):**  Is there a role for, like, modified organisms in regenerative agriculture ecosystems?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:03):**  You know, I'm not fundamentally against genetically modified organisms any more than I am any  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:10):**  other of the tools that are put out there to support the current system.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:15):**  I think that GMOs, seed coatings, pesticides in general, they're a symptom of a greater  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:20):**  problem.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:21):**  And that problem is a simplification of our food system.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:25):**  So in my view, I guess I'm against GMOs because I just don't think they're needed.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:32):**  I think if we were to solve the underlying issue, which is a simplified system where  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:38):**  it's all monoculture, thousands of acres of a single plant species that's genetically  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:42):**  limited and selected to produce only large seeds, or maybe there's a few other small  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:49):**  characteristics that we decided we wanted in that particular organism.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:28:53):**  Since we went down that road, we just predisposed ourselves for pest outbreak after pest outbreak.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:00):**  And really within that context, if that's your system, dead soil and a monoculture,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:06):**  then you know what?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:08):**  You are absolutely reliant on agrochemicals and genetically modified organisms.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:14):**  That's the only way to produce, I think, efficiently within that system.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:19):**  But if you suddenly look at one of your neighbors who's farming regeneratively and you see a  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:25):**  different approach, a different philosophy towards producing food, suddenly it's really  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:33):**  empowering, right?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:35):**  Suddenly you're keeping more money on your own operation, rural communities keep more  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:39):**  money in their own communities.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:42):**  We suddenly have opportunities for stacking enterprises and industries that keep our kids  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:48):**  back out on the farm.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:50):**  We're growing healthier food.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:52):**  Everybody wins in this situation.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:29:56):**  To me, that was something that's worth fighting for and changing my entire life and career  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:01):**  trajectory for.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:07):**  One of the pieces that is really inspiring to me is understanding that we have such tremendous  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:14):**  untapped genetic potential in the crop genetics that we have available today and have had  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:19):**  available for the last 40 years that we have not yet tapped into.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:26):**  And speaking with experts and scientists in the field, Don Huber and Jerry Hatfield and  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:32):**  many others, the implication and in some cases the explicit statement is that the reason  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:38):**  we have this untapped genetic potential that we have failed to realize is because of our  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:46):**  agriculture ecosystems and our soil health.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:49):**  You can only push yields to a certain threshold by applying more nutrients and pesticides.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:55):**  You can't get past that point until you change the system.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:30:58):**  So there's all this discussion around needing to feed a rapidly growing world population  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:04):**  and there's a lot wrapped up in that considering food waste and unequal distribution, etc.,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:11):**  etc.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:12):**  But even leaving those issues on the side, it is very inspiring to me to think that,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:17):**  just as an example, in fruit and vegetable production, there are some crops where yields  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:22):**  have increased by 250 to 300 percent over the last 20 years.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:28):**  Strawberries in California 20 years ago, the average yield was 4,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:34):**  Today it's 10,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:37):**  And the same is true of processing tomato production.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:40):**  There have been a number of crops that we have continued to develop and get rapidly  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:45):**  higher yields, but that hasn't happened yet on our commodity crops, corn, soybeans, etc.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:51):**  And while the evidence is there to suggest that the genetic potential is there to tap  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:31:56):**  into that once we shift our ecosystems and begin growing those plants differently.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:01):**  Yeah, kind of associated with that is that we've got this list of recommendations that  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:09):**  work within degraded soils and or at least they can keep you alive during degraded soils  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:15):**  and in a monoculture situation.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:17):**  But when you start farming down a regenerative road, a lot of the recommendations that are  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:23):**  associated with that current system, and including for idle selection and things like this, you  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:29):**  just throw those rules kind of out the window.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:31):**  I mean, they just don't apply anymore.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:34):**  It's going to necessitate that we end up having to reinvent what we think we know.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:39):**  Yeah, going back to first principles thinking, foundational thinking.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:43):**  Jonathan, what is a book or resource that you recommend the most often to growers and  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:49):**  to agronomists?  
**[0:32:51-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:32:51):**  I love some of the classic stuff like Plowman's Folly and One Straw Revolution are always  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:00):**  good.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:01):**  A lot of the stuff that I tend to read, it tends to be a little bit more technical.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:06):**  Mark Winston's got some great stuff that I would definitely look into some of his stuff  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:10):**  he wrote and then, you know, big picture thinking.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:15):**  I just love anything by Carl Sagan.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:17):**  That guy is, I think you may have been an alien that fell down to earth just to educate  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:22):**  us and kind of think philosophically.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:26):**  Good stuff there too.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:27):**  At least get you thinking.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:28):**  I like being challenged.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:30):**  I like being challenged to think outside my comfort zone.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:33):**  Jonathan, what is the question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:36):**  What's the topic that you would love to talk more about that we haven't approached?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:41):**  You know, you hit on some of the big issues.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:44):**  Gets my attention going.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:46):**  I wish that we could talk more about or hear more discussion about what tends to pertain  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:52):**  to integrating livestock and crops and how to do that effectively and why we would do  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:57):**  stuff like that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:33:59):**  And bees are another issue.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:01):**  Why are the bees dying is a good question.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:04):**  Everybody always needs to come up.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:07):**  Can you tell us a little bit more about what you are doing on your farm with livestock  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:11):**  and how you're integrating livestock into your farming system?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:15):**  Sure.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:16):**  So we have 43 acres.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:19):**  Some people would laugh at that size, but you know, honestly, I don't know that you  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:23):**  can farm regeneratively, truly regeneratively on anything more than 100 acres unless you're  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:30):**  like hiring on a lot of staff.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:32):**  So our farm is 43 acres.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:35):**  Twenty five of that is native unbroken prairie and wetlands.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:41):**  So we're going to leave that.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:43):**  We produce annual crops for seed, honey.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:47):**  We have sheep.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:49):**  We're starting to integrate pastured pork.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:51):**  We have egg production and then we produce some broilers and stuff like that.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:56):**  So it's a pretty integrated system.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:34:58):**  Bringing small pieces and stacking enterprises onto those things.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:04):**  So last year we grew three different crops, borage, phacelia and hubam annual sweet clover,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:14):**  which most farmers have never heard of.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:18):**  But what they all have in common is that they're great cover crop species.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:24):**  They're great in pollinator conservation and things like this.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:28):**  They're all flowering species that just kick out nectar and pollen like you wouldn't believe.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:32):**  And they're all worth money.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:35):**  Why would I plant corn, soybeans, wheat if the market just isn't there for those things?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:43):**  Why would I?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:44):**  So to me, I'd rather sell my crops by the pound than by the bushel.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:49):**  And so these are, these are a little bit of higher risk crops, right?  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:53):**  The borage, I've had a hell of a time trying to harvest.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:35:56):**  We can grow it up through seed production, but it's really fussy on us.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:00):**  It likes to shatter if you stare at it in a funny way.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:04):**  And so I didn't get any crop revenue off of that field, but I still made more money than  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:10):**  my neighbor because I produced so much honey off of that field per acre.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:17):**  So the question that I always ask farmers that come up to visit is how often can you  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:23):**  lose a crop and make more money than the neighbors do?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:29):**  And the answer is every single time when you're farming regeneratively, you know, every time  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:37):**  because you're stacking enterprises, your farm is a resilient business model.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:41):**  You're not tying your entire livelihood to a single commodity.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:47):**  So ours is a complicated unit.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:49):**  It's a complicated unit, but it seems to be working.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:53):**  I'm really surprised to hear you say that you don't think we can farm regeneratively  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:36:59):**  on a scale greater than a hundred acres.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:01):**  I'd love to, could you expand on that a little bit?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:03):**  Because I know that there are some growers who are both in the fruit and vegetable space  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:09):**  and in the broadacre crop space, such as Gabe Brown, for example, who are on a scale of  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:13):**  thousands of acres.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:14):**  We're making some very substantial progress.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:17):**  I think you can make some substantial progress.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:20):**  And I think that we can farm larger acreage is a lot better than what we are right now.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:24):**  And we can apply some of these principles.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:27):**  But when you're starting to talk about integrating, you know, livestock as a weed control measure  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:36):**  or just maintaining perennial fruit and nut production, annual crops, you know, a number  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:41):**  of different livestock, the amount of maintenance, at least in my experience, has to go into  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:48):**  that system in order to keep it productive and keep it moving in such a way that the  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:37:55):**  ecological processes are hitting on many different aspects of the farm all the time.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:00):**  Man, that's really difficult.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:04):**  But what's also really important to realize is that the goal of farming at a conventional  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:10):**  scale, regeneratively, is probably misguided.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:16):**  I think that if you are farming in a regenerative nature and stacking those enterprises and  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:23):**  having those different tools at your disposal, then you don't need to farm at such a great  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:30):**  scale anymore.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:31):**  The average farm size doesn't have to be 400 to 1,000 acres.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:36):**  It can be closer to 100 to 150 acres.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:40):**  And you're still generating the revenue that's needed there.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:43):**  I don't know, that's my thoughts, at least all of those things are debatable.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:49):**  I do agree with you that there is a, the regenerative agriculture ecosystems, in my experience,  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:38:57):**  what I've observed, they're always more profitable.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:00):**  We've got data to show.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, they're always more profitable.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:05):**  They are extremely climate resilient.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:08):**  And there is something that I would refer to it as the heart to acres ratio.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:14):**  That in order to, as we were discussing earlier, to be really observant and to really have  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:19):**  a connection to what is happening on your farm, you need to spend time with your feet  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:25):**  on the ground and your hands in the soil and on the plants, not just riding a four wheeler  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:29):**  or pickup truck.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:31):**  Definitely, there is a limitation to how many acres you can do that well with.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:36):**  I also agree that, I've used the words before of scale appropriate.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:44):**  There is, depending on the environment and the ecosystem that you're in, what is natively  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:47):**  adapted to grow well there.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:50):**  I think scale appropriate can mean different things in different places.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:53):**  But generally when you have a smaller scale, you have a more intense production because  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:39:58):**  you have more layers on a single operation.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:01):**  And that can add a tremendous amount of value.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:04):**  And I do also think it can be possible to do it on a larger scale, but you lose some  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:10):**  of those benefits that you've just been talking about.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:13):**  Yeah, maybe putting a magic number on it isn't the most appropriate thing, but adopting the  
**[0:40:19-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:19):**  philosophy that you can farm smaller better is really a goal that's kind of associated  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:27):**  with a regenerative production system, maybe a better way of explaining it.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:33):**  I was looking at the neighbor who was selling some land across the road from me and I was  
**[0:40:39-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:39):**  looking at that 75 acres and then I was thinking to myself, I'm like, God, I got 43 acres right  
**[0:40:47-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:47):**  now and I'm riding this all the time it feels like, or at least I could be.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:54):**  Why would I expand out with another 75 acres?  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:57):**  Maybe I'll hit a certain threshold with this farm.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:40:59):**  I've only been here for three years or this'll be my third summer on it.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:03):**  I'll see where it goes.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:05):**  I'm really intrigued when you describe your farming operation, your primary crops, everything  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:10):**  is revolving around honeybees and honeybees and you've mentioned the importance of beekeeping.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:16):**  What is your background with honeybees and talk a little bit more about that.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:20):**  So I'm an anthropologist and so bees are, it's sort of siloed, right?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:25):**  It's not crops.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:26):**  And a lot of, most people don't think of it as livestock either, and I would really beg  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:30):**  to differ.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:31):**  Bees are just another form of livestock, aren't they?  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:35):**  And so personally, you know, I've never been a farmer.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:39):**  I've never been a beekeeper when we started this research farm.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:44):**  I mean, I advise beekeepers and I advise farmers and scientists and we've done work on all  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:50):**  of these things.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:51):**  But I just thought when I left the USDA to start Blue Dasher Farm, you know, and Anakdisus  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:41:58):**  Foundation is our nonprofit.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:00):**  It was kind of like, in order to really serve, I had to experience what the beekeepers and  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:06):**  the farmers were experiencing firsthand and tying our own livelihood to the operation  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:12):**  of a regenerative farming operation.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:15):**  So I had never kept bees, you know, professionally.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:18):**  I'd never been a farmer professionally and I've learned a hell of a lot in the last three  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:22):**  years and I've made a hell of a lot of mistakes in the last three years.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:26):**  But at the same time, it's given me such new perspective on just the diversity of skills  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:32):**  that farmers need and the experience.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:35):**  And it also raised in my own consciousness the fact that, you know, some of the best  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:41):**  naturalists that I've ever met are farmers and beekeepers.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:46):**  You know, just observers of the natural world.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:49):**  Awesome.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:50):**  I like that because actually that means a lot to me personally because before I started  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:42:57):**  doing my current consulting work, starting advancing eco agriculture and working in the  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:02):**  regenerative agriculture field, my dream was to be a full time beekeeper.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:06):**  I had some over 30 colonies of honeybees from the age of 12 and I still have that as a hobby  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:10):**  today and I love it.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:12):**  I love it.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:13):**  There's nothing more invigorating, more invigorating than opening up a box of 10,000 stinging insects  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:21):**  and just like, you know what, they don't care.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:25):**  If you've got the right queen.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:27):**  I had some Africanized hives that were mean as cuffs.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:31):**  But this year they're really friendly and it's like, yeah, they kind of just let you  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:35):**  into this world that is almost unimaginable.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:40):**  You know, who could come up with honeybees?  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:42):**  I mean, who could imagine something like that and you know, science fiction or in Hollywood,  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:48):**  right?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:49):**  There's something really special about that.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:52):**  Unless you really screw things up.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:43:55):**  It's always a very calming experience for me to be out and working with honeybees because  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:01):**  you have to be in that calm space to really work with them well and not get things riled  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:05):**  up.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:06):**  So it's a very calming experience as well.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:09):**  Doc in general has taught that to me about myself.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:13):**  And how to respond to social interactions in my own life.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:17):**  It's like when the sheep get out of the paddock, they want to be back in that paddock, but  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:24):**  you can't rush them, right?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:26):**  You can't run after them.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:28):**  You have to, you nudge them, right?  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:30):**  And then you, and then if they don't, then they almost get back into their fence where  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:37):**  they want to be originally, but then they take off in another direction and you just  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:42):**  have to take a deep breath and just be like, all right, I'm going to go and do this again.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:46):**  You know, very slowly, very methodically and teaches you patience.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:51):**  It teaches you self-awareness and it's something that our society has lost.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:44:58):**  I think this is an important topic for us to speak a bit about because it's perhaps  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:02):**  something that farmers might not hear very often.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:05):**  Can you tell us a little bit about, in the scope of your 43 acre farming operation, how  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:11):**  many colonies of honeybees do you have and what is the economic contribution of those  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:17):**  as a proportion of your overall farming operation?  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:21):**  We have a hundred hives on our land when the bees are, so we had to build comb over the  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:28):**  first couple of years.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:29):**  And that's something that I think a lot of farmers, a lot of new guys may not understand  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:34):**  that I didn't, is that a lot of the honey initially goes into comb production.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:39):**  Right now, I mean, we're expecting to be able to pull down the 3000 pounds of honey off  
**[0:45:45-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:45):**  of our farm and then we sell it at $8 a pound and I can't keep it in stock.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:52):**  I can't keep it in stock.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:54):**  So our farm is really designed to produce honey.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:45:59):**  That's revenue of $500 an acre without even considering all the other production and everything  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:04):**  else that is happening.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:06):**  That's right.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:07):**  Plus I'm taking meat production off in terms of the sheep and pasture pork and then we're  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:11):**  also taking the annual crop seed off when we can get it.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:15):**  But if I don't, you know what, that's not such a big deal.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:20):**  I've got a pretty good system designed there.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:24):**  The honey production is the majority of our revenue at this point.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:28):**  That's why we've kind of designed it the way we have.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:31):**  I think that a lot of farmers and maybe even consumers don't even know what real honey  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:35):**  tastes like.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:36):**  I mean, honey that you buy at the grocery store, that's not honey.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:41):**  No, it resembles corn syrup more than it does real honey.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:45):**  Yes, absolutely it is.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:47):**  Because a lot of the big box stores, they buy their honey from international markets  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:52):**  and China and India are dumping honey in North America right now and it's not honey.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:46:58):**  It's like rice sugar that they've adulterated to get through customs.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:03):**  And so they're just dumping it that drives the price way, way down.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:07):**  Beekeepers are just like, what are these guys doing?  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:10):**  And then when you do get clover honey, sometimes they produce that honey not off a nectar because  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:14):**  there isn't enough nectar in the environment anymore to support a lot of bee colonies.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:18):**  And so a lot of beekeepers end up feeding their hives with sugar water or corn syrup  
**[0:47:23-0:47:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:23):**  water.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:24):**  And that honey that's then created, it doesn't have the floral bouquet, the flavor and the  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:31):**  smell of what real honey is.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:33):**  We don't feed our bees except we'll feed them honey during June when there's a dearth.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:38):**  But there is almost nothing better than just like reaching into a beehive when it's still  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:46):**  warm and that honey coming out, oh my gosh.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:51):**  I'm totally with you on that.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:52):**  I can really relate.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:54):**  You know, honey has, people who are aware and educated about this are aware that honey  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:47:57):**  has different flavors, but feedback that I've received from buyers of honey that I've produced  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:04):**  and that I've worked with is that this honey is different.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:07):**  It makes my lips tingle.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:08):**  It makes my mouth tingle.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:10):**  I feel energized from it.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:12):**  That's what real honey is supposed to be like.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:15):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:17):**  And it's good for you.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:19):**  You know how good it is for you?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:21):**  I mean, it jazzes up your immune system.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:23):**  It's like, yeah, it's not at all.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:26):**  Honey bees and the decline in honey bees and the difficulty that we have.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:29):**  I mean, I've never kept hives alive all winter yet.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:32):**  I'm going to try something different this winter, but we can't keep them going.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:37):**  And it's so discouraging for me to look at the learning disabilities that the bees have  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:43):**  adopted from the agrochemical exposure that they're getting out in the environment.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:47):**  I mean, my God, they're just the canaries in the coal mine here.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:52):**  I think you have the capacity to offer a unique perspective on this with your background as  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:56):**  an entomologist and looking at agroecology.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:48:59):**  Why are the honey bees dying?  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:01):**  You want to save the bees, you heal the soil.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:05):**  A number of pollinator groups have adopted that since I first started saying it, but  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:10):**  it's absolutely true.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:11):**  I mean, the bee die off is totally a symptom of the simplification of our food system.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:20):**  Lack of floral resources, lack of flowers, nectar, pollen for the bees to eat.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:27):**  So they're nutritionally, they're starving.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:29):**  Then you've got all of the pesticide exposure.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:32):**  When scientists have looked, we found 90 different pesticides in beehives.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:37):**  Bees aggregate these things into the wax and their comb.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:41):**  And so their larvae are constantly exposed to this whole suite of different agrochemicals  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:49):**  that we are being exposed to as well.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:52):**  And lo and behold, starving, poisoned bees get sick.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:49:58):**  And so enter in the varroa mite, enter in the viruses, enter in the bacterial and fungal  
**[0:50:04-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:04):**  diseases.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:05):**  And it's just like a perfect storm.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:07):**  But you can silo all of those issues, right?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:10):**  Oh, I'm going to, oh, the varroa mite, the varroa mite must be killing.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:13):**  I'm going to work on the varroa mite, or I'm going to get rid of all these pesticides.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:18):**  And I mean, we're just at the state where component research and component solutions  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:23):**  aren't going to get us where we've got to be.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:25):**  It's got to be a systems level change.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:28):**  And that's been the direction that we push forward.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:31):**  And the beekeepers get it.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:32):**  A couple of thoughts for you on overwintering.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:36):**  I'm sure you probably know more than I do.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:38):**  No, I'm listening.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:40):**  What do you got?  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:41):**  I started doing something pretty interesting three years ago.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:45):**  And I started berating myself as soon as I opened my mouth because I had 100% losses  
**[0:50:50-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:50):**  last year.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:51):**  So who am I qualified to have an opinion?  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:55):**  But for the two years prior, I was actually successful overwintering.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:50:58):**  And I learned a technique from an aeronautical engineer where he was dealing a lot with attempting  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:05):**  to remove the self-generated humidity from within the hive.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:09):**  And he developed this idea of where he would remove the north sidewall frame and replace  
**[0:51:16-0:51:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:16):**  it with a piece of marine board.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:18):**  And he'd do this all the way down throughout the entire colony to have basically a barrier  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:23):**  layer of the marine board between the marine board sidewall all the way down.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:27):**  The principle was that if there was any condensation or humidity within the colony, it would accumulate  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:34):**  only between 100% of it would be in that crevice between the marine board and the sidewall  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:40):**  of the colony.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:41):**  It doesn't actually work that way.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:43):**  It removes all of the humidity and the condensation from other parts of the colony.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:48):**  That's been a big problem for us, for sure.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:51):**  You're taking out a frame?  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:52):**  Yes, he was taking out one frame and then he basically cut it long enough so that it  
**[0:51:56-0:51:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:56):**  would fit all the way from the top of the colony.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:51:58):**  He was using two deeps that would go all the way from the top here to the bottom board.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:02):**  So he didn't want any splits and not see some marine board.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:05):**  I'm going to try it.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:06):**  I'll give it a shot.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:07):**  The other thing that I've been hearing, I'm going to try overwintering them as nucs in  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:14):**  one of our sheds this winter and see whether or not they have to replace the resources,  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:20):**  the resource frames every so often that way.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:23):**  But I guess that they're able to regulate temperature a little bit better.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:26):**  The problem is, and I think this is again, this probably is an artifact of a neonic exposure,  
**[0:52:32-0:52:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:32):**  is that that first frost, man, they just, they don't know how to form a ball in order  
**[0:52:41-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:41):**  to conserve heat.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:43):**  And so you see a major die off.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:45):**  We lost half of the hides after the first frost.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:48):**  They were going strong, going home and then boom, they just crashed.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:53):**  What happened?  
**[0:52:54-0:52:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:54):**  And a couple of the beekeepers have said, well, I think they don't still know how to  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:57):**  form a ball anymore.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:52:58):**  They can't remember.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:00):**  That's really interesting because I have extensive family, cousins, aunts and uncles and all  
**[0:53:06-0:53:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:06):**  in the thumb of Michigan.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:08):**  They have started putting their honeybee colonies in caches over winter and with incredible  
**[0:53:15-0:53:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:15):**  success.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:16):**  I mean, if they have a last three or four years, they've had 90 plus percent overwintering  
**[0:53:22-0:53:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:22):**  success.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:23):**  That's kind of blew my mind.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:25):**  What did they put them in?  
**[0:53:26-0:53:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:26):**  Plastic calf hutches that you can think of them almost as a miniature greenhouse.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:31):**  Protect them from the wind.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:32):**  They're warmer during the winter months.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:34):**  I was in this blue, get cold, but they warm up pretty quickly whenever the sun hits them.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:39):**  So five or six in a hutch or something like that.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:42):**  You think?  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:43):**  Yes.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:44):**  Actually I want to say three or four.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:46):**  Okay.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:47):**  And that way the hive heat itself isn't going to get overwhelming either.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:51):**  Is it?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:53):**  What bothers me is that overwintering did not used to be this much of a challenge.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:53:58):**  I think, yeah, you've always lost a few hives if you will, were wintered up north, but this  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:04):**  just seems like nobody is successful.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:06):**  I talked to all of the beekeepers in the region.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:08):**  Nobody had their hives survived this last year.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:11):**  Wow.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:12):**  That's bad.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:13):**  I think there's something bigger going on, but well, I think we talked about a lot of  
**[0:54:17-0:54:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:17):**  that today.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:18):**  Not a lot of people want to hear it maybe, but it needs to be said.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:24):**  Jonathan, thank you so much for sharing all of your insights.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:28):**  I've enjoyed this discussion tremendously and I'm sure many others will as well.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/ecosystem-diversity-prevents-insect-pressure-with-jonathan-lundgren/#t=0:54:32):**  No, my pleasure.

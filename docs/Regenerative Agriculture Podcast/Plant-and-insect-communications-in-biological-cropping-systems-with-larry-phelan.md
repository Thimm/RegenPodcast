**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,

**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:18):**  memorable moments that have led you to where you are today and led you to some of the projects that  
**[0:03:23-0:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:23):**  you were working on? Well, first of all, I want to start off by saying that all that we do is  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:31):**  generated by the observations and the experiences of farmers. And so I actually, when I, this area  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:40):**  of research represented a pretty significant career change for me. I was actually trained as  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:47):**  what's called a chemical ecologist, which means we would identify pheromones and plant attractants  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:03:54):**  for insects as possible alternatives to pesticides. But as I was doing this and started talking to  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:02):**  organic farmers, one of the things that kept coming up was that they had fewer problems with  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:08):**  insect pests than their conventional neighbors. This was not true necessarily of all crops,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:14):**  but these were field crops that I was talking about here. And I was really intrigued by that  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:22):**  and found that there was not that much known about that in the literature. And so talking to them,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:28):**  we basically formulated hypotheses to try to understand what it was that they were observing.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:36):**  So first of all, we did document that what they were saying was actually true. And pretty  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:43):**  consistently we're seeing lower levels of insect damage. And so yeah, that just really changed  
**[0:04:52-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:04:52):**  the direction of my research. And so now we, about 20, 25 years ago, I switched and we started  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:01):**  focusing on the soil and the microbial community and nutrient cycling and all kinds of things that  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:06):**  I really didn't know that much about at the time. But you kind of have to go where the data takes  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:12):**  you. With some of the original research that you did comparing the insect pressure on the  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:20):**  organic farms versus the non-organic farms, this is actually something that I often hear these  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:26):**  stories from organic growers, but I haven't uncovered a lot of research where people have  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:32):**  actually tried to do a comparison and evaluate the differences. So what were, I guess the question  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:40):**  I would have for you is what were the differences that you were seeing? What really stood out for  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:44):**  you? Well again, keeping in context that this was 20, 25 years ago, there's been a lot more  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:50):**  research in organic systems now, but at the time organic farming was considered very unscientific  
**[0:05:57-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:05:57):**  and more new age and not amenable to large scale production and all of that. And so I was working  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:08):**  with a lot of organic farmers that were basically doing their own research, you know, not necessarily  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:14):**  replicated research like we would do at the university, but trying different things and  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:19):**  seeing what worked on their farm. And so this is the context in which we got started. And so I  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:25):**  actually received a lot of criticism at the time that what I was doing was not very productive or  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:32):**  not the direction that I should be going as an untenured faculty member particularly. So,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:39):**  but what we did was we went to these, in this case these were corn soybean farmers and the  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:45):**  organic producers were, I think all the ones we worked with also raised animals, had animals  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:06:52):**  integrated into their system as well. And first of all, just did census of using, looking at their  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:01):**  corn, looking at the levels of European corn borer damage in their fields versus their conventional  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:09):**  neighbors. And as I'm sure you and many of your listeners have already often heard, I kept hearing  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:17):**  this idea that if we have a healthy soil then we're going to have a healthy plant and insects  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:23):**  don't like healthy plants. And so that's why they don't see the damage. And so again, I saw that as,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:29):**  although that in itself is not a very scientific statement, we could reformulate that as a  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:35):**  hypothesis that we could test empirically. And so what we did was to collect soils from these  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:41):**  organic farms and then go right across the street to a conventional neighbor, collect their soils,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:48):**  brought these soils into the greenhouse and planted them to corn and either fertilized each  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:07:54):**  of them either with an organic fertilizer like manure or compost or with a chemical fertilizer.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:02):**  And so what we were interested in figuring out was first of all, whether the insects could tell  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:09):**  a difference in these plants and if they could tell a difference, was it associated with that  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:14):**  what I would call the short-term effect of the type of fertilizer you use or that long-term  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:20):**  effect of that history of management and how that impacted the soil community. And so after  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:27):**  setting these plants up and letting them grow to a certain stage, we then released European  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:34):**  corn borer females that had been mated into the greenhouse. And again, all of this was replicated  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:40):**  and randomized and we just let them loose and see where they would lay their eggs. And what we  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:46):**  found very consistently, we actually repeated this experiment I think with four or five different  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:08:52):**  pairs of farms or soils from farms, consistently we found if the plant was growing in a soil from  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:00):**  an organic farm, irrespective of the fertilizer we applied, they received relatively few eggs.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:07):**  Whereas if that plant was growing in a plant or a soil from a conventional farm, sometimes they  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:13):**  would receive a lot of eggs and sometimes they would receive only a few eggs. And so this gave

**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:24):**  is kind of our working hypothesis, was in that in those organic systems where you have a recurring  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:32):**  influx of organic matter either in in terms of cover crops or plant manures or animal manures  
**[0:09:39-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:39):**  into those soils, you create this soil community which is beneficial to the plant.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:49):**  And so when nutrients then go into that system, they get absorbed by this microbial community  
**[0:09:55-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:09:55):**  and then they release those nutrients very slowly over time. And as a result, we hypothesize that  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:04):**  those plants are in better mineral balance than when you're putting down high levels of nutrients.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:11):**  Why this would be important is that plants are almost always limited by nitrogen levels and so  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:21):**  they don't have mechanisms for dampening the levels of nitrogen that they take up. They're  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:28):**  going to take up whatever they can get and in this context of putting down inorganic  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:36):**  highly soluble nitrogen sources, often these plants are taking up much higher levels of nitrogen  
**[0:10:44-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:44):**  than they are really set up to deal with. And so we then hypothesize that in that situation  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:10:54):**  those plants would tend to accumulate the simple compounds. And so as you have an imbalance of  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:01):**  nutrients, when you have an imbalance of nutrients, let's say nitrogen to potassium, if you think about  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:07):**  those two elements, nitrogen of course is very important in terms of protein synthesis and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:13):**  potassium is also important in terms of converting amino acids into protein. So if you have an  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:20):**  imbalance, you have too much nitrogen relative to potassium, what happens is you get the buildup of  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:27):**  free amino acids in those plants and insects love free amino acids. That's a very  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:34):**  digestible source of nutrients for them because they're also highly limited by nitrogen. And so  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:41):**  in those situations where you have these imbalances, that plant becomes very nutritious for  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:49):**  the insect, whereas in the plant that is in better mineral balance where they're getting their  
**[0:11:53-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:11:53):**  nutrients relatively slowly, that metabolic machinery of the plant is able to act more  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:02):**  efficiently. And so as amino acids and sugars are produced in the plant, they're more immediately  
**[0:12:09-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:09):**  converted to the less digestible and more complex building blocks of the plant like proteins

**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:21):**  Larry, you've mentioned a couple of fascinating pieces that I'd love to unravel a little bit more.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:28):**  The idea of biological buffering, what you're describing in essence, if I'm  
**[0:12:34-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:34):**  understanding you correctly, is the capacity of biology in the soil to absorb large amounts of  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:43):**  nutrients that are applied and contain those nutrients within their cells and then release  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:48):**  them over a period of time. Is that what you're describing?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:51):**  Yes. So even in this artificial situation that we created where we put inorganic fertilizer  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:12:58):**  into a soil that had an organic history, even in that situation, that organic soil, that soil from  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:06):**  that organic farm had enough carbon lying around where those microbes could actually use that  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:12):**  inorganic form of nitrogen and then in combination with the carbon that was there and then  
**[0:13:20-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:20):**  bring that into that microbial community. And then as they then die off and you have  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:30):**  other organisms that are feeding on those microbes, they then allow for the mineralization  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:37):**  of some of these compounds, these nitrogenous compounds, and then it becomes available to the plant.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:45):**  And so we did, to follow up on this, we studied the dynamics of nitrogen across the growing season  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:53):**  in these organic and conventional corn fields, just as we would have expected. When you look at  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:13:59):**  a conventional system where you have in the spring the farmers putting down relatively high levels  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:06):**  of soluble fertilizer and really not much carbon other than maybe some plant residue, you see huge  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:13):**  fluctuations in terms of the availability of those, of that nitrogen. So of course before  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:20):**  fertilization, nitrogen levels are very low, the farmer applies the fertilizer, now they shoot way up  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:27):**  well above what the plant can use, and then over the course of the growing season that  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:34):**  nitrogen then declines. But if you look at that same pattern in an organic system, what we found  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:40):**  was that the levels of nitrogen, of soluble nitrogen in the soil solution generally were lower  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:48):**  overall and they also didn't vary much during the course of the year. And so that plant was getting  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:14:55):**  this kind of constant supply, steady supply of nitrogen throughout the growing season.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:02):**  And really what we found when we compared these farms was that overall there was no difference  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:10):**  in terms of the production at the end of the year between the organic and conventional farms.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:17):**  I'd also love to understand the insect attraction piece a bit better. You mentioned that when you  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:26):**  have this surge of nitrogen supply on the non-organic farms from the nutrient application  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:34):**  period, you have an increased attraction because you have a nutrient rich food source.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:39):**  Why are insects, why can insects not utilize plants as a food source that don't contain as  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:47):**  high levels of amino acids? Because they would also contain some level of amino acids, no?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:52):**  Yes, yeah all plants are going to have some levels of free amino acids and they can also digest  
**[0:15:59-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:15:59):**  protein. Let's keep that in mind too. But that protein, it's going to take energy for that insect  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:08):**  to digest that protein. Furthermore, a lot of plants have defenses that involve the inhibition  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:15):**  of enzymes that break down protein in the insect. These are called protease inhibitors.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:23):**  And this is actually in terms of what we call inducible defenses. This is one of the mechanisms  
**[0:16:30-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:30):**  of many or the responses of many plants to insect attack. They start the production of these  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:38):**  protease inhibitors in order to reduce the insect's ability to digest that protein. It basically  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:46):**  knocks out those proteases in the insect. And so the insect doesn't necessarily starve, but it  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:16:55):**  slows their development way down. Well in that situation, if you've also given that plant much,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:02):**  you know, these high levels of nitrogen and it's accumulating these free amino acids,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:08):**  that now short circuits that plant defense system. So in other words, the insect doesn't need those  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:14):**  proteases as much because it has, it's getting these free amino acids that it doesn't have to  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:21):**  break down. Got it. That was a piece that I had always not fully understood because I've heard  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:28):**  it described that insects don't have the capacity to digest complete proteins and that they're  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:34):**  dependent on soluble amino acids as a food source. And that never quite made sense to me. It made  
**[0:17:42-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:42):**  sense from a theoretical perspective, but it didn't make sense to me that plants might have  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:51):**  no amino acids versus one plant having very high levels of amino acids. Yeah, it's a matter of  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:17:57):**  degree. And even proteins, they vary in terms of their digestibility for insects too. And of  
**[0:18:04-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:04):**  course, insects evolve enzymes that are going to be most effective at digesting the proteins  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:13):**  they're likely to encounter, you know, depending on what host plant they feed on. As you were  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:19):**  looking at these plant insect and dynamics in the field and developing your hypothesis of biological

**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:35):**  was necessarily a surprise. Maybe I'll think of something that was more surprising later, but  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:41):**  the one thing that was particularly exciting to us is when we took the next step and we tested  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:47):**  this idea that mineral balance resulting from this biological buffering of organic matter,  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:18:54):**  we started growing plants hydroponically so that we could vary the proportions of different  
**[0:19:00-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:00):**  nutrients. And the idea is that if the hypothesis we were testing was actually that when the plant  
**[0:19:09-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:09):**  was in good mineral balance, you would get both good growth, but also resistance to insect attack.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:18):**  And then as the plant moved out of balance nutritionally, you would see plant growth go down  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:27):**  and insect performance actually go up. And then ultimately, as the plant was way out of balance  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:32):**  nutritionally, then we expected that the plant, you know, wouldn't grow very well. And then  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:37):**  ultimately the insects wouldn't do very well either because it was just such a poor host plant.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:44):**  And so we tested this with a number of different combinations of nutrients. And the one that was

**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:19:58):**  varied the ratios of ammonia to nitrate to the plant. So we provided it all the nutrients that  
**[0:20:06-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:06):**  it needed in constant levels for all the plants. But what we were testing was different ratios  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:14):**  between these two different forms of nitrogen. And what we found was that as we increased the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:20):**  amount of ammonia up to about 30%, that is where we saw the best plant growth. So that ratio of 30%  
**[0:20:28-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:28):**  ammonia, 70% nitrate is where we got the best plant growth. And then when we looked at insects,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:37):**  so what we did was to pluck the leaves off these plants and then feed them to insects and see how  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:42):**  the insects grew. And this particular insect we were working with was the Mexican bean beetle.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:48):**  And when we fed these leaves to the Mexican bean beetle, we saw just the opposite response. So in  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:53):**  other words, where the plant was out of balance nutritionally, not growing very well, that's where  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:20:59):**  the insects did the largest. And that's where we saw the best survivorship. But as we move towards  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:05):**  that 30% ammonia where the plants were growing their biggest, insect survivorship, larval  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:12):**  survivorship dropped from about 90% down to about 30% or 40%. So it was a very dramatic effect. And  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:21):**  actually even more dramatic than what we were expecting. And then when we followed up on this,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:27):**  and we measured the levels of free amino acids in these plants, it was consistent with prediction.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:33):**  So then in other words, those plants that were not growing as well, that were out of balance in terms  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:39):**  of this ratio, they had much higher levels of free amino acids relative to that 30% ammonia plant.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:46):**  When you were looking at these various ratios between ammonium and nitrate, what was the  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:21:53):**  total nitrogen rate being applied? Well, in this case, again, we are growing these hydroponically,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:00):**  so as there wouldn't be really, don't know that would be relevant to the field setting.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:05):**  We actually tried, we ran this experiment with three different total levels of nitrogen  
**[0:22:12-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:12):**  in solution and saw the most dramatic effect was with the highest level of nitrogen overall,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:21):**  and that's where we got the best plant growth. Absolutely fascinating. It's fascinating research.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:27):**  So going back to the discussion regarding biological buffering and the things that you  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:33):**  observed with insect attraction or desirability, what is, if you were to extend that out and  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:41):**  the additional research that you've done over the years, what is the practical take-home message  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:47):**  that a grower should consider thinking about or implementing on his farm? How do we take this  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:22:54):**  information and put it into practical application? Well, in the all the studies that we've done and  
**[0:23:00-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:00):**  different things that we've looked at, this message just keeps recurring, that of denoting the  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:09):**  demonstrating the importance of organic matter addition to the soil. And so, you know, as I've  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:16):**  said before, the mineral balance is part of the picture. That's really important, but the dynamics  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:24):**  of the nutrient availability can be, is also important. And so other words, we need that  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:31):**  influx of active organic matter going into that system in order to sustain this beneficial  
**[0:23:39-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:39):**  microbial community. And that has the effect not only of balancing those nutrients, but it also  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:48):**  enhances this other completely different group of microbes that I'm sure you're already familiar  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:54):**  with. And these are the ones that live in the rhizosphere, including what we call the plant  
**[0:23:58-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:23:58):**  growth promoting rhizobacteria and rhizofungi. They are also enhanced in a system where you have  
**[0:24:07-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:07):**  relatively low nutrient availability, but being made available to the plant in a sustained rate.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:15):**  So you have a number of benefits that flow from that influx of organic matter. And imagine you're,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:24):**  most of your listeners are already familiar with this distinction, but when we talk about organic  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:28):**  matter, it's important that we distinguish between old organic matter and biologically active  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:35):**  organic matter. So when you get your soil test, most of that organic matter in your soil test is  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:41):**  what we call recalcitrant or this organic matter or organic matter that's, you know, hundreds or  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:48):**  thousands of years old. And it's now in a stable form that microbes can no longer utilize and  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:53):**  break down any further. And so now this has, this provides the benefits that we're all familiar with  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:24:59):**  in terms of tension of moisture and buffering of pH and that sort of thing. And that's actually  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:07):**  where this concept of biological buffering came from, is we already knew these chemical and  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:13):**  physical benefits of soil organic matter. And what I was trying to do was extend this concept  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:19):**  to the biological realm of the soil and show how this organic matter also could buffer biological  
**[0:25:25-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:25):**  interactions between the plant and its environment. And so what we need to measure and focus on is  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:34):**  that active organic matter. So this is the relatively young organic matter that's going  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:40):**  into the system, either as like I say, plant manures or animal newers, you know, plowing down  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:45):**  of cover crops and that sort of thing, different sources of that. That to me is, I think, really  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:25:53):**  key to a successful ecological based agriculture.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:00):**  When you use the terminology of biological buffering, kind of the extended implication is  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:08):**  that when you are buffering something, you're buffering something that has the  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:13):**  potential to have a negative impact. I think in this case, perhaps referring to nutrient  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:18):**  applications that contain high concentrations of soluble ions that are serving as an electrolyte,  
**[0:26:23-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:23):**  which might have a damaging effect on soil biology. What did you find the impact to be  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:31):**  of the, say a nitrogen application on the soil's biological profile?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:37):**  Well, we haven't actually measured that directly. Before we started the podcast here,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:44):**  I mentioned to you a project that we're doing now in Cleveland, looking at the impact of industrial  
**[0:26:50-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:26:50):**  legacy of Cleveland's soils and its history of lead smelting and metalworks and in whether,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:00):**  to what degree, or organic farming could improve those soils. And so we are starting to look at,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:07):**  for the first time, my group, not others, others have done this, but our group is for the first  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:12):**  time is actually starting to identify the microbes that are living there. And we're certainly seeing  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:18):**  differences in terms of those communities, depending on the levels of nitrogen that are  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:26):**  present. But we, in that study, we're not comparing, say organic farms to conventional farms.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:34):**  We're comparing unmanaged soils to organically managed soils. So we don't expect to see the same  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:43):**  differences we'd see if we're doing this study out in the rural setting where we're comparing  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:49):**  farms that have high levels of organic matter going in versus those that are not using organic  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:27:54):**  matter. But so I can't specifically tell you what the differences are. I can tell you it definitely  
**[0:28:00-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:00):**  has an impact in the soil community and in terms of the plant response, and this gets us into a  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:09):**  different realm, but the plant is in control in terms of this rhizosphere community. So  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:18):**  it is pumping out high levels of carbon into the soil. Some people have estimated the amount of  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:27):**  photosynthate that it's produced, it's pumping out as much as 40 percent of that into the soil. And  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:35):**  that's a huge amount of investment. So that tells us that that plant is, must be getting something  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:43):**  from the soil community. But more recent studies, very recent studies have demonstrated not only is  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:49):**  it pumping out, the plant pumping out the things like sugars and alcohols, poly alcohols, but it  
**[0:28:58-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:28:58):**  can actually change the soup that it sends out depending on what it needs. So it's actively  
**[0:29:07-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:07):**  recruiting a microbial community, it appears, depending on what the stress is or what the

**[0:29:24-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:24):**  pay that microbial community to say harvest phosphorus from the soil for it, for the plant,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:33):**  because the plant can get it for free. It's just lying around there where it's very readily  
**[0:29:38-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:38):**  available. And so it will shut down those exudates and close itself off from infection by  
**[0:29:49-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:49):**  mycorrhizae and beneficial microbes. But this has other effects too because those beneficial  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:29:58):**  microbes and those mycorrhizae provide other benefits to the plant, including increasing the

**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:30:34):**  it needs here, all the nutrients it needs. And so it's going to invest more in growth above the  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:30:39):**  ground. Well, what happens when you come to July and then now the rain stops and we start to have  
**[0:30:45-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:30:45):**  a drought? That plant is in trouble because it doesn't have the root system to deal with  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:30:53):**  trying to gather the water from a larger area. Whereas when you had this symbiotic system  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:31:02):**  with the mycorrhizae and they are stretching out further into the soil, you now have help in that

**[0:31:17-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:31:17):**  of these extremes. So the idea is that you want to create a system, manage your soil to create this  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:31:26):**  environment where the plant doesn't encounter the extremes, either in terms of outbreaks of

**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:31:49):**  you have pointed out a couple of pieces that we have observed in the field. To your first point  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:31:56):**  regarding mycorrhizae, we have absolutely observed that when growers apply soluble phosphorus at  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:02):**  planting or at transplanting for a vegetable crop, that there is a chance that they will be able to  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:08):**  transplanting for a vegetable crop that there is very limited or perhaps no mycorrhizae association,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:15):**  not just for a period shortly after planting, but in many cases for the duration of that plant's  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:21):**  life, particularly for annual plants. And I certainly have observed that. But I think the  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:28):**  piece that has really caught my attention is what you're describing in essence is the idea of  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:35):**  putting on soluble fertilizers at planting as a row starter on broadacre crops is perhaps the  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:42):**  exact and precise wrong thing to do because you are limiting the development of the root system  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:48):**  and limiting the development of the microbial community in the rhizosphere is essentially what  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:53):**  you're describing. Yeah, and I think that that stems from, and I have to say that I'm not a  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:32:59):**  field agronomist here, so I don't want to step too far out of the bounds of what I really know.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:06):**  But I would say that my impression is that that starts from the idea that we all want to get  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:11):**  those those plants up and moving. And so I can see the appeal of putting down a little starter  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:18):**  fertilizer so you can get those plants growing quickly. But again, one of the things that we  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:25):**  observe in terms of this organic conventional comparisons that we did 20 years ago was the  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:32):**  difference in the growth pattern. So when we're comparing these paired farms, you know, early in  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:39):**  the spring I was looking at these, you know, go to the conventional field and I see these plants  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:45):**  that are very dark green and rich and they're up to my knees and I go over to the organic farm and  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:52):**  the plants are kind of scrawny looking and not very tall and I'm thinking, man, this farmer  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:33:58):**  is going to get hammered in terms of yield. There's no way this organic field is going to yield.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:04):**  And yet what happens we would find was those conventional plants would grow very quickly  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:10):**  and then they would stall out. And then the, kind of like the tortoise and hare, so but the organic  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:16):**  plants they would grow slowly but they would eventually make it up to the same point in terms  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:22):**  of plant growth. And as I said, overall across these three pairs of farms that we looked at over  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:29):**  two years, we saw no difference in yield. This is really intriguing for me because  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:36):**  everything that we have been taught in mainstream agronomy is that you absolutely, it would be  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:44):**  absolute heresy to consider not applying soluble nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the furrow  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:51):**  at planting. And yet I have, we have a handful of growers that we've been working with for several  
**[0:34:57-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:34:57):**  years both directly within at AEA and then also some of the colleagues that I work with who insist  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:05):**  that they've been doing this for a number of years on applying only in-salt. So they still apply  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:12):**  an in-furrow application but there is no nitrogen, no phosphorus, or excuse me, I should say no soluble  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:19):**  phosphorus, only insoluble phosphorus in the rock phosphate form and no potassium and along with  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:26):**  calcium and magnesium and trace minerals. So they are applying an in-furrow solution but it does not  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:32):**  contain any appreciable quantities of NPK. And it's been really intriguing for me because these  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:39):**  growers, and I'm thinking of several corn producers in particular, have had the largest root systems  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:46):**  of any corn plants that I have ever observed. And when we were using SAP analysis, in spite of there  
**[0:35:52-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:52):**  being no phosphorus applications, these corn seedlings at a very early stage had higher phosphorus  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:35:59):**  concentrations than those areas where phosphorus was being applied. And I kind of suspected  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:06):**  that there was this microbial interaction going on that was contributing to that but I never  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:11):**  anticipated that it could be coined that and think of a response. It was absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah we did early on with these in this idea of biological buffering another study we did was when  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:25):**  we're growing plants in the conventional and organic soil with the different forms of

**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:37):**  interesting there is when we compared the the mineral profile of a leaf of a corn leaf in the  
**[0:36:44-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:44):**  from a conventional soil that had been given ammonium nitrate, it's nutrient profile  
**[0:36:53-0:37:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:36:53):**  was hugely different from a plant that received no fertilizer. But in the organics soils,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:02):**  when we grew plants there and we added either manure or ammonium nitrate, those mineral  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:09):**  profiles of those leaves were not that much different from the unamended plants. And again,  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:16):**  all of those plants grew very well and they were, it was not that they were all small,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:22):**  but they were all actually pretty large. And so that kind of gets back to this idea of the  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:29):**  buffering system. So even in the short term without the influx of soluble fertilizers in  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:37):**  that organic system with that active microbial food web, they can provide nutrients to the plant  
**[0:37:44-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:44):**  enough for it to grow as it needs to grow. You've looked at agriculture ecosystems  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:51):**  from a higher level, perhaps a more macro perspective. What is something that you believe  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:37:57):**  to be true about modern agriculture that is different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:03):**  Well I guess my maybe most heretical statement would be that I think that the use of soluble  
**[0:38:09-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:09):**  fertilizers has been one of the most disruptive practices for mainstream farming in terms of  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:18):**  looking at that soil, looking at that field, looking at that farm as an ecosystem. And for  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:23):**  many of the reasons we've already discussed here, we have another of the things that really struck  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:29):**  me as I started working with organic farmers was the difference in the way they viewed what they  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:36):**  did and whether they were successful or not. So for the organic farmer, let me start with the  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:42):**  conventional farmer, in terms of the way we've designed the farming system, it's much more  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:47):**  of what we would call a prescriptive approach where you have a problem and then you apply a  
**[0:38:53-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:38:53):**  product or you buy some material or you have some practice to solve that problem. And so it's  
**[0:39:01-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:01):**  reactive or anticipating a problem. Whereas in the organic system, it's a much more systems  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:09):**  perspective that these farmers were taking. And so they often didn't even know what their yields  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:17):**  were. They couldn't tell you what they were. All they knew was they had enough for their animals  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:23):**  and that their animals were healthy. And so they were looking at the whole system. So that was  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:27):**  their indicator that things were working well, that they had a good balance between their animals  
**[0:39:33-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:33):**  and their crop production, their forage production, whatever, and that the dairy cows were  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:42):**  producing well. So that was their metric. And so in that case, and this kind of gets back to  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:39:50):**  another difference in terms of the way maybe a more conventional agronomist would look at organic

**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:01):**  fertility system is so much of that nitrogen is tied up, would be the phrase that I would hear.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:08):**  Well, I don't see that as a negative. I see that actually as a positive when you think about this  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:14):**  over the long term, because yes, it's tied up in the sense that it's not immediately available to  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:21):**  the plant, not all of it's immediately available to the plant, but you've got money in the bank  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:26):**  there for the next year. And so the idea is to build as you're converting to maybe a more  
**[0:40:32-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:32):**  ecological approach or an organic system, you are building that bank account, if you will,  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:42):**  and so that now, I can extend the analogy, now that bank can start to give you interest,  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:49):**  and you can start to live on the interest rather than to be always living on the principle.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:40:55):**  Larry, what is a book or a resource that you would recommend that more growers and agronomists  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:02):**  should read or pay attention to?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:04):**  Oh boy. Well, I think there are a lot, like I say, there's been some great advances, I think,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:10):**  now in terms of organic research, and so I think there are a lot of books and some of them not,  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:19):**  some of them relatively small, but very informative books that have been put out  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:26):**  that are very practical in terms of talking about cover crops, talking about different  
**[0:41:34-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:34):**  sources of fertility, of organic fertility, and so I would recommend, you know, people maybe go to  
**[0:41:42-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:42):**  ATRA or ORFR or even the National Conservation Service. There's been a real shift in the attitude  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:41:58):**  of scientists in this regard, so like I say, when we first started, it was considered unscientific.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:03):**  Now people have recognized the observations of these pioneer farmers or farmers that really have  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:13):**  been our mentors and the mentors of some other scientists as well, and now have a better  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:20):**  understanding maybe of what's going on there and why these systems work. So I think there are a  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:25):**  number, I don't know that there's a specific book that I would point to, but yeah, a number of  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:30):**  books and guides are available now for organic fertility and organic soil management.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:39):**  You know, we have a lot of resources today that weren't available even five years ago.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:43):**  Yes. What is the question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:47):**  Well, I think you've done a pretty good job of covering. Maybe, I guess I'm, because it's so  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:53):**  recent and we're just finding some neat things out in these urban soils, if you know mine,  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:42:59):**  I'd like to talk a little bit about that. Please, look, learn more about what you're doing.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:04):**  Yeah, so the, you know, the idea is that in this, the work that we've done so far, we recognize that  
**[0:43:11-0:43:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:11):**  the importance of this soil community in terms of producing a healthy plant, right, and so  
**[0:43:19-0:43:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:19):**  now when we have this situation where this, the soil and these urban centers like Cleveland,  
**[0:43:26-0:43:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:26):**  where we have huge numbers of buildings being torn down, we have something like 20, 25,000  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:34):**  vacant lots now available in Cleveland, and we have all this open land that the city is looking  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:41):**  for ways to best utilize for the benefit of the community, and one of the possibilities I see is,  
**[0:43:47-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:47):**  is urban farming and bring healthy food into those neighborhoods, but if given that legacy of,  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:43:57):**  like I say, outfall from smokestacks and, and we know that the, in many areas there are elevated  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:05):**  levels of lead and other heavy metals, we wanted to know to what degree has that impacted,  
**[0:44:12-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:12):**  that legacy, has that impacted that soil community, and if we, if the community converted  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:19):**  some of these lots to food production and particularly using organic methods, could they  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:25):**  rejuvenate that soil to bring it back to create a healthy environment again, or are those soils  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:31):**  just lost and we should recommend that they just be planted to green space or something like that,  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:37):**  some other purpose other than farming, and so one of the, and so what we did, what we're doing is  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:43):**  comparing the various aspects, the chemical, the physical, and the biological community of these  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:49):**  soils from these vacant lots that have this insult of heavy metals and, and petroleum contaminants,  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:44:57):**  compare this to some organic farms in, in Cleveland, and then compare that to the  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:04):**  metro park soils, so these are soils that are kind of what we would consider the proxy for what the  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:10):**  community would have been like before Cleveland settled there and disturbed the soils, and then  
**[0:45:17-0:45:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:17):**  also rural organic farms, so we wanted to know do these, these organic urban farms, are they able to  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:25):**  improve the soils in the city and to, are they able to improve it to the degree that we see in  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:32):**  the rural setting, and we've found some really interesting things, for example, most striking,  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:41):**  and we haven't even published this yet, we've just, just found this out, and that with the influx of  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:48):**  organic matter in these organic farms, it's not only reducing the levels of lead that are in the  
**[0:45:55-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:45:55):**  soil there, but also the lead that is fit there, it's reducing the bioavailability of that lead,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:04):**  and so now we're real excited about that, and so this suggests maybe an avenue through which  
**[0:46:12-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:12):**  some of these cities can improve their soils and reduce the, the danger of lead in the soil by,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:22):**  you know, improve, increasing the amount of organic matter going in, and the type of organic  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:26):**  matter going in. So if you're able to effectively bioremediate lead and some of these other toxic  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:33):**  elements, and in essence what you're describing is that they're not being absorbed by the, the  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:40):**  plants, which is really powerful. That's correct, yeah, so that's, that's really, a lot of research  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:46):**  is moving in that direction, you know, because, you know, elements like lead, they're not going to  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:51):**  break down, you know, you can't get rid of them, they're going to be there, so somehow you've got  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:46:56):**  to pull them out, so you have to remove all that soil and bring in new soil, which obviously is  
**[0:47:01-0:47:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:01):**  extremely expensive, or you reduce the, the availability of it, and so you have to, you know,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:08):**  reduce the availability of it, and so in that case, if it's not available, you could, a human could  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:16):**  eat this material, this, this form of, say, lead, and it would just pass through the system without  
**[0:47:22-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:22):**  any harm to the human or to the animal or whatever, or to the plant for that matter. So yeah, that's  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:29):**  the way things are kind of moving towards trying to see, are there ways to reduce that  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:33):**  availability of that, those heavy metals, rather than actually try to remove them from the system.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:39):**  I think that actually can be a very important piece that we may need to consider, not just for  
**[0:47:46-0:47:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:47:46):**  the legacy of urban regions, but also we have many pollutants that have been applied in agricultural

**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:00):**  orchards was lead arsenic, and so we have that, we have that legacy in some agricultural soils of  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:07):**  having some fairly toxic elements in quite substantial concentrations that need to be  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:13):**  remediated. Yeah, I hadn't actually thought about that. That's, that's certainly true. That would be  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:17):**  interesting to look at. Absolutely. I think there's a very, there's a need for that, and for looking at  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:23):**  reclaiming some of these soils, and one of the pieces that we actually see quite a bit of, perhaps  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:29):**  more in orchards and regions where there were historical orchards than anywhere else, is the  
**[0:48:35-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:35):**  damaging impacts on soil biology of chronic pesticide use and pesticide exposure. So often,  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:43):**  when, when we talk about the, some of the potential damaging consequences of, say,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:50):**  glyphosate or certain fungicides or whatever it is we might be discussing, kind of the immediate  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:48:58):**  area that many people jump to is thinking about large-scale, broad-acre crop production, corn,  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:49:04):**  beans, small grains, and so forth. And certainly there is, there is substantial pesticide use in  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:49:10):**  some of those areas, although it's spread out over very large acres. But I think where it's  
**[0:49:14-0:49:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:49:14):**  highly concentrated is in these fruit production areas where orchards, and the same is true to some  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:49:21):**  degree of vegetable production as well, but orchards get chronic year after year applications  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/plant-and-insect-communications-in-biological-cropping-systems-with-larry-phelan/#t=0:49:26):**  of very intense herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide applications that we see having a

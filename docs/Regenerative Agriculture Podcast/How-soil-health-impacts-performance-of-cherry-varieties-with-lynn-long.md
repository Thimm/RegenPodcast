**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and

**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:02:53):**  to where you are today? Well, I think I'd have to go back to the early 1990s. At that time, for  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:02:59):**  those people that were in the sweet cherry industry, you know that most of the production  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:04):**  in the United States was focused on one single sweet cherry variety. And that variety, of course,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:11):**  was Bing. And we grew our cherries on one rootstock, and that rootstock was Mazard.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:17):**  And we used one training system, which was kind of an open base. We were starting to transition into a  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:25):**  training system that was developed by growers up in Washington State. That was called a steep  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:30):**  leader system. But, you know, there wasn't a lot of diversity in the sweet cherry industry at that  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:34):**  time. And in 1994, the cherry growers in the mid-Columbia area of Oregon, I worked for Oregon  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:42):**  State University, got together and sent me on a back-finding mission to Europe. And what I saw  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:49):**  over there changed the way that we farm cherry here in the United States. And so I think that  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:03:56):**  probably was the one thing that has transformed my work in the sweet cherry industry more than  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:03):**  anything else and has transformed the industry here in the United States more than anything else.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:09):**  What was the shift that happened? How did you begin managing trees differently?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:13):**  Well, so it was interesting. So back in the 1970s, I started working for Oregon State University in  
**[0:04:19-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:19):**  1988, 30 years ago. And prior to my starting my tenure with OSU, we were in the experiment  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:30):**  stations at Oregon State University and Washington State University. We were testing new cherry root  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:36):**  stocks. And so we were looking at some of them that had been developed in Europe, a series that  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:40):**  was developed in Oregon, but nobody was thinking about moving that from the experimental stage  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:46):**  into the commercial stage. Same thing was true for varieties, although with variety,  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:52):**  nobody was even looking at other options. We had Bing for blush variety, we had Rainier,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:04:58):**  and basically that was it. Nobody was looking any further than that. And the problem was that  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:03):**  if something happened to destroy your Bing crop the day before you were going to pick it,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:09):**  your entire income for that year was wiped out. If you had rain, for example, the day or a week  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:15):**  before you were going to pick the crop, you know, you lost your crop and you moved on to the next  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:20):**  year. And so there was good reasons for us to be looking at other varieties, but nobody was  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:26):**  thinking about it at that time. And when I went to Europe, what I saw was that growers in Germany,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:33):**  for example, were using dwarfing root stocks commercially. Growers in France were talking  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:38):**  about the pedestrian orchards, orchards that can be harvested from the ground without the use of  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:43):**  ladders. And our trees were, you know, 20, 25 feet tall, using big ladders to harvest our cherry.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:51):**  And they were using, in places like Germany and Spain and France and Italy, they were using  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:05:56):**  multiple varieties to harvest their cherries early, mid-season, and late, which also protected them  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:03):**  from events like rain, because the cherries may be more resistant to rain cracking, some varieties  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:10):**  more resistant than other varieties. Plus, if you get a rain early, your late season varieties are  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:15):**  still pickable. And so when I came back and started talking to growers about some of these things,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:21):**  and doing some research on these things, the training systems of varieties of root stocks,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:26):**  then all of a sudden the growers understood the need to move forward. And starting in the late  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:33):**  90s, there were some dramatic changes that happened in the cherry industry with all three  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:38):**  of these areas. When you think about each of these three areas, obviously, they're an entire  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:44):**  cultural management system that ties together, you have to use all three of these pieces together.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:50):**  One of the areas that I know many growers are becoming much more interested today is  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:06:56):**  understanding how to manage plant health with these newer systems. In some parts of the country,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:03):**  I've heard the conversation that many of the newer genetics and newer varieties, particularly  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:10):**  some of the dwarf root stocks, don't seem to have the root vigor and strength and the capacity to  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:16):**  absorb nutrients from the soil profile. I've not seen, we've observed some differences in various  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:24):**  varieties being able to pick up nutrients more effectively than others, but they've been fairly  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:28):**  slight. But I've never been able to compare with some of the older root stocks. How do you feel the  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:35):**  vigor of the modern dwarf root stocks compared to the vigor of some of the older varieties that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:40):**  were available? Yeah, well, one of the reasons why some of our growers still prefer the older  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:47):**  root stock, such as Mazard, which is a kind of a default root stock here in the Pacific Northwest  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:53):**  for cherry growers and has been for years and years, is because it's a root stock that  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:07:58):**  establishes itself well. It grows deep into the ground, so it pulls in nutrients from a wide  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:05):**  ranging area and it grows a vigorous tree that fills the space quite quickly. So some of the  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:12):**  dwarfing root stocks, there's a series out of Germany called the Giesler series, produced  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:18):**  dwarfing or semi-dwarfing trees, and their root stocks are also a lot more shallow.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:23):**  So you've got to be sure that the nutrients are delivered to the root zone for uptake by the tree.

**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:39):**  find by itself. And so you have to be thinking about these things a little bit more. You have  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:44):**  to be thinking about delivering the nutrients to where the tree is, whether you're doing it through  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:50):**  drip irrigation or a micro-sprinter system, because the tree is not going to be able to  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:08:56):**  send its roots down to an area that can find all the nutrients it might be able to,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:02):**  that it might need in order to remain strong and healthy.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:06):**  Earlier you and I spoke a little bit about looking at the other half of the tree.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:13):**  What do you think has been missing in, perhaps with varieties and genetic selection and also  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:17):**  cultural management in terms of looking at the upper half of the tree and not at what's happening  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:22):**  below the soil system?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah, so I think that this is one of the key areas that I think we're going to be moving in the future,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:31):**  because up to now we have been focusing our attention and our research and growers have  
**[0:09:37-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:37):**  been focusing their, most of their management on just half of the tree, just from the ground up.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:45):**  And you know, when we talk about a cherry tree, we talk about any type of a tree,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:50):**  but we're really talking about, at least what most people are thinking about is what they can see.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:09:55):**  But there's a whole world of what's happening under the soil that we don't think about,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:01):**  that we are not actively managing and we are not actively doing research on.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:07):**  Now there are some exceptions to that and I think that we're seeing more and more scientists  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:12):**  doing research on that part of the tree that is below ground, what's happening below ground,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:19):**  what are the micronutrients that are supporting the growth of the tree, what are the microbes  
**[0:10:25-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:25):**  and the fauna that is going through this entire life cycle underneath the soil that is causing  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:34):**  the tree to either be healthy or not to be healthy.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:38):**  And I think that growers too are starting to think about this more as a whole system  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:44):**  rather than just a half a system as we've been looking at this for decades and even  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:48):**  centuries. I think that's a really positive thing that is happening now, that more and  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:54):**  more growers are thinking about the entire tree and more and more scientists are thinking  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:10:59):**  about the entire tree and not just the above ground portion of the tree.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:03):**  Yeah, it's when you think about hormonal interactions and nutrient transport,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:09):**  nutrient absorption, etc., there's the root system plays a major part in the reproductive  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:15):**  potential and other pieces that are happening within the tree canopy. What are some of the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:20):**  things that you've observed that you started thinking about managing what's happening in  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:25):**  the soil profile?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:27):**  Well, when we are using these dwarfing rootstocks, a lot of them are fairly shallowly rooted  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:35):**  and so where you have a situation like what we have here in the Pacific Northwest, we  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:41):**  have a Mediterranean climate, the summers are very hot, our cherry industry in both  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:11:47):**  Oregon and Washington is on the east side of the Cascade Mountain range, which is a

**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:02):**  August, maybe even June, and you try to put a soil probe into the soil, it's like concrete.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:08):**  You can hardly get that soil probe to penetrate into that soil. And when you have dwarfing  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:16):**  rootstock and those roots are so shallow in the soil, you've got this soil that is so  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:24):**  hard and impenetrable that's got to be affecting the growth and behavior of the tree.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:31):**  Once we see that a couple of these rootstocks, Gisela 5 and Gisela 6, a couple of these  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:36):**  German rootstocks that I was mentioning earlier, when the temperatures get really hot, when  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:41):**  you get temperatures like 100 degrees or more, which happens several times a year in this  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:47):**  climate, the leaves look stressed, they look wilted and again that's got to be affecting  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:12:54):**  the quality of the fruit. The tree is going to try to protect itself and so it will take  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:01):**  moisture from wherever it can find it. It can't bring it up from the root zone in order to  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:05):**  counter the translocation that's taking place from the leaves. It's going to take it from  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:10):**  the fruit and that's got to affect fruit quality. So from there, I got to thinking about, you  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:15):**  know, there's got to be some way that we can protect this soil from the heat and from the  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:21):**  drying that takes place in the middle of the summer, maybe we should be thinking about  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:25):**  mulches. And then we thought that kind of developed into looking at compost and compost  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:32):**  molds mixtures. And from there, there's a lot that we don't know yet. But from there,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:38):**  we started realizing that if we can keep the soil friable and moist at the surface, then  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:46):**  there's a possibility that we can keep the microorganisms alive in that level of soil  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:13:54):**  throughout the entire year. And by doing that, that's got to affect the health of the entire  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:00):**  ecosystem, including the health of the tree. And so that's kind of, you know, my thought  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:07):**  processes over the last few years as we've been thinking about not only what's happening above  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:14):**  ground, but also in the entire ecosystem of the tree.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:19):**  What have you learned so far with the mulch and compost trials? What has stood out for you?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:25):**  Well, right now we are in the middle of a multi-year study. And we're just in the beginning  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:31):**  process of that study. So scientific data I can't share with you, but we know we certainly  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:37):**  have some observations where we have seen some orchards that have been struggling, have  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:43):**  turned around, leaves that were small and chlorotic have started to grow larger leaves,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:50):**  better color. And what's causing that, what's having that positive effect, we don't know  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:14:56):**  yet. I think that we are being successful at keeping the microorganisms alive throughout  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:05):**  the season, the summer season, as well as through the rest of the year. We're taking  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:10):**  some of the stress out of the tree by keeping the soil cooler. And so I think it's just  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:16):**  a whole positive change that is being made to the entire ecosystem of the tree. And not  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:25):**  just relying on the moisture that we've been giving them through the irrigation system,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:30):**  through the fertilizer that we've been applying to them. But now we're looking at, okay, how  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:37):**  do we add organic matter to the soil by using some of these organic mulches, organic compost?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:44):**  How does that affect the overall health of our trees? Those are some of the questions  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:49):**  that we have yet to answer. And like I mentioned earlier, scientists are just beginning to  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:15:55):**  look at some of these questions and get answers for them. But I'm happy to see that more and  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:02):**  more scientists are finally answering, asking these questions.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:06):**  Yeah, I think it's certainly interesting in a recent discussion, a microbiologist made  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:12):**  the point that in her estimation, we know less than 5% of what is going on in the soil

**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:23):**  don't understand very well. And we don't understand the full implications of how biology

**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:35):**  Yeah, that's exactly right. I just returned from Chile on Sunday, a couple days ago. I've  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:42):**  been working with some growers down there and encouraging them to use compost and mulches.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:49):**  Last year in Chile, they had a very heavy cherry crop to the point where some trees  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:16:54):**  weren't harvested, some blocks weren't harvested because the cherries were just

**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:10):**  that I saw there. Now that you got to remember that they harvest their cherries in December  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:16):**  and January. So now they're just going into the fall. So I was looking at trees that were  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:21):**  that were dormant, that were dropping their leaves or had dropped their leaves. Yet in  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:25):**  some of these trees that typically you would not have expected to see any growth because  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:30):**  the fruit load was so heavy in the tree. They had nice, long, vigorous shoots. And he attributed  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:36):**  that to the fact that he had been using compost and mulch through the year and that made that  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:42):**  kind of difference. Now, whether or not that was true or not, I can't say I don't have  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:46):**  any data to back that up. But I'm just relaying to you the observations and the comments that  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:53):**  the grower made to me.

**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:17:57):**  other oysters that we've worked with. In the work that you have done or the operations  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:02):**  that you have observed in your, I guess perhaps I'll just say in your life experience, what  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:07):**  has been something that surprised you?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:09):**  Well, I think that one of the things that has surprised me and yet I appreciate very  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:18):**  much about the grower community is that wherever I travel in the world, cherry growers are  
**[0:18:24-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:24):**  willing to share ideas with each other. Occasionally you find somebody who, you know, doesn't want  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:33):**  to think that they have all the secrets and they don't want to share those secrets with  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:39):**  anybody else. But for the most part, wherever I've traveled in the world, growers have been  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:43):**  willing to share ideas and share what they're doing with other growers, with scientists.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:48):**  And I think that's just a really nice thing about this industry. We have growers from  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:18:55):**  all over the world that come here and our growers are willing to invite them into their

**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:07):**  on. And, you know, that's just really nice to be a part of that type of industry that  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:13):**  is open and is willing to share ideas, but also receive ideas from other people. And  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:20):**  I think that's one of the reasons why the cherry industry has advanced so much in the  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:24):**  last 20 years.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:26):**  I think you've just identified a very key piece when what we have observed and what  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:32):**  I've observed around the countryside is the growers who are the most willing to share  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:39):**  ideas are also the same growers. I guess perhaps the simplest way to say it is that you receive  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:45):**  in the same measure that you give, you share ideas, you share information with other growers,  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:49):**  almost invariably you learn things that can help you on your operation as well. And I  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:54):**  would agree with you that that is something that is very pronounced in the agriculture  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:19:58):**  space in general and very valuable.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:00):**  Yeah. And I think that the, and I guess I would encourage growers, professionals that  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:05):**  are listening to this, I think the more travelling you can do to see what's happening around  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:09):**  the world, you know, I started off by talking about how that one trip to Europe back in  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:14):**  1994 changed an entire industry in the Northwest and really throughout the entire country.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:21):**  And since then, there's been a lot of our growers that have gone to other parts of the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:28):**  world and a lot of growers from places like Australia and Chile and Argentina and even  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:32):**  from Europe that have come here and just look at what we're doing and we look at what they're  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:39):**  doing and the grower community is really a very hospitable community. And I've seen it  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:46):**  where they've, you know, they've invited people to come, they've had barbecues for people,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:51):**  they share ideas, and really it's the same with the scientific community as well. I'll  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:20:56):**  go up to Canada and visit research stations up there, they'll come down here, I'll go  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:01):**  to Germany or I'll go to Australia and visit with their scientists and they come here and  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:08):**  visit with us and this is how we advance, this is how we move forward and we learn from  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:15):**  each other, we learn what doesn't work, we learn what they're doing that has worked,

**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:27):**  only way that we advance. Exactly. One of the pieces that I've observed which I find  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:32):**  really intriguing is everyone has a unique perspective on the work that they're doing  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:39):**  and the things that are happening in the world around them and along those lines one of the  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:45):**  questions that I'd have for you is what is something that you believe to be true about  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:50):**  modern agriculture that is perhaps a different perspective from the mainstream? I think that  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:21:56):**  probably the most important thing we've already talked about, I think the mainstream  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:02):**  agriculture has focused on, as we mentioned, just half of the tree, half of the plant and  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:09):**  I think that what is true is that there is a lot more that's going on out there than  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:16):**  what we realize. What that is, we're just starting to learn but there is much more happening  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:24):**  below the soil surface than we've ever thought of before, we've ever realized before.

**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:37):**  about the irrigation needs of the tree, about the fertilizer needs of the tree, about putting  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:43):**  on foliar fertilizers, whatever that might be but there is so much more to growing the tree  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:49):**  than we have understood up to now and there's a whole world out there of science that we're  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:22:56):**  just beginning to penetrate. I think that if we look forward in the next 20 years, I think that  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:03):**  the changes from now, the next 20 years are going to be just as dramatic as the changes that happened

**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:13):**  to be in a different area, it's going to be from the ground down and not from the ground up like  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:20):**  we focused on previously. Those are some fascinating and intriguing comments. I guess the

**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:34):**  below the soil differently, how might that influence or change the way we manage what

**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:47):**  I think that there may be issues that we are struggling with now that may become minor issues  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:23:54):**  in the future and what I'm thinking of is if you've ever grown any prunus species trees like

**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:25:57):**  Dr. Robert Mutter Yeah, I, well actually I have a follow-up

**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:26:07):**  root system begins changing, if we develop a much, perhaps I'll say a much more aggressive root

**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:26:39):**  around that? Dr. Michael Smith  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:26:40):**  Yeah, I think that anytime you have a healthier root system that is exploring a wider area,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:26:48):**  it means that the nutrients that that tree needs are more readily available,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:26:53):**  that the moisture that that tree needs is more readily available, even in times when we have

**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:28:27):**  of the tree, but down the bottom of the tree it can be difficult sometimes. But if we have that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:28:33):**  root system working for us because the microorganisms are working for us, then we're

**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:28:48):**  observed is that as nutrition management practices change, growers are able to get that consistent  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:28:55):**  growth, but also to get very high quality growth with tight internode spacing. And I think there  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:02):**  are many ways that nutrition and biology and genetics, they all tie together and they need  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:07):**  to be managed. You mentioned the key word several times, which is we're really managing an entire  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:13):**  ecosystem. We can't just manage one aspect of it. We have to manage the entire ecosystem.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, we need to be looking at the entire ecosystem and not just a  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:24):**  portion of the ecosystem. I understand your hesitation around speaking about some of the,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:30):**  I know that we've worked together on some orchards where we've seen some interesting  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:34):**  things around bacterial canker. And so I'll just mention them briefly. One farm that we've worked  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:40):**  on, and when I say we, I'm referring to advancing eco agriculture, where the incidence of bacterial  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:45):**  canker has been greatly reduced, I think, to the point where now after several years, we can say  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:50):**  that it seems to have been eliminated on a couple of blocks. And many growers have asked the  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:29:56):**  question, what did you do? And what happened? What was the what product did you use? And the answer,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:03):**  as Lynn has pointed out so well, is that we don't know, we worked with nutrition products,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:08):**  we worked with biological products, and we tried to manage that ecosystem. And as the ecosystem  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:13):**  changed, then bacterial canker pressure changed. And we can't point to one thing and say that we  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:19):**  did one thing that made a difference. So I agree with you that there is, there seems to be the  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:24):**  potential to shift that disease in particular, and perhaps others as well, which would be really  
**[0:30:30-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:30):**  exceptional.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:31):**  Yeah, bacterial canker is a disease that is pretty relentless. Once it gets into the tree,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:38):**  occasionally, you'll find that a canker will dry up and will not progress any further. But more  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:46):**  typically, much more typically is that that canker once it's established will continue to grow and  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:51):**  grow and expand, and eventually either kill part of the tree or all the tree. And so when this  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:30:59):**  grower approached me, and you know, he mentioned that he was having a severe infection with  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:05):**  bacterial canker, well, you think about all your, your common remedies for bacterial canker, which  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:12):**  in like I say, there's, there's really no very effective chemical that you can apply on that  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:18):**  tree that is going to stop an infection once it's taken place. There's really nothing you can help  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:24):**  prevent infections using some products, one in particular would be copper, but even that's not  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:31):**  all that effective. And so when I saw this, there was there was lots of infection, strikes all over  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:39):**  these trees. And it really did not bode well for the for the future of that block. And then they  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:46):**  started to, you know, do some of these things we've been talking about using compost and mulches,  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:51):**  mulches in that, in that orchard and using some of the AEA products. And again, as I've mentioned  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:31:57):**  before, we can't point a finger to any scientific data that says this turned it around. All we have  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:05):**  is observations. But after the first year, he came back to me, he said, you know, those,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:11):**  those cankers have dried up. And this was in the summertime. And I'm thinking, Okay, yeah,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:15):**  they don't look like they're progressing any further. But these cankers do go dormant in the  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:21):**  summertime. Let's see what they look like in the fall, what they look like in the spring. And we'll  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:27):**  make a better assessment that time. Well, the next the next spring came around in the next summer.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:32):**  And they, they hadn't progressed, they had, they had stopped in. And for two or three years,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:38):**  I went back to that block and continue to look at it. And I saw no more events of that,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:44):**  of that disease. The oozing that comes about as a result of that disease from the sap coming out  
**[0:32:50-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:50):**  out of the tree, it totally stopped, the infections had dried up. It was was pretty  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:32:59):**  remarkable, and quite untypical of what we would have expected for cherry orchard commercial cherry  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:06):**  orchard that was so badly infected. That's very exciting and inspiring. And it's something that  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:12):**  we need to work to try to understand better and then try to replicate because there's so much that  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:17):**  we don't know about how these bacterial populations of soil profile can impact tree health.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:24):**  There's still a lot of homework to be done for sure. What is a what is a book or resource that  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:29):**  you would recommend to growers most often? There's a new cherry book that has just come out in the  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:36):**  last year. They replaced one that was published in the 1990s. And so this is a this is an updated  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:43):**  version of that book called Cherries Botany Production and Uses. And the publisher is CABI,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:51):**  C-A-B-I. It's been written by cherry scientists all over the world. And so there's everything  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:33:58):**  that you ever wanted to know about cherries and a whole lot more that are included in this book.

**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:05):**  future looks like? What are the big drivers that you see emerging? Well, I think that you're right,

**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:17):**  deal with in the future, and we're starting to deal with it right now, and have for the last  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:21):**  decade or so, is labor shortage, general labor shortage in agriculture. A lot of our labor in our  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:29):**  commercial cherry orchards in the United States are Mexican laborers. And these are people that  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:35):**  are extremely hard working people that come, some of them live here in the cherry industry  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:42):**  regions year round, some of them come up from California or other places and pick our cherries.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:48):**  We've got the best cherry pickers in the world. And I say that with no hesitation. There's no  
**[0:37:56-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:37:56):**  other region in the world that can even come close to harvesting cherry trees as efficiently  
**[0:38:05-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:05):**  and as quickly as our cherry pickers that we use here in the Pacific Northwest and actually the  
**[0:38:13-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:13):**  entire West Coast area of the nation. But there are new opportunities that are coming to the  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:21):**  Mexican laborers that we have relied on for so many decades. They're going into manufacturing,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:27):**  construction, they're looking for other opportunities. Their children are not  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:31):**  necessarily wanting to get into agriculture. And of course, all the border issues are affecting  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:38):**  the industry as well. And so I think that one of the few hurdles that we've got to overcome here  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:44):**  in the next relatively few years is how are we going to get our cherries off of the trees with  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:49):**  a shortage of labor. And one of the things that we've been looking at are ways of mechanically  
**[0:38:54-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:38:54):**  harvesting cherries. We have looked at developing new training systems that will allow the cherries  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:02):**  to fall off of the trees without impacting other branches and getting damaged in that way.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:09):**  We've looked at breeding cherries that have a weak stem attachment. When you shake the tree  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:16):**  or when you strike the tree with a plunger or a piston, the cherries will readily drop from  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:22):**  the trees. And we've also looked at the acceptance of stem-free cherries by the consumer.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:29):**  Will the consumer accept a cherry that does not have a stem? And what we found  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:35):**  when we've done some market analysis is that, yes, for the most part, consumers will accept  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:41):**  that as a product, but there may be some advantages to a stem-free cherry. And so I really think  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:49):**  that in the not too distant future, this is one of the directions that the industry will have  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:39:58):**  to take. And I think that we are already looking for some solutions to these problems,  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:03):**  and it's not too far in the future.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:06):**  Leland, when you visualize an orchard of the future in 20 years from now, what does that orchard  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:14):**  look like to you in your mind, Dan?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:16):**  So I think that we're going to be moving away from freestanding trees. You know, if you have  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:22):**  ever seen a cherry tree growing in the backyard, you know that it's a mass of branches. It's tall.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:29):**  There are branches that go one way, branches that go another way. We've got to simplify  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:34):**  that architecture. We've got to train those branches to go exactly where we want them to go.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:42):**  And so through some work done by Dr. Matt Whiting of Washington State University, Dr. Greg Lang  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:48):**  of Michigan State University, they've developed a training system that is called an upright fruiting  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:40:54):**  offshoots training system that basically is a trellis system that comes up from the ground.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:01):**  This is the wide trellis. So it comes up from the ground, and then it comes out two different angles  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:08):**  that allow the light to come down from the top and allows cherries, if they are being grown  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:14):**  on this system, to drop freely to a platform without impacting other branches. And so I think  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:21):**  that the orchard in the future will have a system developed something like this, where we will go  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:29):**  into that orchard with a machine that will strike the tree, the cherries will drop from the tree,  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:36):**  and then go directly into a bin from that point and then be taken to the packing house. This is a  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:42):**  huge advancement just in the last 10 years. Most of the packing houses now are optically sorted.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:49):**  So for every cherry that goes over the line, they're going over at a speed that you can barely  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:41:54):**  see but multiple pictures are being taken of that cherry. And those cherries that have defects are  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:42:01):**  being thrown out, those cherries that are softer than what you would want are being thrown out. And  
**[0:42:07-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:42:07):**  so in this way, we are able to continue to produce high quality fruit for the consumers without as  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:42:16):**  much labor as we've had in the past, where that labor is not going to be available in the future.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-soil-health-impacts-performance-of-cherry-varieties-with-lynn-long/#t=0:42:23):**  And so we're having to adapt significantly. And all of this has been made possible by going back

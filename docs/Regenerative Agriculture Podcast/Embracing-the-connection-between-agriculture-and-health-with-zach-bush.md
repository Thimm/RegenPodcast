**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:01):**  Welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:04):**  Mostly on this podcast, we focus on solutions.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:09):**  That is not coming from a place of necessarily desiring  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:11):**  to avoid the problems or avoid having a conversation  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:14):**  about the problems, but simply coming from the place  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:17):**  that I believe it's much more powerful to be for something  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:20):**  than it is to be against something.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:22):**  About a decade ago, I spent a lot of time studying  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:26):**  and talking about the challenges of pesticides  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:30):**  in our environment, how they were impacting  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:33):**  the soil microbiome, how they were impacting human health.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:36):**  Since then, it's not a conversation  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:38):**  that I've had very much or one that I've already spent  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:41):**  a lot of time talking about or thinking about,  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:43):**  because again, I believe it's more powerful  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:45):**  to be focusing on the solutions.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:48):**  Yet in the last couple of years,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:50):**  actually within the last couple of months,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:52):**  I've had lots of questions of people trying to understand  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:55):**  why is glyphosate really a bad deal?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:58):**  So in this conversation, I'm very honored  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:01):**  to have Zach Bush here with us today.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:03):**  We will be starting this discussion  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:06):**  by describing some of the challenges  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:10):**  that really are happening in our agricultural landscapes  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:13):**  with the use of pesticides and with glyphosate in particular.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:17):**  And then we do want to also shift the conversation  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:20):**  to focusing on the possibilities, the opportunities,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:24):**  the potential to really shift and change  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:26):**  and produce a much different outcome.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:28):**  So Zach, thank you very much for joining us.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:31):**  I've been looking forward to this conversation.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:33):**  I'd love to hear your perspective.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:36):**  Really, let's start with glyphosate  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:39):**  and let's start with pesticides.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:41):**  Why is glyphosate damaging?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:45):**  Excellent, happy to be on with you, John.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:47):**  You've been a force to be reckoned with in this whole space,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:50):**  bringing great resources, consulting expertise,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:53):**  and real assets in the form of regenerative inputs  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:58):**  to the entire community of the US and beyond.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:02):**  So thank you for your hard work over the last decades.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:05):**  And my entry into the glyphosate world was very indirect.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:09):**  My background as a medical doctor  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:11):**  was in chemotherapy development, areas of expertise  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:15):**  in endocrinology and metabolism, internal medicine,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:17):**  hospital-based care, as well as outpatient management  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:20):**  of hormone disorders, got involved in chemotherapy  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:24):**  and cancer research, as that was where the money was at  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:27):**  in academia that could fund my meager salary  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:31):**  as a academic teacher there.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:33):**  But it was an interesting timeframe  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:36):**  because the world of cancer was changing  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:39):**  in that the age-old belief that this was a genetic injury  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:42):**  and a genetic predisposition was really transforming rapidly  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:47):**  in the 2005 kind of timeframe  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:49):**  where we were starting to get incredible amount  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:51):**  of genomic data suggesting that gut microbiome,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:55):**  the bacteria and fungi living within us were predicting  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:59):**  whether or not cancer would occur.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:00):**  In fact, could even predict what type of cancers  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:03):**  could occur depending on what types of perturbations  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:06):**  were in that microbiome ecosystem.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:10):**  And so that was really disruptive to our understanding  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:13):**  and status quo of cancer research and cancer physiology.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:17):**  And in that journey, started working  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:20):**  with vitamin A compounds and finding  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:22):**  that these nutritional elements were having a huge impact  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:25):**  on the ability of cancer cells to remove themselves  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:28):**  from the body and it's called a process called apoptosis  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:32):**  or programmed cell suicide.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:33):**  So it was a very exciting time to realize  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:36):**  that maybe there was a future for cancer management  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:38):**  where we weren't poisoning tumors,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:39):**  but we're actually giving them nutrients  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:42):**  that would increase their capacity for cell-cell signaling  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:45):**  and induction of apoptosis or programmed cell suicide  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:49):**  to clean up the cancer independent  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:51):**  of the human immune system  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:52):**  or other elements of human biology.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:54):**  And so it was really an exciting potential  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:57):**  transformative moment.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:59):**  And in that, we saw the big recession happen in 2008  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:03):**  and academia really collapsed.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:05):**  Our division of endocrinologist went from 75 faculty  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:08):**  down to about 25 over a very short period of time.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:11):**  And pharmaceutical companies grabbed up most of that talent.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:14):**  I ended up departing university at that time  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:18):**  and started a nutrition center for reversing chronic disease  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:21):**  and that's how I found my way into this topic of glyphosate  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:25):**  that you're asking about.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:26):**  So from that medical standpoint,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:28):**  I was looking at small chemicals as the solution  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:31):**  for many, many years.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:32):**  And when we started working with small compounds  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:35):**  made by bacteria and fungi in the soil and the gut,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:39):**  it was alarming to find out that these bacteria and fungi  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:42):**  could actually make medicine.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:44):**  They could make things that could repair the human body.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:46):**  And in the end, we found that the biggest thing  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:49):**  that they were in opposition to  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:51):**  was this chemical glyphosate that you mentioned.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:54):**  And glyphosate has now recognized worldwide  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:58):**  as being kind of a flashpoint of controversy  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:01):**  with a huge multi-billion dollar agricultural system  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:05):**  continuing to insist to regulatory bodies around the world  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:07):**  that this is a safe compound.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:09):**  Their old cash term was of course safer than water.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:12):**  This mentality of this can kill weeds  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:15):**  but somehow doesn't kill people was an alchemy  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:18):**  we couldn't figure out in the soil and plant system.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:21):**  How does a plant take these chemicals of herbicides  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:25):**  and pesticides that are killing bacteria and fungi  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:28):**  and beyond and then suddenly turn them  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:31):**  into benign compounds?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:33):**  And the way in which that was justified to the world  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:36):**  was through suggesting that the mechanism of glyphosate  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:39):**  in regards to its weed killing power was through blocking  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:44):**  an enzyme pathway called the shikimate pathway.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:46):**  And the unique thing about this is it doesn't exist  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:49):**  in humans, it doesn't exist in any animal out there.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:52):**  And so this was told to us as the rationale  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:55):**  for why this chemical could kill plants, fungi,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:58):**  and bacteria but wouldn't hurt your livestock  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:02):**  or your pet or your children  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:04):**  was because we didn't have this enzyme pathway  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:05):**  that was its target.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:07):**  And so that was how I think it was justified  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:09):**  through the system but what we weren't recognizing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:12):**  by that very story was that glyphosate was blocking  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:15):**  an enzyme pathway, the shikimate pathway  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:18):**  that was crucial to the health of humanity  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:21):**  and animal life that's consuming the plants  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:23):**  that have been treated with this chemical.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:26):**  And what it's doing is undermining the ability  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:29):**  for bacteria, fungi, and plants to produce  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:32):**  the aromatic amino acids.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:34):**  These are a portion of the essential amino acids.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:37):**  Recall that there's 22 amino acids  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:40):**  that build the human body and of those 22,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:44):**  there are nine that we call essential amino acids  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:46):**  that cannot be manufactured by the human body  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:48):**  because we lack the enzyme pathways.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:50):**  And some of those nine are represented  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:53):**  in these essential amino acids made  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:55):**  through the shikimate pathway.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:57):**  If Monsanto was right, this was the only way  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:59):**  that this toxin worked, perhaps there wasn't  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:02):**  a direct target towards human health  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:03):**  if that was the limitation of its effect  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:06):**  but there was certainly an indirect effect  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:08):**  that would occur if we started growing all of our food  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:10):**  under the pressure of a chemical that blocked  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:13):**  the ability of that food to make the essential protein  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:15):**  building blocks that our body can't produce.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:18):**  And so that was the beginning of a real destructive quality  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:21):**  to this thing as it undermined the building blocks  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:24):**  for proteins across all biology and certainly kills weeds  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:29):**  quickly for eliminating those essential amino acids  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:31):**  and subsequently we start to develop deficiencies  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:34):**  as human beings in essential amino acids  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:37):**  produced by the microbiome of the soils  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:39):**  and ultimately a reduction in our microbiome  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:42):**  as just like it does in soil,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:44):**  the residues of glyphosate in our food and water systems  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:47):**  are now ingested and killing, acting as an antibiotic  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:51):**  to the microbiome of our gut  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:52):**  and so we become deficient there.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:54):**  And so we are really undermining the health of soils  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:58):**  and gut performance in humans, animals,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:01):**  and all the way down to the earthworm  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:03):**  with this disruption of an antibiotic  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:06):**  that's now infused into our system.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:08):**  You've described this indirect effect of glyphosate  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:12):**  limiting the synthesis of these essential amino acids  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:15):**  that we require and that animals require.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:16):**  How does glyphosate impact our bodies directly if at all?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:20):**  Yeah, so this is what was not told to us  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:23):**  by the chemical companies,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:25):**  but our laboratory has been working on it  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:26):**  for the last eight years is that  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:29):**  what is the direct consequences of Roundup  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:31):**  in the human biology?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:32):**  And it turns out it very rapidly destroys protein structure  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:37):**  in the extracellular matrix  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:39):**  as well as in the intracellular system  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:41):**  and that has huge consequences for everything  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:44):**  from the way in which cells feed themselves,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:47):**  the metabolism of fuel,  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:48):**  all the way down to detoxification and repair  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:51):**  and regeneration systems within the cell,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:53):**  specifically the mitochondria within those cells  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:56):**  which are like little bacteria  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:57):**  that are capable of producing energy for the human cell.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:00):**  Those are also influenced by the toxicity  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:03):**  of this antimicrobial.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:05):**  And so the mitochondria within us  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:06):**  and the bacteria and fungi that support human cellular life  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:10):**  throughout the whole organ system of the body  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:13):**  is now recognized to be a direct target for glyphosate.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:16):**  And so when it starts to denature the proteins  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:19):**  in your gut lining, for example,  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:21):**  you start to develop a leak  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:23):**  and the proteins function sort of like Velcro  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:26):**  holding one epithelial cell, boundary cell

**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:33):**  that is the largest surface area

**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:37):**  It's two tennis courts in the surface area.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:39):**  And that gut lining made up of billions of epithelial cells

**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:59):**  or this slippery slope

**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:06):**  that the higher the concentrations of glyphosate

**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:17):**  In the United States,

**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:21):**  which collects about 80, 85% of the water soluble residues  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:25):**  of Roundup and the last 90 miles of that Mississippi River  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:30):**  running between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:32):**  is called cancer alley,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:34):**  highest rates of cancer in the entire developed world.

**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:40):**  of not just destroying the microbiome and its support,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:44):**  but then destroying the self identity  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:46):**  of the human or animal in that it loses that boundary event,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:51):**  what's inside, what's outside and the like.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:54):**  You mentioned glyphosate as an antibiotic  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:56):**  and the impact that it has on the microbiome.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:59):**  We know that it's patented as an antibiotic of course.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:01):**  What are the concentrations that are required  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:03):**  to have this effect on our microbiome?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah, the concentrations can be quite small.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:10):**  So you're down in the two parts per billion  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:13):**  to five parts per billion levels.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:15):**  And this is what you would typically see  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:17):**  in a lot of water systems around the country and the like.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:20):**  At a thousand fold that concentration,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:23):**  you're up in the two parts per million  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:24):**  to 20 parts per million.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:25):**  That's what you're commonly seeing on root vegetables  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:29):**  and other conventionally grown crops out there.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:31):**  Beets can be as high as 20 parts per million  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:34):**  in the grocery store.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:35):**  And so you're a thousand fold the detectable level of damage  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:39):**  once you're at the grocery store.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:41):**  If you get into livestock feed and pet food,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:45):**  you're now often in the 400 parts per million  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:48):**  or even thousand parts per million of glyphosate.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:50):**  And so you're up many hundred thousand times  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:53):**  that of its lowest threshold for damage.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:56):**  And so certainly functioning as an antibiotic,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:59):**  it doesn't take much to disrupt the ecosystem balance.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:03):**  Functioning as a disruptor of protein structures,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:06):**  you're down in that conventional vegetable range  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:08):**  is plenty to create that leaky membrane effect.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:12):**  The focus for the last few years  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:14):**  has really been on glyphosate as a molecule,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:17):**  but I think we also need to ask the question,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:19):**  what about the adjuvants that it is associated with  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:21):**  and not just the adjuvants that glyphosate  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:24):**  is associated with,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:25):**  but the broad array of other pesticides  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:29):**  that are routinely used in agricultural ecosystems.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:32):**  What is glyphosate being singled out?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:35):**  Is glyphosate so much worse than other pesticides?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:38):**  How is it different from others that are in the environment?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:42):**  I think that's an important question  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:43):**  because it's in this 30 year journey  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:46):**  with Roundup and glyphosate.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:47):**  I think we've really had to come to terms with the fact  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:49):**  that we were judging toxicity by a very narrow definition.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:54):**  And so Roundup came on the scene in the mid 1970s  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:58):**  to replace chemicals like atrazine  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:00):**  that were known carcinogens,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:02):**  very damaging to respiratory systems.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:04):**  There was a sense of, oh, this is the newer, safer compound.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:07):**  And so regulatory committees around the world  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:09):**  raced to get this thing approved  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:11):**  because it worked so effectively  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:12):**  and was so much less toxic  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:14):**  in our current understanding of that word.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:16):**  The reason why atrazine looks more toxic  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:18):**  is because it can do direct cellular damage to membranes.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:21):**  It can do direct damage to DNA and all of that kind of stuff.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:25):**  So it kind of fits our more classic model of cancer  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:28):**  and carcinogenic features to it.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:30):**  In contrast, in the 1970s,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:32):**  we had no idea that the microbiome  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:34):**  was actually at the real foundation of cancer.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:36):**  We thought it was direct DNA damage  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:38):**  that was doing cancer risk.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:40):**  And so we didn't understand at the time  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:42):**  that we were really undermining biological life  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:44):**  by switching from an atrazine direct toxin  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:47):**  to this indirect antimicrobial disruptor  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:51):**  of amino acid building blocks  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:53):**  and all these kind of long-term indirect features  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:55):**  that we wouldn't really discover  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:56):**  until a generation into the journey.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:59):**  And generation is measured by about 23, 25 years.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:03):**  And so by 25 years in that journey,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:06):**  we're hitting year 2000,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:07):**  and we suddenly realized that we were in an epidemic  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:10):**  of autoimmune disease that had really kicked up  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:11):**  by 1996, 98.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:14):**  We were in an epidemic of neurologic disorder in children  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:16):**  with a huge rise in autism,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:18):**  attention deficit hyperactivity disorders,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:20):**  sleeping disorders, mood disorders in children,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:23):**  anxiety and depression disorders.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:25):**  The whole gamut was going crazy by that one generation in.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:30):**  And we now know from generational mouse studies  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:33):**  that there is a cumulative epigenetic effect to this injury,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:37):**  meaning that if you injure generation one  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:40):**  with a small amount of Roundup injected under the skin,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:43):**  just a little pocket of it,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:44):**  there's no measurable damage to that mouse.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:47):**  They go on to have normal pups,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:48):**  they go on to have a normal lifespan.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:50):**  However, generation two, not exposed to Roundup,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:53):**  but came from mom who was exposed to Roundup,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:56):**  has significant issues with metabolic disorders,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:59):**  immune dysfunction, and has shortened lifespan.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:03):**  The third generation, again, not exposed directly,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:06):**  but indirectly to grandma now,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:09):**  that indirect grandmother epigenetic pattern  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:12):**  is now manifesting cancers and stillbirths  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:15):**  in that third generation.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:16):**  So there's this really terrifying cumulative effect  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:20):**  that happens generationally from this exposure to Roundup.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:24):**  And so I'm very concerned that we're heading  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:26):**  into the third generation of children under Roundup  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:30):**  just in the next five years.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:31):**  And so in the next five years,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:32):**  I think we're gonna see the real epidemic declare itself  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:36):**  in its full potential as we move from 2025 to 2035.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:41):**  And currently we're already in an exponential growth  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:44):**  of these chronic conditions in children.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:47):**  We've gone from an average of 1.5% of children  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:51):**  with a chronic disease in the 1960s  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:53):**  before the advent of Roundup to our current situation  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:57):**  where 52% of children in the United States  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:59):**  screened by Medicaid surveys  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:01):**  are now with a chronic disease.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:03):**  And so we have this devastating impact on human health  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:08):**  in what is certainly the most advanced  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:11):**  and most expensive medical system in the world.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:13):**  We are not succeeding in preventing this level of disease  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:17):**  within our children.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:18):**  We're literally building entire cities.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:20):**  Texas Children's Hospital in Houston,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:22):**  good example of this is skyscrapers on skyscrapers  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:27):**  on skyscrapers, literally tower after tower  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:30):**  of Children's Hospital housing our kids with cancer  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:33):**  and severe autoimmune diseases  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:35):**  and all of these horrible conditions.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:37):**  And so if we're building cities to house our sick children  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:40):**  and not getting at the realization of what we've done,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:43):**  we've got a real state of denial.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:45):**  And unfortunately that's very much  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:47):**  what I think we have at the regulatory level.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:49):**  You've made the comment that we're on track to go extinct  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:52):**  as a species in the next 70 years.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:54):**  What was the basis for that comment?  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:56):**  Was it additional factors other than just glyphosate  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:59):**  or specifically glyphosate?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:01):**  I would say glyphosate is public enemy number one  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:04):**  in that it's been our widest spread antibiotic  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:07):**  on the planet.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:08):**  We now know that human life is dependent upon  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:10):**  a diverse microbiome ecosystem of fungi and bacteria,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:14):**  parasites, protozoa, the whole spectrum.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:17):**  We need all of those guys for healthy soil,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:19):**  healthy plants, healthy life.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:21):**  And we've undermined that with this most ubiquitous  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:24):**  of chemicals now.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:25):**  We're somewhere around four billion pounds  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:28):**  of this chemical used worldwide every year now.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:31):**  The amount used globally has roughly doubled every six years

**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:41):**  in this antimicrobial pressure that has devastated  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:44):**  the health of our livestock,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:45):**  has devastated the health of our children,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:47):**  and has certainly devastated the health of the planet.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:50):**  The 70 year estimate is actually very specific,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:53):**  not just to the rise of chronic disease,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:56):**  which to give a sense of it,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:59):**  where we're heading for 2035 right now  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:01):**  is that one in three children in the United States  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:03):**  will have an autism spectrum disorder.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:05):**  And so if you start to then map that forward,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:08):**  what is the productivity of that generation  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:10):**  that has one in three children on the spectrum?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:12):**  What is the cost of care to that generation?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:15):**  What is the lost productivity of their parents  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:18):**  and grandparents and aunts and uncles  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:19):**  that are trying to contribute to daycare  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:22):**  and in-home care and the cost of institutional care?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:26):**  It just starts to, you realize,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:28):**  even with that one condition,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:30):**  we could completely destroy the economy of the United States  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:33):**  through just healthcare costs.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:34):**  Then you add in 80% of adults with cancer by 2035,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:38):**  and you realize we've got a completely  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:40):**  insoluble state of health.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:42):**  All of that said, that's not really how you map out  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:45):**  the prediction of extinction.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:46):**  For extinction, you need to undermine fertility.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:49):**  And that's what we've done simultaneous.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:51):**  So since the advent of glyphosate,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:54):**  and again, as you've said,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:56):**  there's many different chemicals and radiation exposures,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:59):**  cell phones, cell phone towers,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:01):**  as well as Bluetooth devices in this coming 5G era  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:06):**  and everything else.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:07):**  There's certainly many, many things  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:09):**  that are disrupting biologic function.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:11):**  And so we can look at that as a cohesive toxic stew,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:14):**  if you will, and then look at its impact on fertility.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:18):**  And in the United States and other Western countries,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:20):**  we've seen a decline between 52% and 57% in sperm counts  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:25):**  in males over that period of time,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:27):**  so since the mid 1970s.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:29):**  And so with a 52 to 57% decline in sperm counts,  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:33):**  we now have one in three males in Western countries  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:35):**  that are infertile due to a lack of production of sperm.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:39):**  That's an extraordinary statistic,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:41):**  one in three males now infertile.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:42):**  And then you look across to the female biology  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:45):**  and you find that it's nearly the identical number.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:48):**  You've got one in four women that are affected  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:50):**  with just the condition of polycystic ovarian syndrome,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:53):**  and then you have a whole host of other conditions  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:55):**  that contribute to the additional women  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:57):**  to reach this kind of one in three  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:59):**  with infertile or poor fertility state.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:02):**  And so those are the numbers that as you extrapolate them  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:04):**  out with the rising curves of toxicity in the soils  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:08):**  and more importantly, perhaps for our survival,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:11):**  the toxicity of our oceans and water systems,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:14):**  you start to realize we've got about eight years  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:16):**  before we tip off to a crisis level of biology  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:20):**  within water and soil systems and expect an acceleration  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:24):**  in this already extraordinary decline in fertility.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:27):**  And so the extinction event will happen through  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:30):**  an acceleration of chronic disease  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:32):**  coupled with this total loss of fertility  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:34):**  within the species.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:36):**  And that's not specific to humans obviously.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:38):**  We've seen 50% of life wiped off the face of the planet  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:42):**  in the last 40 or 50 years.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:45):**  And so there's been many books written on this  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:47):**  and everything else.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:48):**  We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:50):**  on planet right now.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:51):**  And this time, this is from the cataclysmic event  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:54):**  that we call a human.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:55):**  Other cataclysmic events that have caused widespread death  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:58):**  of species across the world have always tied back  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:01):**  to soil and water destruction.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:04):**  Typically it's an asteroid that covers the earth  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:06):**  with a layer of dust, disrupts the respiratory system  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:09):**  of the planet.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:10):**  You end up with CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere,  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:12):**  you acidify the oceans, and then you get widespread  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:15):**  87 to 97% wipeout of life on earth.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:18):**  That's happened five previous times.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:20):**  And so the sixth time, we're now the great destructive force  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:24):**  that's destroying our soil systems,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:25):**  causing the accumulation of CO2, methane,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:28):**  and other carbon substrates into the atmosphere,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:30):**  which are then acidifying the oceans  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:32):**  through the same process.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:33):**  And so we've seen this cycle many times.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:36):**  And so mapping out an extinction event  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:38):**  doesn't have to be theoretical.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:39):**  We have a lot of data in the fossil record  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:42):**  and a lot of data around what's currently happening  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:44):**  over the last 40 years to understand how we're undermining  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:47):**  and how this rolls out over the next few decades.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:52):**  Zach, what resources can you recommend for people  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:54):**  who want to learn more?

**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:58):**  that you've been describing in the fossil record  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:01):**  and so forth, but specifically to this human causation,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:04):**  the impact of pesticides, autism, cancer,

**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:16):**  I hope not, because that's the book I'm writing right now.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:18):**  But honestly, there's a ton of great books out there  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:24):**  that touch on this from different perspectives.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:27):**  I think the work that was done with the two books,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:30):**  one is called Sapiens,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:32):**  and then the follow-up was called Homo Deus.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:34):**  Those two books, I think,

**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:49):**  but a good understanding of where we stand  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:52):**  in the history of mankind and the planet as a whole.

**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:01):**  I think Stephanie Sanneff has done some of the best work  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:04):**  in the country in publishing a lot of peer-reviewed papers  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:08):**  on the topic.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:09):**  She's a computer scientist out of MIT.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:12):**  She actually was the director of AI at MIT  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:15):**  in the 1980s and 90s, incredibly brilliant woman.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:19):**  And by 1998, she was starting to pick up  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:21):**  mathematical patterns in the epidemics of chronic disease  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:24):**  that were pointing to some drastic change  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:26):**  in the environment.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:28):**  And she was the first one to really identify glyphosate  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:32):**  as that smoking gun to accelerate all of this  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:35):**  that we've been talking about.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:36):**  So Sanneff is S-E-N-N-E-F there, and Stephanie's got  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:40):**  a great spectrum of papers out there  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:42):**  if you wanna dive deeper into that.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:45):**  One of the criticisms that I've heard about Stephanie's work  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:49):**  and about this general conversation  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:51):**  of implicating glyphosate in particular  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:55):**  and agricultural chemicals in general  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:57):**  is the whole conversation about correlation  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:00):**  versus causation.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:01):**  What is your response to correlation versus causation?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:04):**  Super important.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:05):**  Yeah, no, that's exactly super important.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:07):**  So that's what our lab has brought in over the last  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:10):**  seven years is really the causation piece.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:13):**  She's been doing phenomenal work,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:14):**  understanding the theoretical models  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:17):**  as to how glyphosate is disrupting protein structures  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:20):**  and all of that.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:21):**  But our lab is the first to really identify  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:23):**  how that's being done and where in the body  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:25):**  is that protein disruption happening  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:27):**  specifically around the gut lining and the like.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:30):**  We've also shown gut brain injury  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:32):**  with the blood brain barrier directly damaged  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:34):**  by these systems as well.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:35):**  So we've got a bunch of white papers  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:38):**  and peer reviewed science that can be found  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:40):**  on ionbiome.com, I-O-N-B-I-O-M-E, ionbiome.com.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:46):**  Thanks for sharing those references.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:48):**  Can you give us a verbal overview  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:50):**  in addition to those papers,

**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:54):**  and what you've been learning and discovering?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:57):**  Yeah, so our first work was done looking at  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:01):**  the direct influence of glyphosate on those boundaries  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:04):**  of the tight junctions as they're referred to.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:07):**  Tight junctions are those Velcro-like proteins,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:10):**  complex structures, there's about 13 different proteins  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:13):**  that are involved in a tight junction  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:14):**  anchoring one cell to the next.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:17):**  And they act as intelligent gatekeepers.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:19):**  So they actually allow macromolecules  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:22):**  and things like soluble fiber  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:23):**  and other large carbohydrates  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:25):**  to cross between the epithelial boundary  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:28):**  so that they don't have to be transported through the cell.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:31):**  So it's an intelligent gatekeeper system  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:33):**  and we were the first lab to show  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:35):**  the direct effects of glyphosate disrupting that Velcro.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:38):**  And we've also shown in those  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:40):**  that there's a phenotypic change  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:42):**  or a change in the characteristics of those cells  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:45):**  once they fall apart.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:46):**  They've quickly moved to a kind of precancerous state.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:50):**  They appear much smaller than they were  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:53):**  in the healthy state just moments before they broke apart.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:56):**  They have a characteristic shrinkage of the cytoplasm  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:59):**  or fluid within the cell.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:01):**  And that's one of the hallmarks  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:02):**  of kind of a precancerous cells.

**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:24):**  and glyphosate demonstrating that  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:26):**  we really didn't have gluten sensitivity  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:28):**  in any significant amount in the population until 1992  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:33):**  when we started spraying wheat directly with glyphosate.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:36):**  And we've shown the mechanism by which glyphosate  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:38):**  and gluten synergistically disrupt that tight junction.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:42):**  And so that paper's out there  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:44):**  one of our first publications there  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:46):**  and that synergy between gluten and glyphosate  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:48):**  to induce gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:50):**  Many people who've experienced gluten sensitivity  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:52):**  or friends that do almost everybody's now one degree  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:56):**  of separation from somebody who's got gluten sensitivity  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:59):**  will find that if they go to Europe  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:01):**  or another environment where there's no use  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:03):**  of glyphosate in the wheat systems,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:06):**  you don't see the same symptoms that are associated  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:09):**  with what we call gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:11):**  The conclusion of that is really that  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:13):**  we don't really have gluten sensitivity,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:14):**  we have glyphosate toxicity.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:16):**  And when you have glyphosate toxicity,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:18):**  then things like gluten and even in our clinic,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:21):**  we found even things like kale can become pro-inflammatory  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:24):**  and cause bloating and pain and inflammation signals  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:28):**  and symptoms in human patients  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:31):**  that have that leaky gut injury.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:33):**  And so that has been an interesting look  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:35):**  at how healthy grains and foods  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:38):**  that have been in the diet for thousands of years  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:40):**  can suddenly become noxious to us.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:42):**  And in the same way, you can see the effects of children  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:45):**  who are now allergic to so many foods and systems.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:48):**  So it used to be when I was growing up,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:50):**  there was one kid in our entire school of 800 kids  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:53):**  that had a peanut allergy.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:54):**  And so there was one EpiPen and the nurse's thing  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:57):**  with his name on it.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:59):**  Now, if you go into a nurse's office,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:01):**  you've got many dozens of EpiPens with different allergies  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:05):**  from everything from pollen to dust mites,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:07):**  to cat dander and everything else,  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:09):**  all the way down to the foods of avocados and eggs  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:13):**  and seeds and all kinds of things  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:15):**  that they're deathly allergic to now.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:17):**  And so as we see that erosion of that,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:20):**  we see the rise of that immune dysfunction there.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:23):**  So that's all tied up in that causation effect  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:25):**  that you're inquiring about.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:27):**  I'm very excited to see Stephanie's work of 30 years  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:30):**  start to really be supported by these causation studies  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:33):**  to show that she was indeed right in her modeling.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:37):**  It is remarkable when you start to think about the idea,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:41):**  the phrase of food allergy put together as a common phrase.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:46):**  It should give us pause to stop and ask the question,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:48):**  why would people be allergic to food?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:50):**  Why should people be allergic to food?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:52):**  They should not, of course.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:54):**  Exactly, and I'm always dumbfounded by my own career.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:58):**  Like, we are not taught to ask those questions  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:01):**  as physicians, it's so bizarre.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:03):**  Like, in deeper than the question of,  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:05):**  why are kids allergic to food?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:07):**  The next or more extreme version of that is,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:10):**  why are children unable to breathe?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:12):**  And we've got one in eight children with asthma  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:15):**  in the United States, Australia, UK,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:18):**  and so one in eight children can't breathe.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:21):**  You've got one in four children that can't eat or breathe  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:25):**  without having an allergic reaction.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:27):**  It's just a totally astounding demonstration  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:30):**  of the extreme disruption that we've done to human biology,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:34):**  such that we can't even live on planet earth anymore  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:37):**  without immune dysfunction and rapid aging.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:40):**  And so we are really seeing the destruction of a planet.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:42):**  I think back to those science fiction Star Trek episodes  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:47):**  that I would catch at a friend's house  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:49):**  when I was a kid or something,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:50):**  and it was like mind blowing to see these,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:53):**  think about these other planets  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:54):**  and exploring the solar systems  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:56):**  and seeing plants that could or could not support life,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:58):**  and some had oxygen, some didn't,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:00):**  some had water, some didn't.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:01):**  You know, this concept,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:02):**  well, we're about to create a planet  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:04):**  that doesn't have water or soil systems  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:06):**  that support biologic life and human existence.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:09):**  And so we really are creating a Martian landscape  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:14):**  that's inhospitable to our own species  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:17):**  as we continue to destroy the ecosystem around us.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:21):**  Our biggest agricultural export is topsoil  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:24):**  sent to the tune of 75 billion tons per year.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:27):**  And that is, it gives us,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:28):**  I think recall the math correctly,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:30):**  that gives us in the remaining 60 cropping years  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:33):**  until the topsoil will be completely gone.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:35):**  Yep, you're exactly right on that.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:37):**  That 60 years was an astounding number  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:40):**  because I just heard that only like three or four years ago  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:43):**  from Alan Williams was blown away by that statistic  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:46):**  because it maps so darn close

**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:08):**  That is ground zero, no pun intended, or maybe pun intended.

**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:56):**  of our gross domestic product every year  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:58):**  being flushed down rivers and into oceans

**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:13):**  is that's real to politicians,  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:14):**  that's real to economists and economy forecasters,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:19):**  it's real to the fundamental consumer product industry  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:22):**  that's relying on production of those soils  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:25):**  to fuel their plastics industry or their fuel industry.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:30):**  Our commodities crops are by and large  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:32):**  not going into food anymore.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:33):**  They're going towards these oil-based products  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:37):**  like apparel and hospital equipment  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:40):**  and packaging for consumer goods and all of this.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:44):**  If we start to show this direct fiscal financial loss,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:49):**  I think that it's a different avenue  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:51):**  into the minds of the powers that be  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:53):**  around money management in this country.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:55):**  And I think we're seeing an adjustment.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:57):**  I think we're seeing an enormous explosion of interest  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:00):**  in impact investment funds and regenerative agriculture  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:03):**  and regen supply systems and everything else.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:06):**  And certainly this whole pandemic  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:08):**  that we've just been through  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:09):**  has put a very fine point on it.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:11):**  We've lost hundreds of millions of jobs worldwide.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:14):**  We've pushed an estimated 125 million households  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:18):**  into financial crisis  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:19):**  with another 125 million households joining them  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:23):**  within the next four weeks if we don't get things going,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:25):**  which it looks like we won't.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:27):**  And so 250 million households  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:29):**  being pressed into crisis financially  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:32):**  and having a sense also of the fragile supply chain  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:36):**  of the current mega industry approach to food systems.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:40):**  And so I'm very excited to see these kind of fiscal numbers  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:44):**  rather than just the biologic concept we put on this.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:47):**  I think it's more palatable and feels more real  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:50):**  to a lot of the decision makers in our economy.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:53):**  We've been focusing our conversation so far  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:56):**  on the challenges of glyphosate,  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:57):**  but one of the pieces that really got me  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:59):**  and started down this pathway over a decade ago  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:02):**  was the realization that the majority of ag pesticides  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:06):**  that are used and sprayed on our landscape  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:08):**  are significant endocrine disruptors.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:10):**  In fact, many of the insecticides and so forth  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:13):**  function as endocrine disruptors  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:16):**  and the implications of what that means  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:18):**  for our own endocrine system  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:20):**  and the very infinitesimally small quantities  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:24):**  that are required to be significant disruptors.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:27):**  Could you offer your perspective  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:29):**  and share your perspective on what it means  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:31):**  for our bodies to be disrupted by endocrine disruptors  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:34):**  and what is really required  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:36):**  and the impact that ag pesticides can have in that context?  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:40):**  Yeah, it's an interesting reality  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:43):**  because once you open up that gut lining with glyphosate,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:47):**  you now are opening the path for innumerable chemicals  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:50):**  and toxins to come in after it.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:52):**  And some of the most ubiquitous of those  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:55):**  is actually the plastics and long chain petroleum products  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:59):**  that we see in chemical agriculture  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:02):**  and like our fertilizer systems.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:04):**  And so as we develop these small  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:06):**  and long chain molecule resources for agricultural system,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:11):**  as well as our consumer packaged goods  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:13):**  and all the other ways we use plastics,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:15):**  and then you add Roundup to the system,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:17):**  you've opened up the gate, if you will,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:20):**  and all of those go pouring into the human system.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:23):**  The endocrine system is a really elaborate system  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:26):**  of feedback loops and communication networks  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:29):**  within the body that coordinate the behavior  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:32):**  of some 70 trillion human cells,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:34):**  and then figure out their relationship  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:37):**  and response to around 1.4 quadrillion bacteria,

**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:27):**  As the kidney damage happens through glyphosate  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:29):**  plus the endocrine disruption effects,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:32):**  you start to dump protein into the urine

**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:38):**  that the body has, which are the amino acids

**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:52):**  drop in sperm counts, drop in fertility in women  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:55):**  with the dysregulation of insulin

**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:08):**  The amount of this disruption has gotten so severe

**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:13):**  like hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroiditis  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:16):**  that's common in women more than men.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:19):**  But we see it now in universal screening,  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:21):**  even as early as 2005, we were seeing one in four women,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:26):**  one in four girls at age 12

**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:31):**  And so that's kind of the level of endocrine dysfunction  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:34):**  where our own endocrine system is being destroyed

**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:41):**  and that self identity is eroded by glyphosate

**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:04):**  we were sat in innumerable living rooms of farmers

**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:33):**  it's not unusual to find farmers that have been diagnosed

**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:43):**  And when you walk into their kitchens,  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:46):**  you realize that they are starving of nutrients.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:50):**  They are literally eating frozen pizzas

**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:57):**  and shipped and sold at ridiculously low prices of $1.99  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:01):**  for a Totino's pizza or something like that.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:03):**  And that's dinner for a farm that owns 3000 acres  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:08):**  and then spends their entire livelihood  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:10):**  growing thousands of acres of supposed food crop.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:12):**  And they are starving with a lack of nutrients in the home.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:16):**  And so you can see this just food desert effect.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:19):**  Kansas is our most agricultural state in the union.

**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:26):**  I've heard from the farmers so far,  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:28):**  but at Fuller Farms,  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:30):**  I think it was maybe two years ago now,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:32):**  or maybe just last year,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:33):**  the Fuller Farms event, a great presentation,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:36):**  it was demonstrated that Kansas,  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:38):**  where we were having the event  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:39):**  is covered in 90% agricultural system by land volume.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:44):**  And the state has to import 90% of its food.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:49):**  And one in four children is going hungry each night  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:52):**  in Kansas for a lack of nutrients and calories.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:54):**  So a really devastating look at just how  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:57):**  we aren't feeding the world

**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:04):**  And as we mentioned earlier,  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:05):**  much of those commodity crops are now going into  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:08):**  either feed for cattle and poultry and swine,

**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:15):**  or they're going into the small molecule production

**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:54):**  The agribusiness marketing mantra  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:56):**  of needing to feed the world has certainly become  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:00):**  very popular in the farming community.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:02):**  And I've made the comment as well,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:04):**  it's not a popular comment to make at a farm meeting  
**[0:46:07-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:07):**  in the Midwest, but the Midwest really is  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:09):**  a good food desert.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:10):**  It's hard to find.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:12):**  If you're traveling and you want to stay at a hotel,  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:15):**  the typical hotel in the Midwest,  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:17):**  the quality of food that is served  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:19):**  at a continental breakfast that is considered to be food  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:21):**  is not fit for human consumption, quite frankly.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:25):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:26):**  Yeah, and it was so interesting too.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:28):**  Like when we were up in Minnesota,  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:31):**  we were like our third night into this two week road trip,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:34):**  we were all starting to feel sick.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:36):**  Like we were all just feeling wiped out  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:38):**  and starting to feel depressed.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:40):**  And frankly, we were starting to fall asleep  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:43):**  in the middle of conversations and stuff like that,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:45):**  just with incredible fatigue in our whole group.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:48):**  And we went to the front desk,  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:51):**  trying to find some dinner asking,  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:53):**  is there any health food places around?  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:55):**  And these two young women at the desk looked at each other  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:59):**  like we had asked if there were elephants around  
**[0:47:01-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:01):**  or something like that.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:01):**  They didn't even know what those two words meant  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:03):**  next to each other, health food.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:05):**  And they said, well, there's three restaurants.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:07):**  And so they told us about the three restaurants  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:09):**  we could drive to.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:10):**  And we went to the one that was right on the river.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:14):**  They said, it's got good fish or something, they said.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:17):**  So we went there, most of our team not even eating fish,  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:20):**  we're plant-based people.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:22):**  And we show up there and it is the grossest looking  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:26):**  salad bar you've ever seen in your life.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:28):**  Everything's fried, everything's been obliterated  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:31):**  from any nutrient connection back to mother nature.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:34):**  And so you're absolutely right that  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:36):**  not only is there a food desert,  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:37):**  I think there's a memory deficit of what life would look like  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:41):**  if there was real food around.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:43):**  What did these farms look like in the 1950s?  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:45):**  Well, they all had backyard gardens that were booming  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:48):**  and they were feeding themselves out of their own gardens.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:51):**  And then they would sell the crops  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:52):**  from the rest of the acreage,  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:53):**  but they were always feeding themselves.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:55):**  And so somewhere between 1945 and 1975,  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:59):**  we forced these farmers to grow their operations  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:02):**  and shrink their workforce to eke out ever more profit  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:06):**  for the middlemen and distributors and everything else,  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:09):**  such that these farmers didn't have time or energy left  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:13):**  to grow their own food in their backyards.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:15):**  It was only a couple of the farms  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:17):**  that were starting to make the transition back to regen  
**[0:48:20-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:20):**  that we found growing their own food  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:21):**  in any significant portion.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:23):**  And that's, I think, really telling.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:26):**  And I don't blame these farmers for that at all,  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:29):**  because the reality is, as a farmer,  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:31):**  as anybody's listening to this show, it probably is,  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:34):**  you guys are faced with a situation that  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:37):**  if you take inflation into consideration,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:40):**  the amount of profit or cents on the dollar  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:44):**  that's coming back,  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:45):**  so for every consumer dollar spent on food,  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:48):**  I think you're now down to about 14 cents  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:50):**  returning to the farmer.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:52):**  For the farmer in the 1960s,  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:54):**  that number was around 60 cents on the dollar.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:57):**  So 60 cents on the dollar  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:58):**  going directly back to the farmer in 1960s,  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:00):**  now it's 14 cents for the farmer today.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:02):**  And then if you take in inflation,  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:04):**  that's actually a 96% reduction in your livelihood  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:08):**  or the amount of money coming from consumer back to farmer  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:12):**  over that period of time.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:14):**  That's why farms have had to grow so large ultimately,  
**[0:49:17-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:17):**  is not just because these farmers wanna get rich,  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:19):**  they have to grow 10 times more crop  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:22):**  if they're going to make it at 14 cents on the dollar.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:25):**  And so it's really the economics of all of the subsidization  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:30):**  and false economies of banks loaning out money for inputs,  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:34):**  and then the banks getting back an interest on all of that.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:38):**  And then you've got distributors that have become  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:40):**  these almost monopoly-like juggernauts  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:44):**  between you and the customer.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:45):**  All of this is built in an insoluble system  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:48):**  that has forced farmers into a state of exhaustion  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:50):**  that has just really rarely been seen in history, if ever.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:55):**  To add to your earlier comments,  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:57):**  it's easy for us to forget that the agricultural landscape  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:01):**  actually looked significantly different  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:03):**  not that long ago in history.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:05):**  Today, we have the significant majority of apple production  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:08):**  all concentrated in the state of Washington, for example,  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:10):**  and there's other regions of the country,  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:11):**  New York and Michigan contribute some as well  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:13):**  in other parts of the country.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:15):**  But not so very long ago, if I recall correctly, was 1949.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:20):**  Prior to 1949, the state of Iowa was the sixth  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:23):**  in the nation in apple production.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:25):**  And there was large-scale flax production,  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:27):**  a lot of what could be considered more specialty crops.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:30):**  And today in the state of Iowa,  
**[0:50:32-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:32):**  anything that's not corn and not soybeans  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:34):**  is considered a specialty crop.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:35):**  So the agricultural landscape has shifted,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:38):**  as you pointed out, for a whole variety,  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:40):**  a whole range of different reasons and influences.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:43):**  But I want to come back,  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:44):**  we've talked about the challenges of glyphosate  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:47):**  and pesticides and the health epidemic  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:52):**  or the sickness epidemic that is occurring  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:54):**  in the countryside and across the country.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:56):**  The obvious question that needs to be asked is,  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:59):**  how can people in rural areas protect themselves?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:03):**  Yeah, I think it really begins in your soil  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:06):**  and it's such a fast recovery, I find it phenomenal.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:09):**  For all the bad news that we've shared on this podcast,  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:12):**  I think the silver lining here, in fact,  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:15):**  the bright light at the end of this tunnel of destruction  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:18):**  that we've experienced as an agricultural system  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:21):**  is this regenerative movement.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:23):**  I'm just dumbfounded by the speed  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:25):**  at which the recovery happens, not just for the soil,  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:28):**  but the health and vitality of families.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:31):**  And so, Don and Grant and Brightcrutes  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:34):**  that were featured in our first  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:37):**  farmer's footprint documentary, they are a great example  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:39):**  of just the vitality that they've been bringing back  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:42):**  into their environment.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:44):**  Since making the transition to a regenerative system,  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:47):**  they've certainly grown their farm,  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:48):**  they've got a lot more acreage under farming now,  
**[0:51:51-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:51):**  they were kind of at a financial crisis point.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:54):**  Before making the transition,  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:55):**  farm was overrun with Roundup resistant weeds  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:58):**  that were shutting down equipment  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:00):**  and all kinds of things falling apart.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:02):**  And as they've made this steady increase  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:04):**  to a regenerative system,  
**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:06):**  they've just seen an explosion in their progress.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:09):**  And not only has that been good for business on the farm,  
**[0:52:13-0:52:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:13):**  it's inspired their daughter to return to the farm  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:15):**  with her family and create a direct to consumer marketplace  
**[0:52:18-0:52:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:18):**  for their grass raised beef that's participating  
**[0:52:21-0:52:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:21):**  in the regeneration of the soils of their land they run  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:25):**  and all of this.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:26):**  And so seeing a multi-generational farm  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:29):**  start to reclaim its potential there is really thrilling.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:33):**  And that farm had been in the family,  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:35):**  I believe for their, in the fourth generation,  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:37):**  I believe there with grants, current management.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:40):**  And so to see this fourth or fifth generation  
**[0:52:43-0:52:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:43):**  coming on with their children is just phenomenally exciting  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:46):**  that that potential is there.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:48):**  And if you go out to any commodities growing farm right now,  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:51):**  one of their primary concerns is the session plans.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:54):**  There are not enough children wanting to stay  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:57):**  in those environments to fight out  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:58):**  an ever smaller margin of success  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:03):**  with ever more effort and more toxic lifestyle  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:06):**  and more lonely lifestyle that's happening  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:09):**  in these mega farm environments.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:11):**  And so regenerative agriculture is so interesting  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:14):**  in that it solves so many levels of the crisis that we're in.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:18):**  One of the neat ones is reconnection to community.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:20):**  Going to a regen conference is like going  
**[0:53:22-0:53:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:22):**  to a massive family reunion where there's just so much joy  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:25):**  and everybody is talking about, I mean,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:27):**  what they've seen fixed on their land  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:30):**  as mother nature's taken back over,  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:31):**  what species they're now seeing and cover crops coming up,  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:35):**  what species of ancient prairie grass is starting to grow  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:39):**  on their land again and what types of species  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:41):**  of birds are back in.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:43):**  Like that's what I hear in the halls of regen agricultural.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:46):**  If you go to your conventional agricultural system,  
**[0:53:50-0:53:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:50):**  everybody's talking about their bushels of soybeans  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:52):**  and how many per acre and what are their best inputs  
**[0:53:56-0:54:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:56):**  and what's the new farm subsidy that's best to go after,  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:00):**  how much sugar beet should you plant  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:02):**  so you get the maximum subsidies.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:05):**  It's just an opposite conversation that really speaks  
**[0:54:09-0:54:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:09):**  to not just the health of the human beings  
**[0:54:11-0:54:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:11):**  in that environment, the health and vitality of economics,  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:14):**  ecology, all of it is just beautiful ripples  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:18):**  of generative, regenerative life giving  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:22):**  on every level kind of effects.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:25):**  Zach, I want to get into the conversation more deeply  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:27):**  about agriculture and agronomy,  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:29):**  but I want to go back to the question that I asked you  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:32):**  in the context of personal human health.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:34):**  How can people in rural areas protect themselves?  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:37):**  How can our listeners, where can they go to learn more  
**[0:54:40-0:54:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:40):**  on how to protect their own health  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:42):**  and how to regenerate their own bodies, microbiome,  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:45):**  if you will, to overcome the challenges  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:49):**  that are being inflicted upon them by their environment?  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:52):**  Yeah, those are great questions.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:53):**  And the answers are challenging in the backyard,  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:57):**  but they are there.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:58):**  So starting to grow your own food

**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:02):**  is the idea that we have the capacity  
**[0:59:04-0:59:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:04):**  to grow food as medicine.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:06):**  So I'd like to ask you from your perspective as a doctor,  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:09):**  what does food need to be to be medicinal?

**[0:59:14-0:59:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:14):**  So there's a macronutrient answer to that.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:17):**  And that's fiber.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:19):**  So fiber is a critical, critical piece for medicine.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:23):**  The fiber acts as the coral reef, if you will,  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:25):**  to the ecology of the human gut.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:27):**  And so fiber rich foods are critical  
**[0:59:30-0:59:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:30):**  to building that healthy ecosystem within the gut  
**[0:59:33-0:59:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:33):**  and with the extended organ system within the body  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:35):**  to support bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and the like  
**[0:59:39-0:59:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:39):**  in that complex ecosystem that can generate fuel  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:42):**  at every source.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:43):**  They can detox the system as needed, all of that life.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:47):**  So fiber, I think, is a very overlooked macronutrient  
**[0:59:51-0:59:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:51):**  that's critical to human health  
**[0:59:53-0:59:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:53):**  as a medicinal kind of quality to it.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:56):**  Then after that, you get into small molecules.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:58):**  The alkaloids get most of the attention here,  
**[1:00:01-1:00:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:01):**  but there's certainly many other flavonoids  
**[1:00:03-1:00:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:03):**  and other small molecules made within the plant systems  
**[1:00:08-1:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:08):**  that have profound impact on human physiology,  
**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:11):**  human biology, detoxification, all of that.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:14):**  And so the alkaloids, it turns out, are made through  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:17):**  the shikimate pathway largely as well.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:19):**  And so you end up disrupting that with glyphosate.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:22):**  And so by going to regenerative organic process,  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:25):**  you start to give back the alkaloids  
**[1:00:27-1:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:27):**  back into the food system by increasing the amount  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:30):**  of rich root vegetable intake.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:32):**  You're talking about things like, again, your daikon radish,  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:35):**  your red radish, black radish, turnips, beets,  
**[1:00:39-1:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:39):**  potatoes, carrots, and the like.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:41):**  All of those are gonna have a rich assay, if you will,  
**[1:00:44-1:00:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:44):**  of micronutrients coming out of that shikimate pathway  
**[1:00:47-1:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:47):**  with the alkaloid medicinals.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:49):**  And then when you go above soil,  
**[1:00:50-1:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:50):**  you get into the whole nother class of alkaloids  
**[1:00:52-1:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:52):**  that are present in our cruciferous vegetables,  
**[1:00:54-1:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:54):**  like Brussels sprouts, kale, and the like.  
**[1:00:57-1:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:57):**  Finally, as you go into the fruits,  
**[1:00:59-1:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:59):**  you see some profound compounds in there.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:01):**  Lycopene is a good example of one in tomatoes, for example.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:04):**  It has huge anti-cancer effects.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:06):**  The lycopene content of a tomato that's grown  
**[1:01:10-1:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:10):**  in a hydroponic system and looks all red and pretty  
**[1:01:13-1:01:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:13):**  and an insect has never touched it,  
**[1:01:15-1:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:15):**  actually has almost undetectable levels  
**[1:01:17-1:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:17):**  of that lycopene cancer killer.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:20):**  And so we really need to not just grow food  
**[1:01:23-1:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:23):**  that looks pretty, we need to grow food that is nutrient  
**[1:01:26-1:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:26):**  and medicine dense again, if we're gonna expect to see  
**[1:01:29-1:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:29):**  a reversal of this extinction event unfold.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:32):**  You didn't mention the biology that is associated  
**[1:01:35-1:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:35):**  with these various plants.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:37):**  Are those important for food to be medicinal as well  
**[1:01:40-1:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:40):**  to our own microbiome?  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:42):**  The biology in which the plants are grown?  
**[1:01:44-1:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:44):**  The biology that is contained within  
**[1:01:47-1:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:47):**  and on the surfaces of those plants.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:49):**  Ah, yes, yeah, that's a really cool concept.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:52):**  Yeah, so the microbiome, the bacteria,  
**[1:01:54-1:01:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:54):**  the fungi associated with the plants themselves  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:57):**  seem to have an important relationship  
**[1:01:59-1:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:59):**  to your gut experience.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:00):**  And so I'm fascinated by the tomato  
**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:03):**  as a good example of this.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:04):**  Again, the tomato has these tiny hair-like particles  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:07):**  that are over the surface.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:09):**  Many of you have picked a tomato before  
**[1:02:11-1:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:11):**  and remember what that feels like,  
**[1:02:13-1:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:13):**  that slight amount of just fuzziness that the tomato has.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:17):**  But as soon as you pick it,  
**[1:02:18-1:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:18):**  and by the time you carry it into the house,  
**[1:02:20-1:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:20):**  it's now kind of starting to feel like that smooth potato  
**[1:02:22-1:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:22):**  and the moment you rinse it, all of that is gone.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:25):**  Well, with that incredibly diverse hair-like follicles  
**[1:02:29-1:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:29):**  that cover the entire fruit,  
**[1:02:31-1:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:31):**  you've got this diverse micro ecosystem of bacteria,  
**[1:02:34-1:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:34):**  fungi, and the like.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:35):**  And if we look for a moment out into nature  
**[1:02:37-1:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:37):**  to learn something about that,  
**[1:02:39-1:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:39):**  we find out that all of the animals that graze  
**[1:02:43-1:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:43):**  are always going to be eating fruits and berries  
**[1:02:46-1:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:46):**  and the like off the plant and vegetables and the like.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:49):**  Well, they're not gonna go eat the ones  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:51):**  that have fallen off the plant already.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:52):**  Typically, you're only gonna see animals grazing on food  
**[1:02:56-1:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:56):**  that's out there in the living state,  
**[1:02:58-1:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:58):**  in the unpicked state.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:00):**  And I've taught a lot of my patients  
**[1:03:02-1:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:02):**  how to go back to that process.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:03):**  So remember to at least take a bite of food every day  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:06):**  that hasn't been picked,  
**[1:03:08-1:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:08):**  that is on the living plant,  
**[1:03:09-1:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:09):**  has the microbiome intact  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:11):**  to increase your gut microbiome intelligence  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:13):**  as you engage with it.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:15):**  And so I'm always intrigued by the experience  
**[1:03:18-1:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:18):**  of biting into that tomato on the vine.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:20):**  I invite you all to try this  
**[1:03:22-1:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:22):**  because it's a different experience than picking that  
**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:24):**  and eating it a moment later.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:26):**  To feel that hair-like quality to the tomato,  
**[1:03:29-1:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:29):**  that tiny little microscopic fuzz touch the tongue,  
**[1:03:33-1:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:33):**  you will get a tingle out of that.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:34):**  You'll get an experience out of just that  
**[1:03:36-1:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:36):**  because that is a piece of the tomato  
**[1:03:38-1:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:38):**  that you've been missing in your diet  
**[1:03:40-1:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:40):**  since the beginning of agriculture really.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:42):**  So thinking about how do I get as close to the plant  
**[1:03:45-1:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:45):**  as possible is a very interesting new concept for nutrition.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:49):**  Zach, there are many questions that I'd love to ask you.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:51):**  We're only partially through the list  
**[1:03:52-1:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:52):**  that I put together,  
**[1:03:53-1:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:53):**  and I know we're running out of time.  
**[1:03:56-1:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:56):**  But there is one more question  
**[1:03:57-1:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:57):**  that I think is very important for us to talk about  
**[1:04:00-1:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:00):**  and I'd love to get your perspective on.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:02):**  You described how glyphosate  
**[1:04:04-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:04):**  and many of the associated compounds  
**[1:04:09-1:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:09):**  challenge the gut microbiome and challenge the gut lining  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:12):**  and how that is connected to suicide tendencies,  
**[1:04:16-1:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:16):**  suicidal tendencies and depression and so forth.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:18):**  And to me, this is a fascinating conversation  
**[1:04:21-1:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:21):**  because of the studying that I have already done  
**[1:04:23-1:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:23):**  about the various neurotransmitters  
**[1:04:25-1:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:25):**  and neural networks in our bodies.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:27):**  When you consider the neural network of the gut  
**[1:04:30-1:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:30):**  and the heart and the brain  
**[1:04:32-1:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:32):**  and how those are all connected by these neurotransmitters,  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:35):**  one of the pieces that this ties together  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:38):**  is an observation where we've observed  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:41):**  that many very good growers who are very in tune  
**[1:04:46-1:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:46):**  with what is happening on their operation  
**[1:04:48-1:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:48):**  actively seek to develop their intuition.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:52):**  And they are very good at walking into a field  
**[1:04:56-1:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:56):**  and saying something is going on.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:59):**  I'm not sure what's going on,  
**[1:05:00-1:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:00):**  but something is off with this block  
**[1:05:03-1:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:03):**  or something is off with this animal.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:05):**  They can't describe it intellectually.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:07):**  There may not be anything observable  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:10):**  that they can point to visually,  
**[1:05:12-1:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:12):**  but they have this intuitive gut instinct  
**[1:05:15-1:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:15):**  of something not being well.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:18):**  So the question that I have for you  
**[1:05:20-1:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:20):**  is when we consider all of these different connections,  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:23):**  what does it mean to be fully connected,  
**[1:05:27-1:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:27):**  fully human and fully spiritually present as a farmer?  
**[1:05:31-1:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:31):**  It's the most beautiful place that we could end.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:33):**  I just love the question.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:35):**  I love the deep insights and experience  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:38):**  that would lead to a question like that.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:40):**  A beautiful thing that I think,  
**[1:05:43-1:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:43):**  as you were speaking there,  
**[1:05:44-1:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:44):**  hearkened to one of my big heroes in the field,  
**[1:05:47-1:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:47):**  which is Charles Massey in Australia there.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:50):**  And I think his recent book,  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:52):**  The Call of the Reed Warbler,  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:54):**  is a book of poetry as much as it is a document  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:57):**  of regenerative force and capacity of a farm.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:01):**  And I think he captures in that first couple  
**[1:06:04-1:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:04):**  of paragraphs, pages of the book,  
**[1:06:07-1:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:07):**  that transition for him where he went  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:09):**  from an exhausted, commodities crop kind of producer  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:13):**  and had lost all sense of spiritual connection to his land  
**[1:06:18-1:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:18):**  to this incredible reawakening of that connection  
**[1:06:21-1:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:21):**  and a reawakening of the sense of beauty and love  
**[1:06:24-1:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:24):**  for his land.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:25):**  And I feel like that is just a real testimony, I think,  
**[1:06:29-1:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:29):**  to what we're being called here to this planet  
**[1:06:32-1:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:32):**  to do as human beings,  
**[1:06:33-1:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:33):**  which is to be in a co-creative process  
**[1:06:36-1:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:36):**  with Mother Nature herself.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:38):**  It's almost terrifying that we forgot  
**[1:06:41-1:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:41):**  we were here to create.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:43):**  We have come here as such a consumptive  
**[1:06:45-1:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:45):**  and destructive Western civilization that we forgot,  
**[1:06:49-1:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:49):**  that we are really called to receive from Mother Earth  
**[1:06:54-1:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:54):**  rather than to take from her.  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:55):**  And she wants to give bountifully to all of her children,  
**[1:07:00-1:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:00):**  this sense of just a real joy for watching new species  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:04):**  or ancient species of birds returning to your land  
**[1:07:08-1:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:08):**  when you start to allow crop diversification  
**[1:07:10-1:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:10):**  and cover crops to come back in and wild flowers to grow  
**[1:07:13-1:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:13):**  on the edges of your farm again and the likes.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:15):**  It's just a real reminder to us  
**[1:07:18-1:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:18):**  that we're here to be recipients and co-creators  
**[1:07:22-1:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:22):**  for a healthier and more beautiful future.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:25):**  I think it's interesting that humans showed up.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:28):**  We showed up 200,000 years ago,  
**[1:07:29-1:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:29):**  if the fossil record's accurate.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:31):**  And so 200,000 years in a planet  
**[1:07:34-1:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:34):**  that's four and a half billion years old.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:36):**  And so imagine the beauty that existed so far  
**[1:07:39-1:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:39):**  before our experience here.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:41):**  Imagine the beauty that preceded the last great extinction  
**[1:07:43-1:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:43):**  of the dinosaurs and all of that.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:46):**  There were ferns that were the size of houses.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:48):**  There was just vibrant nutrient-dense forests  
**[1:07:52-1:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:52):**  and everything else that allowed life to thrive  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:55):**  as it did at that time.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:56):**  We've never seen the return of reptiles at that scale  
**[1:08:00-1:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:00):**  because we don't have nutrient density  
**[1:08:01-1:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:01):**  to allow for that scale of life to return yet.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:05):**  And so in our human experience,  
**[1:08:07-1:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:07):**  we don't even know how beautiful this planet could get.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:10):**  But I think you get it in moments of sense  
**[1:08:12-1:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:12):**  of the sun rising and the mist rising  
**[1:08:14-1:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:14):**  from Charles' farm there.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:17):**  And you've got the birds singing  
**[1:08:19-1:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:19):**  and the pond system starting to do the hydraulic cycle again  
**[1:08:24-1:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:24):**  and you've got just this multi-tiered beauty  
**[1:08:27-1:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:27):**  to the whole system.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:28):**  I see that very thing in those farm events  
**[1:08:31-1:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:31):**  that are regenerative in their purpose,  
**[1:08:33-1:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:33):**  where you see people in tears often hugging  
**[1:08:36-1:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:36):**  and so glad to see each other  
**[1:08:38-1:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:38):**  and telling beautiful stories of what's happening  
**[1:08:41-1:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:41):**  because they're feeling not just an improvement  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:43):**  in economic security,  
**[1:08:45-1:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:45):**  they're feeling an improvement in self-identity.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:47):**  They have a deep-rooted sense of this is who I am  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:50):**  as a farmer, I am here to co-create and be witness  
**[1:08:54-1:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:54):**  to Mother Nature doing her very best  
**[1:08:56-1:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:56):**  rather than constantly fighting Mother Nature  
**[1:08:59-1:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:59):**  in all that she does.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:00):**  And so it's just a real deep question that you ask there  
**[1:09:04-1:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:04):**  and I'm sure that you are closer to the experience of that  
**[1:09:07-1:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:07):**  than I can be.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:08):**  And I can only imagine what a joy your journey has been  
**[1:09:12-1:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:12):**  in this last 15 years from your,  
**[1:09:14-1:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:14):**  I think it was around 2006 that you made your big switch  
**[1:09:17-1:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:17):**  and opened your eyes to this whole new world  
**[1:09:20-1:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:20):**  and what a journey you've been on.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:21):**  And so I would love to just hear for a moment  
**[1:09:24-1:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:24):**  what that spiritual awakening has been for you  
**[1:09:26-1:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:26):**  and how that's affected not just you,  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:29):**  but probably your family and generations to come  
**[1:09:32-1:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:32):**  that are learning from you.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:34):**  Well, I would echo your comments that ultimately,  
**[1:09:38-1:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:38):**  I believe what we as humans, what we as people really desire  
**[1:09:43-1:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:43):**  is we desire connection, we desire to see and to be seen  
**[1:09:48-1:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:48):**  and to be accepted.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:51):**  And I think, of course, growing up in an Amish community  
**[1:09:55-1:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:55):**  from a very much from a Judeo-Christian worldview  
**[1:09:58-1:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:58):**  perspective, I've very much come to appreciate  
**[1:10:02-1:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:02):**  the different parts of the scripture  
**[1:10:05-1:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:05):**  that talk about co-creation.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:08):**  And ultimately, if we believe that,  
**[1:10:10-1:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:10):**  if we truly believe that we are the sons and daughters  
**[1:10:13-1:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:13):**  of God, then the extension of that,  
**[1:10:17-1:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:17):**  I believe that creation is not something that happened  
**[1:10:20-1:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:20):**  just at one moment in time in the beginning,  
**[1:10:23-1:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:23):**  but it's something that happens new every day.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:25):**  Every day is a new creation, each moment is a new creation.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:29):**  And as the sons and daughters of God, as co-creators,  
**[1:10:33-1:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:33):**  it is our gift, our opportunity and our responsibility  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:38):**  to co-create the reality that we desire to see here on Earth.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:42):**  And when I say co-create, I'm speaking of co-creation  
**[1:10:46-1:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:46):**  with God, but also co-creation with all the other  
**[1:10:51-1:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:51):**  living organisms, the plants, the animals and everything  
**[1:10:54-1:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:54):**  that we are surrounded with that he has put here  
**[1:10:56-1:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:56):**  on this Earth for us.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:57):**  We can co-create even on Earth with the knowledge  
**[1:11:02-1:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:02):**  and the wisdom that we already have that he has given us.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:05):**  We simply need to stop abusing the system.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:07):**  Yeah, that's beautifully said, that is beautifully said.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:10):**  In the end, as a physician and as somebody  
**[1:11:16-1:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:16):**  that's increasingly around farmers,  
**[1:11:18-1:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:18):**  I find that life is so eloquent in its simplicity  
**[1:11:22-1:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:22):**  in the end, which is life on Earth is always marching  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:25):**  towards more biodiversity and more cooperative creation.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:29):**  And so what you just described there is really the nature  
**[1:11:33-1:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:33):**  of life itself, it always wants more diversity  
**[1:11:36-1:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:36):**  and it always wants more abundance from that diversity  
**[1:11:40-1:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:40):**  cooperative relationship and efforts.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:43):**  And I'm so excited for the potential that successful  
**[1:11:47-1:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:47):**  transition to a global regenerative agricultural system  
**[1:11:50-1:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:50):**  would then lay the foundation for a regenerative economy,  
**[1:11:54-1:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:54):**  for regenerative transportation and energy sector,  
**[1:11:57-1:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:57):**  for regenerative socioeconomic and political system.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:00):**  We should realize that whether it be spiritual diversity  
**[1:12:06-1:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:06):**  or religious diversity views or political diversity,  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:10):**  it's gonna give life when we embrace the diversity  
**[1:12:12-1:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:12):**  for it rather than fight against those that we see  
**[1:12:16-1:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:16):**  different from ourselves.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:17):**  And so in the same way that we have turned our warlike  
**[1:12:20-1:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:20):**  mentality against Mother Earth and her microbes,  
**[1:12:24-1:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:24):**  we are turning our warlike mentality against one another  
**[1:12:28-1:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:28):**  and we need to see the end of that if we frankly deserve  
**[1:12:31-1:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:31):**  to survive past this pending extinction crisis  
**[1:12:36-1:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:36):**  that we're in.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:37):**  If we're going to survive, we need a new relationship  
**[1:12:40-1:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:40):**  that loses that warlike mentality.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:43):**  Ultimately, there is no me and you, there is just me  
**[1:12:47-1:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:47):**  and another aspect of me.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:49):**  When we truly consider and embrace the idea that all of us  
**[1:12:53-1:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:53):**  are connected and all of us are one, then that gives us  
**[1:12:58-1:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:58):**  a whole new respect and appreciation for everything  
**[1:13:01-1:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:01):**  that is creation.  
**[1:13:03-1:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:03):**  That's beautiful.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:04):**  Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons I love hanging out  
**[1:13:07-1:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:07):**  with you, John, is because in that sense of singularity,  
**[1:13:11-1:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:11):**  in that sense of we are one, I get so tired of listening  
**[1:13:17-1:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:17):**  to my own voice, I get so tired of hearing myself  
**[1:13:20-1:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:20):**  and then when I hear you say things, I'm like,  
**[1:13:23-1:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:23):**  I think I might have said that recently, but it sure sounds  
**[1:13:25-1:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:25):**  better coming out of your head.  
**[1:13:27-1:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:27):**  And so I'm just so relieved to have that sense of like,  
**[1:13:31-1:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:31):**  consciousness is something that we're all tapping into now  
**[1:13:34-1:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:34):**  and we always have and I think we are being called  
**[1:13:37-1:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:37):**  or given the opportunity to tap into this awareness of life,

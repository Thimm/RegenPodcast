**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  Welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  Mostly on this podcast, we focus on solutions.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:09):**  That is not coming from a place of necessarily desiring  to avoid the problems or avoid having a conversation  about the problems, but simply coming from the place  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:17):**  that I believe it's much more powerful to be for something  than it is to be against something.  About a decade ago, I spent a lot of time studying  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:26):**  and talking about the challenges of pesticides  in our environment, how they were impacting  the soil microbiome, how they were impacting human health.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:36):**  Since then, it's not a conversation  that I've had very much or one that I've already spent  a lot of time talking about or thinking about,  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:43):**  because again, I believe it's more powerful  to be focusing on the solutions.  Yet in the last couple of years,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:50):**  actually within the last couple of months,  I've had lots of questions of people trying to understand  why is glyphosate really a bad deal?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:00:58):**  So in this conversation, I'm very honored  to have Zach Bush here with us today.  We will be starting this discussion  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:06):**  by describing some of the challenges  that really are happening in our agricultural landscapes  with the use of pesticides and with glyphosate in particular.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:17):**  And then we do want to also shift the conversation  to focusing on the possibilities, the opportunities,  the potential to really shift and change  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:26):**  and produce a much different outcome.  So Zach, thank you very much for joining us.  I've been looking forward to this conversation.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:33):**  I'd love to hear your perspective.  Really, let's start with glyphosate  and let's start with pesticides.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:41):**  Why is glyphosate damaging?  Excellent, happy to be on with you, John.  You've been a force to be reckoned with in this whole space,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:01:50):**  bringing great resources, consulting expertise,  and real assets in the form of regenerative inputs  to the entire community of the US and beyond.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:02):**  So thank you for your hard work over the last decades.  And my entry into the glyphosate world was very indirect.  My background as a medical doctor  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:11):**  was in chemotherapy development, areas of expertise  in endocrinology and metabolism, internal medicine,  hospital-based care, as well as outpatient management  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:20):**  of hormone disorders, got involved in chemotherapy  and cancer research, as that was where the money was at  in academia that could fund my meager salary  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:31):**  as a academic teacher there.  But it was an interesting timeframe  because the world of cancer was changing  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:39):**  in that the age-old belief that this was a genetic injury  and a genetic predisposition was really transforming rapidly  in the 2005 kind of timeframe  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:49):**  where we were starting to get incredible amount  of genomic data suggesting that gut microbiome,  the bacteria and fungi living within us were predicting  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:02:59):**  whether or not cancer would occur.  In fact, could even predict what type of cancers  could occur depending on what types of perturbations  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:06):**  were in that microbiome ecosystem.  And so that was really disruptive to our understanding  and status quo of cancer research and cancer physiology.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:17):**  And in that journey, started working  with vitamin A compounds and finding  that these nutritional elements were having a huge impact  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:25):**  on the ability of cancer cells to remove themselves  from the body and it's called a process called apoptosis  or programmed cell suicide.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:33):**  So it was a very exciting time to realize  that maybe there was a future for cancer management  where we weren't poisoning tumors,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:39):**  but we're actually giving them nutrients  that would increase their capacity for cell-cell signaling  and induction of apoptosis or programmed cell suicide  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:49):**  to clean up the cancer independent  of the human immune system  or other elements of human biology.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:03:54):**  And so it was really an exciting potential  transformative moment.  And in that, we saw the big recession happen in 2008  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:03):**  and academia really collapsed.  Our division of endocrinologist went from 75 faculty  down to about 25 over a very short period of time.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:11):**  And pharmaceutical companies grabbed up most of that talent.  I ended up departing university at that time  and started a nutrition center for reversing chronic disease  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:21):**  and that's how I found my way into this topic of glyphosate  that you're asking about.  So from that medical standpoint,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:28):**  I was looking at small chemicals as the solution  for many, many years.  And when we started working with small compounds  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:35):**  made by bacteria and fungi in the soil and the gut,  it was alarming to find out that these bacteria and fungi  could actually make medicine.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:44):**  They could make things that could repair the human body.  And in the end, we found that the biggest thing  that they were in opposition to  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:04:51):**  was this chemical glyphosate that you mentioned.  And glyphosate has now recognized worldwide  as being kind of a flashpoint of controversy  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:01):**  with a huge multi-billion dollar agricultural system  continuing to insist to regulatory bodies around the world  that this is a safe compound.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:09):**  Their old cash term was of course safer than water.  This mentality of this can kill weeds  but somehow doesn't kill people was an alchemy  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:18):**  we couldn't figure out in the soil and plant system.  How does a plant take these chemicals of herbicides  and pesticides that are killing bacteria and fungi  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:28):**  and beyond and then suddenly turn them  into benign compounds?  And the way in which that was justified to the world  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:36):**  was through suggesting that the mechanism of glyphosate  in regards to its weed killing power was through blocking  an enzyme pathway called the shikimate pathway.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:46):**  And the unique thing about this is it doesn't exist  in humans, it doesn't exist in any animal out there.  And so this was told to us as the rationale  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:05:55):**  for why this chemical could kill plants, fungi,  and bacteria but wouldn't hurt your livestock  or your pet or your children  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:04):**  was because we didn't have this enzyme pathway  that was its target.  And so that was how I think it was justified  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:09):**  through the system but what we weren't recognizing  by that very story was that glyphosate was blocking  an enzyme pathway, the shikimate pathway  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:18):**  that was crucial to the health of humanity  and animal life that's consuming the plants  that have been treated with this chemical.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:26):**  And what it's doing is undermining the ability  for bacteria, fungi, and plants to produce  the aromatic amino acids.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:34):**  These are a portion of the essential amino acids.  Recall that there's 22 amino acids  that build the human body and of those 22,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:44):**  there are nine that we call essential amino acids  that cannot be manufactured by the human body  because we lack the enzyme pathways.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:50):**  And some of those nine are represented  in these essential amino acids made  through the shikimate pathway.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:06:57):**  If Monsanto was right, this was the only way  that this toxin worked, perhaps there wasn't  a direct target towards human health  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:03):**  if that was the limitation of its effect  but there was certainly an indirect effect  that would occur if we started growing all of our food  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:10):**  under the pressure of a chemical that blocked  the ability of that food to make the essential protein  building blocks that our body can't produce.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:18):**  And so that was the beginning of a real destructive quality  to this thing as it undermined the building blocks  for proteins across all biology and certainly kills weeds  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:29):**  quickly for eliminating those essential amino acids  and subsequently we start to develop deficiencies  as human beings in essential amino acids  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:37):**  produced by the microbiome of the soils  and ultimately a reduction in our microbiome  as just like it does in soil,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:44):**  the residues of glyphosate in our food and water systems  are now ingested and killing, acting as an antibiotic  to the microbiome of our gut  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:07:52):**  and so we become deficient there.  And so we are really undermining the health of soils  and gut performance in humans, animals,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:01):**  and all the way down to the earthworm  with this disruption of an antibiotic  that's now infused into our system.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:08):**  You've described this indirect effect of glyphosate  limiting the synthesis of these essential amino acids  that we require and that animals require.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:16):**  How does glyphosate impact our bodies directly if at all?  Yeah, so this is what was not told to us  by the chemical companies,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:25):**  but our laboratory has been working on it  for the last eight years is that  what is the direct consequences of Roundup  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:31):**  in the human biology?  And it turns out it very rapidly destroys protein structure  in the extracellular matrix  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:39):**  as well as in the intracellular system  and that has huge consequences for everything  from the way in which cells feed themselves,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:47):**  the metabolism of fuel,  all the way down to detoxification and repair  and regeneration systems within the cell,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:08:53):**  specifically the mitochondria within those cells  which are like little bacteria  that are capable of producing energy for the human cell.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:00):**  Those are also influenced by the toxicity  of this antimicrobial.  And so the mitochondria within us  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:06):**  and the bacteria and fungi that support human cellular life  throughout the whole organ system of the body  is now recognized to be a direct target for glyphosate.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:16):**  And so when it starts to denature the proteins  in your gut lining, for example,  you start to develop a leak  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:23):**  and the proteins function sort of like Velcro  holding one epithelial cell, boundary cell  to the next to create this huge gut barrier  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:33):**  that is the largest surface area  that exposes you to the outside world.  It's two tennis courts in the surface area.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:39):**  And that gut lining made up of billions of epithelial cells  that are smaller than about half the width of a human hair.  Those little guys now bound together in billions  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:49):**  will cover those two tennis courts and surface area  and it's the Velcro that holds them  into that coherent system.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:09:56):**  When the Velcro is damaged directly by glyphosate,  we see leak start to develop across the system.  And once you're starting that gut leak,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:04):**  you're now overwhelming the immune system  with every glass of water or a bite of food you eat,  not only with the chemicals and the heavy metals  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:12):**  and other things that are infused  into much of our food system today,  but also the organic compounds  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:17):**  such as insoluble fiber of kale,  which should be one of the best anti-cancer compounds  in the body can actually become an inflammatory nadis  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:27):**  if it sneaks through that gut lining inappropriately.  And so that leaky gut becomes the source  for chronic inflammation.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:34):**  And now if you've been keeping up  with the human health literature,  it's very hard to find one of our chronic diseases  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:40):**  that's gone epidemic over the years,  whether we're talking about autism and asthma  and allergies in children,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:45):**  or Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancer in adults,  the whole spectrum has now been mapped back  to disruption of the gut  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:10:53):**  and chronic inflammation and pursuing.  So we see glyphosate now as really the gatekeeper event  or this slippery slope  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:00):**  into this chronic inflammatory state within the body.  And we can show this on very detailed population maps  that the higher the concentrations of glyphosate  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:09):**  in your environment, the more likely you are  to have immune dysfunction and chronic disease  in the population they're in,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:15):**  ultimately high cancer rates.  In the United States,  we see that best exemplified in the Mississippi River,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:21):**  which collects about 80, 85% of the water soluble residues  of Roundup and the last 90 miles of that Mississippi River  running between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:32):**  is called cancer alley,  highest rates of cancer in the entire developed world.  So a really terrifying quality to this disruptive nature  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:40):**  of not just destroying the microbiome and its support,  but then destroying the self identity  of the human or animal in that it loses that boundary event,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:51):**  what's inside, what's outside and the like.  You mentioned glyphosate as an antibiotic  and the impact that it has on the microbiome.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:11:59):**  We know that it's patented as an antibiotic of course.  What are the concentrations that are required  to have this effect on our microbiome?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah, the concentrations can be quite small.  So you're down in the two parts per billion  to five parts per billion levels.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:15):**  And this is what you would typically see  in a lot of water systems around the country and the like.  At a thousand fold that concentration,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:23):**  you're up in the two parts per million  to 20 parts per million.  That's what you're commonly seeing on root vegetables  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:29):**  and other conventionally grown crops out there.  Beets can be as high as 20 parts per million  in the grocery store.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:35):**  And so you're a thousand fold the detectable level of damage  once you're at the grocery store.  If you get into livestock feed and pet food,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:45):**  you're now often in the 400 parts per million  or even thousand parts per million of glyphosate.  And so you're up many hundred thousand times  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:12:53):**  that of its lowest threshold for damage.  And so certainly functioning as an antibiotic,  it doesn't take much to disrupt the ecosystem balance.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:03):**  Functioning as a disruptor of protein structures,  you're down in that conventional vegetable range  is plenty to create that leaky membrane effect.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:12):**  The focus for the last few years  has really been on glyphosate as a molecule,  but I think we also need to ask the question,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:19):**  what about the adjuvants that it is associated with  and not just the adjuvants that glyphosate  is associated with,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:25):**  but the broad array of other pesticides  that are routinely used in agricultural ecosystems.  What is glyphosate being singled out?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:35):**  Is glyphosate so much worse than other pesticides?  How is it different from others that are in the environment?  I think that's an important question  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:43):**  because it's in this 30 year journey  with Roundup and glyphosate.  I think we've really had to come to terms with the fact  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:13:49):**  that we were judging toxicity by a very narrow definition.  And so Roundup came on the scene in the mid 1970s  to replace chemicals like atrazine  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:00):**  that were known carcinogens,  very damaging to respiratory systems.  There was a sense of, oh, this is the newer, safer compound.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:07):**  And so regulatory committees around the world  raced to get this thing approved  because it worked so effectively  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:12):**  and was so much less toxic  in our current understanding of that word.  The reason why atrazine looks more toxic  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:18):**  is because it can do direct cellular damage to membranes.  It can do direct damage to DNA and all of that kind of stuff.  So it kind of fits our more classic model of cancer  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:28):**  and carcinogenic features to it.  In contrast, in the 1970s,  we had no idea that the microbiome  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:34):**  was actually at the real foundation of cancer.  We thought it was direct DNA damage  that was doing cancer risk.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:40):**  And so we didn't understand at the time  that we were really undermining biological life  by switching from an atrazine direct toxin  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:47):**  to this indirect antimicrobial disruptor  of amino acid building blocks  and all these kind of long-term indirect features  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:14:55):**  that we wouldn't really discover  until a generation into the journey.  And generation is measured by about 23, 25 years.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:03):**  And so by 25 years in that journey,  we're hitting year 2000,  and we suddenly realized that we were in an epidemic  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:10):**  of autoimmune disease that had really kicked up  by 1996, 98.  We were in an epidemic of neurologic disorder in children  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:16):**  with a huge rise in autism,  attention deficit hyperactivity disorders,  sleeping disorders, mood disorders in children,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:23):**  anxiety and depression disorders.  The whole gamut was going crazy by that one generation in.  And we now know from generational mouse studies  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:33):**  that there is a cumulative epigenetic effect to this injury,  meaning that if you injure generation one  with a small amount of Roundup injected under the skin,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:43):**  just a little pocket of it,  there's no measurable damage to that mouse.  They go on to have normal pups,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:48):**  they go on to have a normal lifespan.  However, generation two, not exposed to Roundup,  but came from mom who was exposed to Roundup,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:15:56):**  has significant issues with metabolic disorders,  immune dysfunction, and has shortened lifespan.  The third generation, again, not exposed directly,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:06):**  but indirectly to grandma now,  that indirect grandmother epigenetic pattern  is now manifesting cancers and stillbirths  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:15):**  in that third generation.  So there's this really terrifying cumulative effect  that happens generationally from this exposure to Roundup.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:24):**  And so I'm very concerned that we're heading  into the third generation of children under Roundup  just in the next five years.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:31):**  And so in the next five years,  I think we're gonna see the real epidemic declare itself  in its full potential as we move from 2025 to 2035.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:41):**  And currently we're already in an exponential growth  of these chronic conditions in children.  We've gone from an average of 1.5% of children  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:51):**  with a chronic disease in the 1960s  before the advent of Roundup to our current situation  where 52% of children in the United States  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:16:59):**  screened by Medicaid surveys  are now with a chronic disease.  And so we have this devastating impact on human health  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:08):**  in what is certainly the most advanced  and most expensive medical system in the world.  We are not succeeding in preventing this level of disease  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:17):**  within our children.  We're literally building entire cities.  Texas Children's Hospital in Houston,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:22):**  good example of this is skyscrapers on skyscrapers  on skyscrapers, literally tower after tower  of Children's Hospital housing our kids with cancer  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:33):**  and severe autoimmune diseases  and all of these horrible conditions.  And so if we're building cities to house our sick children  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:40):**  and not getting at the realization of what we've done,  we've got a real state of denial.  And unfortunately that's very much  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:47):**  what I think we have at the regulatory level.  You've made the comment that we're on track to go extinct  as a species in the next 70 years.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:17:54):**  What was the basis for that comment?  Was it additional factors other than just glyphosate  or specifically glyphosate?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:01):**  I would say glyphosate is public enemy number one  in that it's been our widest spread antibiotic  on the planet.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:08):**  We now know that human life is dependent upon  a diverse microbiome ecosystem of fungi and bacteria,  parasites, protozoa, the whole spectrum.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:17):**  We need all of those guys for healthy soil,  healthy plants, healthy life.  And we've undermined that with this most ubiquitous  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:24):**  of chemicals now.  We're somewhere around four billion pounds  of this chemical used worldwide every year now.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:31):**  The amount used globally has roughly doubled every six years  for the last 35 years.  And so we've had this explosive and constant rise  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:41):**  in this antimicrobial pressure that has devastated  the health of our livestock,  has devastated the health of our children,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:47):**  and has certainly devastated the health of the planet.  The 70 year estimate is actually very specific,  not just to the rise of chronic disease,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:18:56):**  which to give a sense of it,  where we're heading for 2035 right now  is that one in three children in the United States  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:03):**  will have an autism spectrum disorder.  And so if you start to then map that forward,  what is the productivity of that generation  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:10):**  that has one in three children on the spectrum?  What is the cost of care to that generation?  What is the lost productivity of their parents  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:18):**  and grandparents and aunts and uncles  that are trying to contribute to daycare  and in-home care and the cost of institutional care?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:26):**  It just starts to, you realize,  even with that one condition,  we could completely destroy the economy of the United States  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:33):**  through just healthcare costs.  Then you add in 80% of adults with cancer by 2035,  and you realize we've got a completely  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:40):**  insoluble state of health.  All of that said, that's not really how you map out  the prediction of extinction.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:46):**  For extinction, you need to undermine fertility.  And that's what we've done simultaneous.  So since the advent of glyphosate,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:19:54):**  and again, as you've said,  there's many different chemicals and radiation exposures,  cell phones, cell phone towers,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:01):**  as well as Bluetooth devices in this coming 5G era  and everything else.  There's certainly many, many things  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:09):**  that are disrupting biologic function.  And so we can look at that as a cohesive toxic stew,  if you will, and then look at its impact on fertility.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:18):**  And in the United States and other Western countries,  we've seen a decline between 52% and 57% in sperm counts  in males over that period of time,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:27):**  so since the mid 1970s.  And so with a 52 to 57% decline in sperm counts,  we now have one in three males in Western countries  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:35):**  that are infertile due to a lack of production of sperm.  That's an extraordinary statistic,  one in three males now infertile.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:42):**  And then you look across to the female biology  and you find that it's nearly the identical number.  You've got one in four women that are affected  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:50):**  with just the condition of polycystic ovarian syndrome,  and then you have a whole host of other conditions  that contribute to the additional women  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:20:57):**  to reach this kind of one in three  with infertile or poor fertility state.  And so those are the numbers that as you extrapolate them  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:04):**  out with the rising curves of toxicity in the soils  and more importantly, perhaps for our survival,  the toxicity of our oceans and water systems,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:14):**  you start to realize we've got about eight years  before we tip off to a crisis level of biology  within water and soil systems and expect an acceleration  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:24):**  in this already extraordinary decline in fertility.  And so the extinction event will happen through  an acceleration of chronic disease  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:32):**  coupled with this total loss of fertility  within the species.  And that's not specific to humans obviously.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:38):**  We've seen 50% of life wiped off the face of the planet  in the last 40 or 50 years.  And so there's been many books written on this  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:47):**  and everything else.  We're in the midst of the sixth great extinction  on planet right now.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:51):**  And this time, this is from the cataclysmic event  that we call a human.  Other cataclysmic events that have caused widespread death  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:21:58):**  of species across the world have always tied back  to soil and water destruction.  Typically it's an asteroid that covers the earth  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:06):**  with a layer of dust, disrupts the respiratory system  of the planet.  You end up with CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere,  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:12):**  you acidify the oceans, and then you get widespread  87 to 97% wipeout of life on earth.  That's happened five previous times.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:20):**  And so the sixth time, we're now the great destructive force  that's destroying our soil systems,  causing the accumulation of CO2, methane,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:28):**  and other carbon substrates into the atmosphere,  which are then acidifying the oceans  through the same process.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:33):**  And so we've seen this cycle many times.  And so mapping out an extinction event  doesn't have to be theoretical.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:39):**  We have a lot of data in the fossil record  and a lot of data around what's currently happening  over the last 40 years to understand how we're undermining  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:47):**  and how this rolls out over the next few decades.  Zach, what resources can you recommend for people  who want to learn more?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:22:55):**  There's obviously resources about the extinction events  that you've been describing in the fossil record  and so forth, but specifically to this human causation,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:04):**  the impact of pesticides, autism, cancer,  rising medical costs, infertility, et cetera.  Has this information been organized and pulled together  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:12):**  into one coherent and easy to read analysis anywhere?  I hope not, because that's the book I'm writing right now.  But honestly, there's a ton of great books out there  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:24):**  that touch on this from different perspectives.  I think the work that was done with the two books,  one is called Sapiens,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:32):**  and then the follow-up was called Homo Deus.  Those two books, I think,  really give a really interesting look  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:38):**  at the history of where we've been as a species  and where we're heading as a species  in regards to our own extinction.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:45):**  Those books do not have any reference  to the agricultural chemicals as we've been talking here,  but a good understanding of where we stand  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:23:52):**  in the history of mankind and the planet as a whole.  In regards to the reading for specific injury  of glyphosate on human systems,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:01):**  I think Stephanie Sanneff has done some of the best work  in the country in publishing a lot of peer-reviewed papers  on the topic.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:09):**  She's a computer scientist out of MIT.  She actually was the director of AI at MIT  in the 1980s and 90s, incredibly brilliant woman.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:19):**  And by 1998, she was starting to pick up  mathematical patterns in the epidemics of chronic disease  that were pointing to some drastic change  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:26):**  in the environment.  And she was the first one to really identify glyphosate  as that smoking gun to accelerate all of this  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:35):**  that we've been talking about.  So Sanneff is S-E-N-N-E-F there, and Stephanie's got  a great spectrum of papers out there  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:42):**  if you wanna dive deeper into that.  One of the criticisms that I've heard about Stephanie's work  and about this general conversation  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:24:51):**  of implicating glyphosate in particular  and agricultural chemicals in general  is the whole conversation about correlation  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:00):**  versus causation.  What is your response to correlation versus causation?  Super important.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:05):**  Yeah, no, that's exactly super important.  So that's what our lab has brought in over the last  seven years is really the causation piece.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:13):**  She's been doing phenomenal work,  understanding the theoretical models  as to how glyphosate is disrupting protein structures  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:20):**  and all of that.  But our lab is the first to really identify  how that's being done and where in the body  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:25):**  is that protein disruption happening  specifically around the gut lining and the like.  We've also shown gut brain injury  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:32):**  with the blood brain barrier directly damaged  by these systems as well.  So we've got a bunch of white papers  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:38):**  and peer reviewed science that can be found  on ionbiome.com, I-O-N-B-I-O-M-E, ionbiome.com.  Thanks for sharing those references.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:48):**  Can you give us a verbal overview  in addition to those papers,  can you give us a verbal overview  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:25:53):**  of the work that you've done in your lab  and what you've been learning and discovering?  Yeah, so our first work was done looking at  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:01):**  the direct influence of glyphosate on those boundaries  of the tight junctions as they're referred to.  Tight junctions are those Velcro-like proteins,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:10):**  complex structures, there's about 13 different proteins  that are involved in a tight junction  anchoring one cell to the next.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:17):**  And they act as intelligent gatekeepers.  So they actually allow macromolecules  and things like soluble fiber  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:23):**  and other large carbohydrates  to cross between the epithelial boundary  so that they don't have to be transported through the cell.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:31):**  So it's an intelligent gatekeeper system  and we were the first lab to show  the direct effects of glyphosate disrupting that Velcro.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:38):**  And we've also shown in those  that there's a phenotypic change  or a change in the characteristics of those cells  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:45):**  once they fall apart.  They've quickly moved to a kind of precancerous state.  They appear much smaller than they were  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:26:53):**  in the healthy state just moments before they broke apart.  They have a characteristic shrinkage of the cytoplasm  or fluid within the cell.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:01):**  And that's one of the hallmarks  of kind of a precancerous cells.  Then we see a drop in their capacity  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:07):**  to make a reactive oxygen species or stress signaling.  And we've shown that you're losing  that kind of mitochondrial potential  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:15):**  at the same time that you're losing that boundary event.  We've gone on to show that there's synergy  between gluten injury at that gut lining  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:24):**  and glyphosate demonstrating that  we really didn't have gluten sensitivity  in any significant amount in the population until 1992  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:33):**  when we started spraying wheat directly with glyphosate.  And we've shown the mechanism by which glyphosate  and gluten synergistically disrupt that tight junction.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:42):**  And so that paper's out there  one of our first publications there  and that synergy between gluten and glyphosate  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:48):**  to induce gluten sensitivity.  Many people who've experienced gluten sensitivity  or friends that do almost everybody's now one degree  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:27:56):**  of separation from somebody who's got gluten sensitivity  will find that if they go to Europe  or another environment where there's no use  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:03):**  of glyphosate in the wheat systems,  you don't see the same symptoms that are associated  with what we call gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:11):**  The conclusion of that is really that  we don't really have gluten sensitivity,  we have glyphosate toxicity.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:16):**  And when you have glyphosate toxicity,  then things like gluten and even in our clinic,  we found even things like kale can become pro-inflammatory  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:24):**  and cause bloating and pain and inflammation signals  and symptoms in human patients  that have that leaky gut injury.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:33):**  And so that has been an interesting look  at how healthy grains and foods  that have been in the diet for thousands of years  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:40):**  can suddenly become noxious to us.  And in the same way, you can see the effects of children  who are now allergic to so many foods and systems.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:48):**  So it used to be when I was growing up,  there was one kid in our entire school of 800 kids  that had a peanut allergy.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:28:54):**  And so there was one EpiPen and the nurse's thing  with his name on it.  Now, if you go into a nurse's office,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:01):**  you've got many dozens of EpiPens with different allergies  from everything from pollen to dust mites,  to cat dander and everything else,  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:09):**  all the way down to the foods of avocados and eggs  and seeds and all kinds of things  that they're deathly allergic to now.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:17):**  And so as we see that erosion of that,  we see the rise of that immune dysfunction there.  So that's all tied up in that causation effect  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:25):**  that you're inquiring about.  I'm very excited to see Stephanie's work of 30 years  start to really be supported by these causation studies  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:33):**  to show that she was indeed right in her modeling.  It is remarkable when you start to think about the idea,  the phrase of food allergy put together as a common phrase.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:46):**  It should give us pause to stop and ask the question,  why would people be allergic to food?  Why should people be allergic to food?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:29:52):**  They should not, of course.  Exactly, and I'm always dumbfounded by my own career.  Like, we are not taught to ask those questions  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:01):**  as physicians, it's so bizarre.  Like, in deeper than the question of,  why are kids allergic to food?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:07):**  The next or more extreme version of that is,  why are children unable to breathe?  And we've got one in eight children with asthma  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:15):**  in the United States, Australia, UK,  and so one in eight children can't breathe.  You've got one in four children that can't eat or breathe  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:25):**  without having an allergic reaction.  It's just a totally astounding demonstration  of the extreme disruption that we've done to human biology,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:34):**  such that we can't even live on planet earth anymore  without immune dysfunction and rapid aging.  And so we are really seeing the destruction of a planet.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:42):**  I think back to those science fiction Star Trek episodes  that I would catch at a friend's house  when I was a kid or something,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:50):**  and it was like mind blowing to see these,  think about these other planets  and exploring the solar systems  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:30:56):**  and seeing plants that could or could not support life,  and some had oxygen, some didn't,  some had water, some didn't.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:01):**  You know, this concept,  well, we're about to create a planet  that doesn't have water or soil systems  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:06):**  that support biologic life and human existence.  And so we really are creating a Martian landscape  that's inhospitable to our own species  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:17):**  as we continue to destroy the ecosystem around us.  Our biggest agricultural export is topsoil  sent to the tune of 75 billion tons per year.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:27):**  And that is, it gives us,  I think recall the math correctly,  that gives us in the remaining 60 cropping years  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:33):**  until the topsoil will be completely gone.  Yep, you're exactly right on that.  That 60 years was an astounding number  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:40):**  because I just heard that only like three or four years ago  from Alan Williams was blown away by that statistic  because it maps so darn close  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:49):**  to the human expiration date of 70 years, you know?  And it just really drew a fine point on the reality  that we're not talking  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:31:57):**  about some theoretical human extinction.  We're talking about the lack of capacity  for the planet to make life happen.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:05):**  And the topsoil is absolutely where that has to occur.  That is ground zero, no pun intended, or maybe pun intended.  That is ground zero of our survival state.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:14):**  If we cannot regenerate soils,  if we cannot reverse the cycle of soil loss,  we do not have life on earth.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:22):**  It's not just the bees that are going extinct.  It's not just the humans.  There will be a complete loss of multicellular organisms,  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:29):**  mammals, et cetera, as we go down that path.  I think the exciting aspect of what you just said,  that our largest loss or export, if you will,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:40):**  in this country is that massive soil devastation.  We're losing somewhere around two tons of topsoil per acre  per 125 million acres of farmland  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:50):**  in the United States right now.  If you add the cost of that resource up,  you're looking at about 11%  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:32:56):**  of our gross domestic product every year  being flushed down rivers and into oceans  to choke out coral reefs  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:03):**  and destroy ecosystems in those spaces.  11% of our GDP lost in soil resources every year.  And so the reason why I get excited about that number  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:13):**  is that's real to politicians,  that's real to economists and economy forecasters,  it's real to the fundamental consumer product industry  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:22):**  that's relying on production of those soils  to fuel their plastics industry or their fuel industry.  Our commodities crops are by and large  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:32):**  not going into food anymore.  They're going towards these oil-based products  like apparel and hospital equipment  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:40):**  and packaging for consumer goods and all of this.  If we start to show this direct fiscal financial loss,  I think that it's a different avenue  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:51):**  into the minds of the powers that be  around money management in this country.  And I think we're seeing an adjustment.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:33:57):**  I think we're seeing an enormous explosion of interest  in impact investment funds and regenerative agriculture  and regen supply systems and everything else.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:06):**  And certainly this whole pandemic  that we've just been through  has put a very fine point on it.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:11):**  We've lost hundreds of millions of jobs worldwide.  We've pushed an estimated 125 million households  into financial crisis  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:19):**  with another 125 million households joining them  within the next four weeks if we don't get things going,  which it looks like we won't.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:27):**  And so 250 million households  being pressed into crisis financially  and having a sense also of the fragile supply chain  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:36):**  of the current mega industry approach to food systems.  And so I'm very excited to see these kind of fiscal numbers  rather than just the biologic concept we put on this.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:47):**  I think it's more palatable and feels more real  to a lot of the decision makers in our economy.  We've been focusing our conversation so far  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:34:56):**  on the challenges of glyphosate,  but one of the pieces that really got me  and started down this pathway over a decade ago  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:02):**  was the realization that the majority of ag pesticides  that are used and sprayed on our landscape  are significant endocrine disruptors.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:10):**  In fact, many of the insecticides and so forth  function as endocrine disruptors  and the implications of what that means  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:18):**  for our own endocrine system  and the very infinitesimally small quantities  that are required to be significant disruptors.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:27):**  Could you offer your perspective  and share your perspective on what it means  for our bodies to be disrupted by endocrine disruptors  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:34):**  and what is really required  and the impact that ag pesticides can have in that context?  Yeah, it's an interesting reality  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:43):**  because once you open up that gut lining with glyphosate,  you now are opening the path for innumerable chemicals  and toxins to come in after it.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:35:52):**  And some of the most ubiquitous of those  is actually the plastics and long chain petroleum products  that we see in chemical agriculture  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:02):**  and like our fertilizer systems.  And so as we develop these small  and long chain molecule resources for agricultural system,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:11):**  as well as our consumer packaged goods  and all the other ways we use plastics,  and then you add Roundup to the system,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:17):**  you've opened up the gate, if you will,  and all of those go pouring into the human system.  The endocrine system is a really elaborate system  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:26):**  of feedback loops and communication networks  within the body that coordinate the behavior  of some 70 trillion human cells,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:34):**  and then figure out their relationship  and response to around 1.4 quadrillion bacteria,  14 quadrillion mitochondria.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:44):**  The numbers are just absolutely staggering  in the symphony that happens in a healthy biologic system.  And as you introduce these endocrine disruptors  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:36:55):**  of plastics and small chemical molecules  from the agricultural system,  you start to plug up all sorts  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:01):**  of these cycles of communication,  and you gum up the mechanisms of metabolism  or fuel production.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:09):**  And so one of the first steps that we see is fatty liver.  Fatty liver is one of the most established side effects  of glyphosate in our food and water systems.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:17):**  It's now the leading cause of hepatitis in the country  as fatty liver from nutritional sources  rather than from viral sources as seen in the past  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:24):**  with hepatitis C and the like.  Over the last 10 years, we've seen nutritional sources  of these endocrine disruptors  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:30):**  become the leading cause of liver failure.  We've seen chronic kidney disease rise in the world  to be the number one chronic disease  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:38):**  represented globally right now.  And that again is through the disruption  of the tight junction protein structure  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:45):**  that we see with glyphosate disruption of the kidneys,  but it's also caused by a disruption  in this incredibly eloquent hormonal communication network  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:37:55):**  between human bone, bloodstream, fat cells, and kidneys  and how they are channeled to do detoxification for us  and improve resource management.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:06):**  All of that gets disrupted  and we start to leak like a sieve at the kidney level.  And so with this endocrine disruption,  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:13):**  you start to undermine the way nutrients are delivered  through the liver and how toxins are cleared  through the kidneys and how resources are reclaimed  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:21):**  by the kidneys to make sure we're maintaining  our resource reservoirs appropriately.  Protein is a good example.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:27):**  As the kidney damage happens through glyphosate  plus the endocrine disruption effects,  you start to dump protein into the urine  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:34):**  at a very high level.  And so you're losing the most important asset  that the body has, which are the amino acids  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:41):**  and protein structures that it's worked so hard to build.  And so the endocrine disruption really can't be underestimated  in its effect.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:49):**  It's certainly underpinning this whole drop in testosterone,  drop in sperm counts, drop in fertility in women  with the dysregulation of insulin  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:38:57):**  and the ovary with estrogen production,  all of this leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome,  failure to ovulate, failure for fertility,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:06):**  all of this tying back.  The amount of this disruption has gotten so severe  that we can just look at a single condition  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:13):**  like hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroiditis  that's common in women more than men.  But we see it now in universal screening,  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:21):**  even as early as 2005, we were seeing one in four women,  one in four girls at age 12  with auto antibodies to our own thyroid.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:31):**  And so that's kind of the level of endocrine dysfunction  where our own endocrine system is being destroyed  by our immune system as that gut barrier  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:41):**  and that self identity is eroded by glyphosate  and all of these endocrine disruptors come flowing in behind  to disrupt the nuances of that endocrine system.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:50):**  We see chronic fatigue syndromes,  we see chronic pain syndromes,  we see hyperactivity in neurologic conditions in kids,  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:39:58):**  we see neurologic degenerative conditions  like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, ALS, MS,  all going up in their epidemic numbers  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:06):**  over the last decade and a half or two.  And so it's just staggering how many systems  have been disrupted through this kind of universal poisoning  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:16):**  of the agricultural system.  Zag, through this conversation,  you've right off the top of your head  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:22):**  mentioned a lot of staggering statistics,  quite frankly, staggering about the degrading  health condition of the population at large.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:33):**  How does the overall health condition  of the agricultural community compare  to the population at large?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:42):**  Yeah, it's a sad reality that our farmers  are really on the front lines of this toxicity, obviously.  And it was just numbers for me  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:50):**  until I started to shoot the documentary film  for our nonprofit, Farmers Footprint.  We started in Minnesota and took a two week road trip  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:40:58):**  all the way down the tributary pathway  of the Mississippi River that ends in New Orleans.  And that two week journey,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:04):**  we were sat in innumerable living rooms of farmers  and sat with families, children, et cetera.  And you couldn't find a family  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:14):**  that was growing conventional agriculture  that wasn't directly being affected by this toxicity.  Children with ADHD,  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:21):**  children with frank disorders of birth defects.  We saw children born on farms  that had failed to form their brain correctly  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:29):**  with the connection between left and right hemisphere,  a very rare disorder.  And to see a couple of those in a single road trip  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:36):**  was a big warning that, oh my gosh,  we've got this massive amount of dysfunction  at the fetal development level  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:43):**  in these toxic environments of the agricultural system.  The adults had huge amount of major depression.  Suicide has been steadily rising  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:52):**  as mood disorders are now linked to gut health  and destruction of the microbiome  from the likes of glyphosate,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:41:58):**  disrupting the amount of serotonin and dopamine  that the brain is able to receive from the gut.  90% of the serotonin is made in the gut lining,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:06):**  50% of the dopamine made in the gut lining.  And so as you destroy that gut lining with glyphosate,  you're losing that infrastructure.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:12):**  And we see that really potent in the farmers  that are out there mixing up their stews of chemicals  to treat their weed systems and all that,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:20):**  their herbicide and pesticide mixes that they now have to do  because Roundup has lost its efficacy as a single chemical.  Now that we have so much Roundup resistant weeds,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:29):**  it's a mixture typically of 2,4-D or atrazine  and glyphosate and nicotinamide and a whole stew of mess.  And those farmers are now wiping out their gut lining  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:40):**  and they're attributing their depression and suicide  to financial stress when in fact,  I believe that financial stress is as old as farming itself.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:48):**  When it comes to agriculture,  it's never been an easy business.  It's always been at the mercy of environmental changes  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:42:56):**  and environmental crises and collapses  and natural disasters and changes in the economies  and markets and everything else.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:04):**  And so never have we seen the suicide rates  that we do today.  And I don't think it can be just blamed  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:09):**  on financial stress.  I think it's a direct effect of these chemicals  on our blood brain barrier, on our gut barrier,  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:16):**  on the manufacturing capacity of neurotransmitters  at the gut lining.  So suicide is now rampant.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:22):**  We see many of the farmers that we've filmed and talked to  with their second and third cancers.  There's Cancer Alley down in New Orleans.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:32):**  Once you get down that far,  it's not unusual to find farmers that have been diagnosed  and treated for cancer five times over the last 15 years.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:39):**  And so it's just like this devastating disease capacity.  And when you walk into their kitchens,  you realize that they are starving of nutrients.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:50):**  They are literally eating frozen pizzas  that have been prepared in China  or some other far flung place of the world  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:43:57):**  and shipped and sold at ridiculously low prices of $1.99  for a Totino's pizza or something like that.  And that's dinner for a farm that owns 3000 acres  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:08):**  and then spends their entire livelihood  growing thousands of acres of supposed food crop.  And they are starving with a lack of nutrients in the home.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:16):**  And so you can see this just food desert effect.  Kansas is our most agricultural state in the union.  And I've pointed to this many times  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:24):**  because I think it's one of the most profound things  I've heard from the farmers so far,  but at Fuller Farms,  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:30):**  I think it was maybe two years ago now,  or maybe just last year,  the Fuller Farms event, a great presentation,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:36):**  it was demonstrated that Kansas,  where we were having the event  is covered in 90% agricultural system by land volume.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:44):**  And the state has to import 90% of its food.  And one in four children is going hungry each night  in Kansas for a lack of nutrients and calories.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:44:54):**  So a really devastating look at just how  we aren't feeding the world  with this chemical agricultural as we were told,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:01):**  we aren't even feeding ourselves with this thing anymore.  And as we mentioned earlier,  much of those commodity crops are now going into  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:08):**  either feed for cattle and poultry and swine,  or they're going into the ethanol for the fuel industry,  or they're going into the small molecule production  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:18):**  for the processed food industry,  like high fructose corn syrup and the like,  or small molecule oil products  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:25):**  to go into health and apparel and the rest.  So we're starving our own systems through there.  So the health and the nutrition status of these homes  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:34):**  throughout the Midwest is devastating.  And now that we've started to travel the world  with our nonprofit,  
**[0:45:40-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:40):**  we find the same phenomenon in Australia,  we've in Hawaii, certainly South America,  suffering from widespread hunger still.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:48):**  Really devastating reality for farmers today  in so many sectors.  The agribusiness marketing mantra  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:45:56):**  of needing to feed the world has certainly become  very popular in the farming community.  And I've made the comment as well,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:04):**  it's not a popular comment to make at a farm meeting  in the Midwest, but the Midwest really is  a good food desert.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:10):**  It's hard to find.  If you're traveling and you want to stay at a hotel,  the typical hotel in the Midwest,  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:17):**  the quality of food that is served  at a continental breakfast that is considered to be food  is not fit for human consumption, quite frankly.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:25):**  I completely agree.  Yeah, and it was so interesting too.  Like when we were up in Minnesota,  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:31):**  we were like our third night into this two week road trip,  we were all starting to feel sick.  Like we were all just feeling wiped out  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:38):**  and starting to feel depressed.  And frankly, we were starting to fall asleep  in the middle of conversations and stuff like that,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:45):**  just with incredible fatigue in our whole group.  And we went to the front desk,  trying to find some dinner asking,  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:46:53):**  is there any health food places around?  And these two young women at the desk looked at each other  like we had asked if there were elephants around  
**[0:47:01-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:01):**  or something like that.  They didn't even know what those two words meant  next to each other, health food.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:05):**  And they said, well, there's three restaurants.  And so they told us about the three restaurants  we could drive to.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:10):**  And we went to the one that was right on the river.  They said, it's got good fish or something, they said.  So we went there, most of our team not even eating fish,  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:20):**  we're plant-based people.  And we show up there and it is the grossest looking  salad bar you've ever seen in your life.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:28):**  Everything's fried, everything's been obliterated  from any nutrient connection back to mother nature.  And so you're absolutely right that  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:36):**  not only is there a food desert,  I think there's a memory deficit of what life would look like  if there was real food around.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:43):**  What did these farms look like in the 1950s?  Well, they all had backyard gardens that were booming  and they were feeding themselves out of their own gardens.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:51):**  And then they would sell the crops  from the rest of the acreage,  but they were always feeding themselves.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:47:55):**  And so somewhere between 1945 and 1975,  we forced these farmers to grow their operations  and shrink their workforce to eke out ever more profit  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:06):**  for the middlemen and distributors and everything else,  such that these farmers didn't have time or energy left  to grow their own food in their backyards.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:15):**  It was only a couple of the farms  that were starting to make the transition back to regen  that we found growing their own food  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:21):**  in any significant portion.  And that's, I think, really telling.  And I don't blame these farmers for that at all,  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:29):**  because the reality is, as a farmer,  as anybody's listening to this show, it probably is,  you guys are faced with a situation that  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:37):**  if you take inflation into consideration,  the amount of profit or cents on the dollar  that's coming back,  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:45):**  so for every consumer dollar spent on food,  I think you're now down to about 14 cents  returning to the farmer.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:52):**  For the farmer in the 1960s,  that number was around 60 cents on the dollar.  So 60 cents on the dollar  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:48:58):**  going directly back to the farmer in 1960s,  now it's 14 cents for the farmer today.  And then if you take in inflation,  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:04):**  that's actually a 96% reduction in your livelihood  or the amount of money coming from consumer back to farmer  over that period of time.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:14):**  That's why farms have had to grow so large ultimately,  is not just because these farmers wanna get rich,  they have to grow 10 times more crop  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:22):**  if they're going to make it at 14 cents on the dollar.  And so it's really the economics of all of the subsidization  and false economies of banks loaning out money for inputs,  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:34):**  and then the banks getting back an interest on all of that.  And then you've got distributors that have become  these almost monopoly-like juggernauts  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:44):**  between you and the customer.  All of this is built in an insoluble system  that has forced farmers into a state of exhaustion  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:49:50):**  that has just really rarely been seen in history, if ever.  To add to your earlier comments,  it's easy for us to forget that the agricultural landscape  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:01):**  actually looked significantly different  not that long ago in history.  Today, we have the significant majority of apple production  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:08):**  all concentrated in the state of Washington, for example,  and there's other regions of the country,  New York and Michigan contribute some as well  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:13):**  in other parts of the country.  But not so very long ago, if I recall correctly, was 1949.  Prior to 1949, the state of Iowa was the sixth  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:23):**  in the nation in apple production.  And there was large-scale flax production,  a lot of what could be considered more specialty crops.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:30):**  And today in the state of Iowa,  anything that's not corn and not soybeans  is considered a specialty crop.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:35):**  So the agricultural landscape has shifted,  as you pointed out, for a whole variety,  a whole range of different reasons and influences.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:43):**  But I want to come back,  we've talked about the challenges of glyphosate  and pesticides and the health epidemic  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:52):**  or the sickness epidemic that is occurring  in the countryside and across the country.  The obvious question that needs to be asked is,  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:50:59):**  how can people in rural areas protect themselves?  Yeah, I think it really begins in your soil  and it's such a fast recovery, I find it phenomenal.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:09):**  For all the bad news that we've shared on this podcast,  I think the silver lining here, in fact,  the bright light at the end of this tunnel of destruction  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:18):**  that we've experienced as an agricultural system  is this regenerative movement.  I'm just dumbfounded by the speed  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:25):**  at which the recovery happens, not just for the soil,  but the health and vitality of families.  And so, Don and Grant and Brightcrutes  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:34):**  that were featured in our first  farmer's footprint documentary, they are a great example  of just the vitality that they've been bringing back  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:42):**  into their environment.  Since making the transition to a regenerative system,  they've certainly grown their farm,  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:48):**  they've got a lot more acreage under farming now,  they were kind of at a financial crisis point.  Before making the transition,  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:51:55):**  farm was overrun with Roundup resistant weeds  that were shutting down equipment  and all kinds of things falling apart.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:02):**  And as they've made this steady increase  to a regenerative system,  they've just seen an explosion in their progress.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:09):**  And not only has that been good for business on the farm,  it's inspired their daughter to return to the farm  with her family and create a direct to consumer marketplace  
**[0:52:18-0:52:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:18):**  for their grass raised beef that's participating  in the regeneration of the soils of their land they run  and all of this.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:26):**  And so seeing a multi-generational farm  start to reclaim its potential there is really thrilling.  And that farm had been in the family,  
**[0:52:35-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:35):**  I believe for their, in the fourth generation,  I believe there with grants, current management.  And so to see this fourth or fifth generation  
**[0:52:43-0:52:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:43):**  coming on with their children is just phenomenally exciting  that that potential is there.  And if you go out to any commodities growing farm right now,  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:51):**  one of their primary concerns is the session plans.  There are not enough children wanting to stay  in those environments to fight out  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:52:58):**  an ever smaller margin of success  with ever more effort and more toxic lifestyle  and more lonely lifestyle that's happening  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:09):**  in these mega farm environments.  And so regenerative agriculture is so interesting  in that it solves so many levels of the crisis that we're in.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:18):**  One of the neat ones is reconnection to community.  Going to a regen conference is like going  to a massive family reunion where there's just so much joy  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:25):**  and everybody is talking about, I mean,  what they've seen fixed on their land  as mother nature's taken back over,  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:31):**  what species they're now seeing and cover crops coming up,  what species of ancient prairie grass is starting to grow  on their land again and what types of species  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:41):**  of birds are back in.  Like that's what I hear in the halls of regen agricultural.  If you go to your conventional agricultural system,  
**[0:53:50-0:53:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:53:50):**  everybody's talking about their bushels of soybeans  and how many per acre and what are their best inputs  and what's the new farm subsidy that's best to go after,  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:00):**  how much sugar beet should you plant  so you get the maximum subsidies.  It's just an opposite conversation that really speaks  
**[0:54:09-0:54:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:09):**  to not just the health of the human beings  in that environment, the health and vitality of economics,  ecology, all of it is just beautiful ripples  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:18):**  of generative, regenerative life giving  on every level kind of effects.  Zach, I want to get into the conversation more deeply  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:27):**  about agriculture and agronomy,  but I want to go back to the question that I asked you  in the context of personal human health.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:34):**  How can people in rural areas protect themselves?  How can our listeners, where can they go to learn more  on how to protect their own health  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:42):**  and how to regenerate their own bodies, microbiome,  if you will, to overcome the challenges  that are being inflicted upon them by their environment?  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:52):**  Yeah, those are great questions.  And the answers are challenging in the backyard,  but they are there.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:54:58):**  So starting to grow your own food  is your best first step, I think.  And so getting reconnected to the soil  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:04):**  and your own nutrition system is gonna be one  of the most deep assets you can possibly create  for your family.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:10):**  So if you're not currently growing a home garden,  many of our Regen farmers are realizing  that they can actually create an additional revenue stream  
**[0:55:19-0:55:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:19):**  by just expanding that home garden to a couple acres  and having a direct market garden growing there again.  And they had forgotten that they could have  
**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:28):**  revenue coming in throughout the spring and summer  while they were waiting for that big harvest check  to come in in October.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:34):**  They're now making money all season  and they're growing pumpkins in the fall  and they're doing it all right  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:40):**  as far as that diversification of income.  But at the same time, they're doubling down  on human health in the home.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:46):**  They're starting to eat real homegrown tomatoes again,  which have all these anti-cancer compounds  and they're eating real kale and Brussels sprouts,  
**[0:55:53-0:55:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:53):**  getting in those cruciferous vegetables.  They're getting sweet potatoes in there  and those root vegetables having all this interesting fiber  
**[0:55:59-0:56:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:55:59):**  with the beets and the turnips and the radishes,  just life-giving force within the food  that you're growing in that backyard.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:06):**  And so you cannot diminish or understate  the importance of that home production  of your own food system again.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:15):**  So that's step one for human health,  bring that regenerative experience into the kitchen.  Number two, if you want additional support  
**[0:56:23-0:56:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:23):**  against glyphosate and all of that  as you're making your transition and suffering  under the consequences of a food system  
**[0:56:28-0:56:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:28):**  that's saturated with the chemical,  this is a biased response now,  but this is what our company's been working on  
**[0:56:33-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:33):**  for the last eight years,  is how do we use soil redox chemistry  much as you guys use it in soil inputs.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:41):**  We've learned to produce pharmaceutical grade compounds  for human consumption and we produce those in Virginia  at our own state-of-the-art facility.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:50):**  We've really perfected the process  of pulling these small carbon communication network  molecules out of ancient humate.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:56:57):**  And so we've shown that to be very potent  at reversing the damage done by glyphosate  in human biology.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:04):**  It does it through supporting the intrinsic health  of the body and its ability to repair itself  once communication is restored.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:11):**  And so that product has been on the market  for the last seven years or so as the product Restore  recently rebranded over the last year  
**[0:57:19-0:57:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:19):**  to the product Ion Biome, which is a product line  that includes Ion gut for human consumption,  both for adults, there's a kids' product  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:26):**  that has the FDA dosing for weight-based dosing for kids.  There's also a pet product there  that's got a different mineral substrate in it  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:35):**  for supporting feline and health  and specifically to the kidney tubules  that are so damaged in cats  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:42):**  with the amount of roundup they see in their food system.  And then for health against the cancer consequences  of glyphosate in dogs and the like.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:51):**  So we have an equine product coming out as well.  So there's lots to be seen there and it's fascinating.  And we've shown again and again in the lab  
**[0:57:59-0:58:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:57:59):**  and in human clinical trials, the impact.  We're now in very large scale clinical trials  with a pharmaceutical product for cattle  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:06):**  and poultry and swine in Canada.  That product called LumaShield will be coming out in 2021,  having a big effect on feed efficiency and mortality  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:16):**  in those complex feed systems and protein industry.  So there's lots that we do in that space  and resources that you can look into there.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:25):**  It's really fascinating to see  that the microbial communication network of soil,  both in the ground and in your gut  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:32):**  is responsible for your reservoir  of healing potential in your body.  And it's exciting to give that back.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:39):**  It's a simple liquid that you take a few times a day  with meals to bolster up and strengthen your response  to a food system that's full of a lot  
**[0:58:48-0:58:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:48):**  of unfortunate components there.  Thanks for developing and sharing that.  I want to also focus in on the food conversation.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:58:56):**  There's this recurring theme  in the regenerative agriculture space.  And something that I'm particularly passionate about  
**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:02):**  is the idea that we have the capacity  to grow food as medicine.  So I'd like to ask you from your perspective as a doctor,  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:09):**  what does food need to be to be medicinal?  Yeah, that's a great question.  So there's a macronutrient answer to that.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:17):**  And that's fiber.  So fiber is a critical, critical piece for medicine.  The fiber acts as the coral reef, if you will,  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:25):**  to the ecology of the human gut.  And so fiber rich foods are critical  to building that healthy ecosystem within the gut  
**[0:59:33-0:59:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:33):**  and with the extended organ system within the body  to support bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and the like  in that complex ecosystem that can generate fuel  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:42):**  at every source.  They can detox the system as needed, all of that life.  So fiber, I think, is a very overlooked macronutrient  
**[0:59:51-0:59:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:51):**  that's critical to human health  as a medicinal kind of quality to it.  Then after that, you get into small molecules.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=0:59:58):**  The alkaloids get most of the attention here,  but there's certainly many other flavonoids  and other small molecules made within the plant systems  
**[1:00:08-1:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:08):**  that have profound impact on human physiology,  human biology, detoxification, all of that.  And so the alkaloids, it turns out, are made through  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:17):**  the shikimate pathway largely as well.  And so you end up disrupting that with glyphosate.  And so by going to regenerative organic process,  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:25):**  you start to give back the alkaloids  back into the food system by increasing the amount  of rich root vegetable intake.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:32):**  You're talking about things like, again, your daikon radish,  your red radish, black radish, turnips, beets,  potatoes, carrots, and the like.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:41):**  All of those are gonna have a rich assay, if you will,  of micronutrients coming out of that shikimate pathway  with the alkaloid medicinals.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:49):**  And then when you go above soil,  you get into the whole nother class of alkaloids  that are present in our cruciferous vegetables,  
**[1:00:54-1:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:00:54):**  like Brussels sprouts, kale, and the like.  Finally, as you go into the fruits,  you see some profound compounds in there.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:01):**  Lycopene is a good example of one in tomatoes, for example.  It has huge anti-cancer effects.  The lycopene content of a tomato that's grown  
**[1:01:10-1:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:10):**  in a hydroponic system and looks all red and pretty  and an insect has never touched it,  actually has almost undetectable levels  
**[1:01:17-1:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:17):**  of that lycopene cancer killer.  And so we really need to not just grow food  that looks pretty, we need to grow food that is nutrient  
**[1:01:26-1:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:26):**  and medicine dense again, if we're gonna expect to see  a reversal of this extinction event unfold.  You didn't mention the biology that is associated  
**[1:01:35-1:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:35):**  with these various plants.  Are those important for food to be medicinal as well  to our own microbiome?  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:42):**  The biology in which the plants are grown?  The biology that is contained within  and on the surfaces of those plants.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:49):**  Ah, yes, yeah, that's a really cool concept.  Yeah, so the microbiome, the bacteria,  the fungi associated with the plants themselves  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:01:57):**  seem to have an important relationship  to your gut experience.  And so I'm fascinated by the tomato  
**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:03):**  as a good example of this.  Again, the tomato has these tiny hair-like particles  that are over the surface.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:09):**  Many of you have picked a tomato before  and remember what that feels like,  that slight amount of just fuzziness that the tomato has.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:17):**  But as soon as you pick it,  and by the time you carry it into the house,  it's now kind of starting to feel like that smooth potato  
**[1:02:22-1:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:22):**  and the moment you rinse it, all of that is gone.  Well, with that incredibly diverse hair-like follicles  that cover the entire fruit,  
**[1:02:31-1:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:31):**  you've got this diverse micro ecosystem of bacteria,  fungi, and the like.  And if we look for a moment out into nature  
**[1:02:37-1:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:37):**  to learn something about that,  we find out that all of the animals that graze  are always going to be eating fruits and berries  
**[1:02:46-1:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:46):**  and the like off the plant and vegetables and the like.  Well, they're not gonna go eat the ones  that have fallen off the plant already.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:02:52):**  Typically, you're only gonna see animals grazing on food  that's out there in the living state,  in the unpicked state.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:00):**  And I've taught a lot of my patients  how to go back to that process.  So remember to at least take a bite of food every day  
**[1:03:06-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:06):**  that hasn't been picked,  that is on the living plant,  has the microbiome intact  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:11):**  to increase your gut microbiome intelligence  as you engage with it.  And so I'm always intrigued by the experience  
**[1:03:18-1:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:18):**  of biting into that tomato on the vine.  I invite you all to try this  because it's a different experience than picking that  
**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:24):**  and eating it a moment later.  To feel that hair-like quality to the tomato,  that tiny little microscopic fuzz touch the tongue,  
**[1:03:33-1:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:33):**  you will get a tingle out of that.  You'll get an experience out of just that  because that is a piece of the tomato  
**[1:03:38-1:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:38):**  that you've been missing in your diet  since the beginning of agriculture really.  So thinking about how do I get as close to the plant  
**[1:03:45-1:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:45):**  as possible is a very interesting new concept for nutrition.  Zach, there are many questions that I'd love to ask you.  We're only partially through the list  
**[1:03:52-1:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:52):**  that I put together,  and I know we're running out of time.  But there is one more question  
**[1:03:57-1:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:03:57):**  that I think is very important for us to talk about  and I'd love to get your perspective on.  You described how glyphosate  
**[1:04:04-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:04):**  and many of the associated compounds  challenge the gut microbiome and challenge the gut lining  and how that is connected to suicide tendencies,  
**[1:04:16-1:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:16):**  suicidal tendencies and depression and so forth.  And to me, this is a fascinating conversation  because of the studying that I have already done  
**[1:04:23-1:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:23):**  about the various neurotransmitters  and neural networks in our bodies.  When you consider the neural network of the gut  
**[1:04:30-1:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:30):**  and the heart and the brain  and how those are all connected by these neurotransmitters,  one of the pieces that this ties together  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:38):**  is an observation where we've observed  that many very good growers who are very in tune  with what is happening on their operation  
**[1:04:48-1:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:48):**  actively seek to develop their intuition.  And they are very good at walking into a field  and saying something is going on.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:04:59):**  I'm not sure what's going on,  but something is off with this block  or something is off with this animal.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:05):**  They can't describe it intellectually.  There may not be anything observable  that they can point to visually,  
**[1:05:12-1:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:12):**  but they have this intuitive gut instinct  of something not being well.  So the question that I have for you  
**[1:05:20-1:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:20):**  is when we consider all of these different connections,  what does it mean to be fully connected,  fully human and fully spiritually present as a farmer?  
**[1:05:31-1:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:31):**  It's the most beautiful place that we could end.  I just love the question.  I love the deep insights and experience  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:38):**  that would lead to a question like that.  A beautiful thing that I think,  as you were speaking there,  
**[1:05:44-1:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:44):**  hearkened to one of my big heroes in the field,  which is Charles Massey in Australia there.  And I think his recent book,  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:05:52):**  The Call of the Reed Warbler,  is a book of poetry as much as it is a document  of regenerative force and capacity of a farm.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:01):**  And I think he captures in that first couple  of paragraphs, pages of the book,  that transition for him where he went  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:09):**  from an exhausted, commodities crop kind of producer  and had lost all sense of spiritual connection to his land  to this incredible reawakening of that connection  
**[1:06:21-1:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:21):**  and a reawakening of the sense of beauty and love  for his land.  And I feel like that is just a real testimony, I think,  
**[1:06:29-1:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:29):**  to what we're being called here to this planet  to do as human beings,  which is to be in a co-creative process  
**[1:06:36-1:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:36):**  with Mother Nature herself.  It's almost terrifying that we forgot  we were here to create.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:43):**  We have come here as such a consumptive  and destructive Western civilization that we forgot,  that we are really called to receive from Mother Earth  
**[1:06:54-1:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:06:54):**  rather than to take from her.  And she wants to give bountifully to all of her children,  this sense of just a real joy for watching new species  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:04):**  or ancient species of birds returning to your land  when you start to allow crop diversification  and cover crops to come back in and wild flowers to grow  
**[1:07:13-1:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:13):**  on the edges of your farm again and the likes.  It's just a real reminder to us  that we're here to be recipients and co-creators  
**[1:07:22-1:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:22):**  for a healthier and more beautiful future.  I think it's interesting that humans showed up.  We showed up 200,000 years ago,  
**[1:07:29-1:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:29):**  if the fossil record's accurate.  And so 200,000 years in a planet  that's four and a half billion years old.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:36):**  And so imagine the beauty that existed so far  before our experience here.  Imagine the beauty that preceded the last great extinction  
**[1:07:43-1:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:43):**  of the dinosaurs and all of that.  There were ferns that were the size of houses.  There was just vibrant nutrient-dense forests  
**[1:07:52-1:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:07:52):**  and everything else that allowed life to thrive  as it did at that time.  We've never seen the return of reptiles at that scale  
**[1:08:00-1:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:00):**  because we don't have nutrient density  to allow for that scale of life to return yet.  And so in our human experience,  
**[1:08:07-1:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:07):**  we don't even know how beautiful this planet could get.  But I think you get it in moments of sense  of the sun rising and the mist rising  
**[1:08:14-1:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:14):**  from Charles' farm there.  And you've got the birds singing  and the pond system starting to do the hydraulic cycle again  
**[1:08:24-1:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:24):**  and you've got just this multi-tiered beauty  to the whole system.  I see that very thing in those farm events  
**[1:08:31-1:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:31):**  that are regenerative in their purpose,  where you see people in tears often hugging  and so glad to see each other  
**[1:08:38-1:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:38):**  and telling beautiful stories of what's happening  because they're feeling not just an improvement  in economic security,  
**[1:08:45-1:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:45):**  they're feeling an improvement in self-identity.  They have a deep-rooted sense of this is who I am  as a farmer, I am here to co-create and be witness  
**[1:08:54-1:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:08:54):**  to Mother Nature doing her very best  rather than constantly fighting Mother Nature  in all that she does.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:00):**  And so it's just a real deep question that you ask there  and I'm sure that you are closer to the experience of that  than I can be.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:08):**  And I can only imagine what a joy your journey has been  in this last 15 years from your,  I think it was around 2006 that you made your big switch  
**[1:09:17-1:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:17):**  and opened your eyes to this whole new world  and what a journey you've been on.  And so I would love to just hear for a moment  
**[1:09:24-1:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:24):**  what that spiritual awakening has been for you  and how that's affected not just you,  but probably your family and generations to come  
**[1:09:32-1:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:32):**  that are learning from you.  Well, I would echo your comments that ultimately,  I believe what we as humans, what we as people really desire  
**[1:09:43-1:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:43):**  is we desire connection, we desire to see and to be seen  and to be accepted.  And I think, of course, growing up in an Amish community  
**[1:09:55-1:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:09:55):**  from a very much from a Judeo-Christian worldview  perspective, I've very much come to appreciate  the different parts of the scripture  
**[1:10:05-1:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:05):**  that talk about co-creation.  And ultimately, if we believe that,  if we truly believe that we are the sons and daughters  
**[1:10:13-1:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:13):**  of God, then the extension of that,  I believe that creation is not something that happened  just at one moment in time in the beginning,  
**[1:10:23-1:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:23):**  but it's something that happens new every day.  Every day is a new creation, each moment is a new creation.  And as the sons and daughters of God, as co-creators,  
**[1:10:33-1:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:33):**  it is our gift, our opportunity and our responsibility  to co-create the reality that we desire to see here on Earth.  And when I say co-create, I'm speaking of co-creation  
**[1:10:46-1:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:46):**  with God, but also co-creation with all the other  living organisms, the plants, the animals and everything  that we are surrounded with that he has put here  
**[1:10:56-1:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:10:56):**  on this Earth for us.  We can co-create even on Earth with the knowledge  and the wisdom that we already have that he has given us.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:05):**  We simply need to stop abusing the system.  Yeah, that's beautifully said, that is beautifully said.  In the end, as a physician and as somebody  
**[1:11:16-1:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:16):**  that's increasingly around farmers,  I find that life is so eloquent in its simplicity  in the end, which is life on Earth is always marching  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:25):**  towards more biodiversity and more cooperative creation.  And so what you just described there is really the nature  of life itself, it always wants more diversity  
**[1:11:36-1:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:36):**  and it always wants more abundance from that diversity  cooperative relationship and efforts.  And I'm so excited for the potential that successful  
**[1:11:47-1:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:47):**  transition to a global regenerative agricultural system  would then lay the foundation for a regenerative economy,  for regenerative transportation and energy sector,  
**[1:11:57-1:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:11:57):**  for regenerative socioeconomic and political system.  We should realize that whether it be spiritual diversity  or religious diversity views or political diversity,  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:10):**  it's gonna give life when we embrace the diversity  for it rather than fight against those that we see  different from ourselves.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:17):**  And so in the same way that we have turned our warlike  mentality against Mother Earth and her microbes,  we are turning our warlike mentality against one another  
**[1:12:28-1:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:28):**  and we need to see the end of that if we frankly deserve  to survive past this pending extinction crisis  that we're in.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:37):**  If we're going to survive, we need a new relationship  that loses that warlike mentality.  Ultimately, there is no me and you, there is just me  
**[1:12:47-1:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:47):**  and another aspect of me.  When we truly consider and embrace the idea that all of us  are connected and all of us are one, then that gives us  
**[1:12:58-1:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:12:58):**  a whole new respect and appreciation for everything  that is creation.  That's beautiful.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:04):**  Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons I love hanging out  with you, John, is because in that sense of singularity,  in that sense of we are one, I get so tired of listening  
**[1:13:17-1:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:17):**  to my own voice, I get so tired of hearing myself  and then when I hear you say things, I'm like,  I think I might have said that recently, but it sure sounds  
**[1:13:25-1:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:25):**  better coming out of your head.  And so I'm just so relieved to have that sense of like,  consciousness is something that we're all tapping into now  
**[1:13:34-1:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:34):**  and we always have and I think we are being called  or given the opportunity to tap into this awareness of life,  this awareness of biology and experience this singularity  
**[1:13:45-1:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:45):**  of knowledge and wisdom and intuition as you so wisely  described it earlier.  Farmers have always been among our best observers  
**[1:13:53-1:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:13:53):**  and we stole that away from them.  And I think physicians, I've got the blessing of having  a bunch of the journals from my great, great, three greats,  
**[1:14:02-1:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:02):**  great, great, great grandfather who was a physician  in the 1800s and he kept these exquisite medical journals  and I see in them the same observational power  
**[1:14:12-1:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:12):**  that made him a great physician.  When there was an era of no CT scans and no X-rays  and no antibiotics, he was able to diagnose things  
**[1:14:21-1:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:21):**  that we still struggle to diagnose today  and he knew them by name.  He knew exactly what the pathogens were,  
**[1:14:28-1:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:28):**  he knew what elements needed to bring that back  in balance from a herbal concoction,  like just an extraordinary depth of wisdom and intuition  
**[1:14:36-1:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:36):**  in that human being and he trusted his own diagnostic skills  that were guided by his own deep sense of intuition  that mimic those that you just described with a farmer  
**[1:14:46-1:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:46):**  that walked into the field and says,  so hold on, something's not right,  let me listen carefully here.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:51):**  And John, I'm so looking forward to working  with your whole group in more depth  and more projects together.  
**[1:14:57-1:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:14:57):**  It's just a very exciting time when we see physicians,  scientists, economists, and farmers all coming together  to envision this new world  
**[1:15:07-1:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:07):**  that desperately needs to be built  and so I can't wait to be co-grading that  with your whole team.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:11):**  I want to thank you for sharing your wisdom, your thoughts,  and I'm sure we're going to have many enjoyable  and in-depth conversations coming up.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:22):**  The team at AEA and I are dedicated  to bringing this show to you because we believe  that knowledge and information is the foundation  
**[1:15:29-1:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:29):**  of successful regenerative systems.  At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food  and making more money from your crops is possible.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:38):**  And since 2006, we've worked  with leading professional growers to help them do just that.  At AEA, we don't guess, we test, we analyze,  
**[1:15:47-1:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:47):**  and we provide recommendations based on scientific data,  knowledge, and experience.  We've developed products that are uniquely positioned  
**[1:15:54-1:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:15:54):**  to help growers make more money with regenerative agriculture.  If you are a professional grower who believes in testing  instead of guessing, someone who believes in a better,  
**[1:16:04-1:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:16:04):**  more regenerative way to grow, visit advancingecoag.com  and contact us to see if AEA is right for you.  Thank you for listening,  
**[1:16:13-1:16:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/embracing-the-connection-between-agriculture-and-health-with-zach-bush/#t=1:16:13):**  and we look forward to working with you.

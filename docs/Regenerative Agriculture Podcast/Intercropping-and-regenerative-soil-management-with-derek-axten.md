### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2019-20-16)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  I found that advancing eco-agriculture  in 2006 to bring this knowledge together  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:33):**  in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it  into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:43):**  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which all other  growing systems are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:53):**  and make it available to everyone.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  or topics that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media or email me,  john at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:07):**  Be sure to sign up for our email list  at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.  Hope you enjoy and thank you for listening.  Hi friends, welcome back  to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:18):**  This is John Kemp once more,  and I'm very pleased to be able to have a conversation  with Derek Axton from Canada today.  This is going to be a bit of a different conversation  than you may have heard in the past.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:31):**  And the distinct difference for me at least  is that Derek and I haven't known each other  for a long time.  But I've certainly interviewed other people  that I haven't known for a long time as well,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:41):**  but I may have read a lot of their work  and been familiar with their work.  And for Derek, that's not so much the case.  So this is very much new territory for me.  We're going to have a fun conversation.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:53):**  I know that Derek has a lot to contribute  and his name has certainly come up as a grower  that many would be wise to emulate.  So Derek, thank you very much for joining us today.  And I've been looking forward to this conversation.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:05):**  We're going to have a good time.  Yeah, thanks.  Can you tell us a little bit about your journey,  your pathway, what has been the pathway that brought you  to the work that you're doing today in your farm  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:15):**  and where have you come from?  Yeah, to start with, thanks John for having me  and this will be a good conversation to have.  So to start from the beginning, I guess it's the same story  I pretty much tell everyone that, you know, for us  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:29):**  it was a chance trip to Dakota Lakes Research Farm in 2007.  And the one of the very first things  that Dr. Back took me out and showed me was an irrigator,  you know, obviously irrigating.  And he asked the group of us that were there, you know,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:44):**  how much rain we thought was entering the soil, you know,  in the form of irrigation.  And we all guessed, you know, kind of a half an inch  because there was no visible runoff.  We were right beside the irrigator.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:54):**  And he tells us that it's two inches in nine minutes.  And for me, you know, back then that was an impossibility.  In our area where we farm now,  we would have got a two inch downpour, you know,  obviously in nine minutes, the bulk of it's gonna run away.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:08):**  And we know we live in an arid environment.  We're sort of a 12 to 14 inch annual precipitation zone.  And the most limiting factor on our farm,  we feel is moisture.  So that was very powerful to witness that.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:21):**  So point forward-  Two inches in nine minutes.  Two inches in nine minutes.  Yeah, that got my attention.  And we got off the golf cart  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:27):**  and walked in behind the irrigator.  It had just passed and we could walk in our sneakers  and you didn't get mud on your shoes.  So, wow.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:38):**  So it was pretty much just tell me what to do  because I need this in my life.  Because like I said, you know,  moisture is number one for us.  Now I've learned there's so much room for improvement.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:48):**  So he talked to us about diversity and crop rotation.  Things that, you know, we grew three crops at the time.  We thought we were diverse.  Basically two crops is an alternation, not a rotation.  And we were growing three,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:00):**  but we didn't ever think about warm and cool season crops  and how to build rotation to improve soil structure  and do all these things that we wanna do  to make the water enter the soil.  Talked about earthworm channels and soil structure.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:14):**  And it's the first time in my life  I ever saw someone put a shovel in the soil  and show us aggregates.  You know, that was the words that we didn't talk about.  So I'm a slow learner.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:24):**  So it took me quite a few trips back there.  And along the way,  one time I wound up in a chance meeting with Gabe Brown.  And he invited us to his farm  on the way back from Dakota Lake.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:35):**  And same thing.  It was, you know, the shovel in the soil  and talked about rotation  and what we can do with live roots  and the power of live roots to build structure.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:43):**  Cause, you know, Gabe is similar to us.  I think they're in an 18 inch rainfall zone.  So I guess for me, it was easier to relate.  He's only about five hours from my farm.  As far as weather patterns and growing conditions  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:54):**  and those sorts of things,  it's fairly close to what we can see some years.  And we were in one of his packs  and he put his shovel in the soil  and it was the most beautiful black, crumbly,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:04):**  wonderful chocolate cake, whatever you like to call it, soil.  And we walked across the grid road  and put a shovel in his neighbor's soil.  And I'm sure he's got the most famous neighbor.  And looked at, and it was minted.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:16):**  Like it was exactly like what we had at home.  So the difference between the poor soil  and the wonderful soil was management.  Right? So that for us was, well, we can do this.  This is, and this was done in a matter of,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:32):**  you know, 10 or 12 years.  So like, we need to do this.  We need to make changes.  We need to make drastic changes, you know?  And when you talk with Gabe,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:39):**  he doesn't talk about inputs or, right?  We talk about growing things.  That's how the conversation goes.  So we don't have livestock.  So it was a bit of a challenge, you know,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:48):**  to come home and figure out how to input this diversity  into our farm.  And the simplest thing was we discovered intercropping  and that's where it started.  2011, we started growing our first intercrops,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:00):**  which are two different crops growing together  at the same time.  I guess two or more.  We do two for the most part.  And we seed them together and we harvest them together.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:11):**  I know there's a bunch of all, you know,  different variations, but that's kind of what works  in our short growing season.  Started in 2011.  By 2015, all of our broadleaf acres,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:21):**  which is approximately half of our farm,  was all intercropped.  So we started with some simple ones like canola pea,  which is pretty common,  but we soon realized that I didn't want to have canola seed  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:30):**  on my farm.  So we transitioned into mustard,  which is a higher value, lower yielding crop.  And we use that with the peas.  And we grow mostly specialty peas, you know, winter peas,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:41):**  forage peas, those sorts of things  that go into the cover crop market or into sprouting.  And those peas generally are kind of a jerk to harvest.  They want to lay down,  but when you put them with a brassica, they'll trellis,  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:52):**  and it just works really, really well.  So we did that.  Flax and chickpeas is another big one for us.  Chickpeas growing monocrop can be a bit of a disease problem.  And we learned through a research farm  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:08):**  at Red vs. Saskatchewan,  and through another friend, Colin Rosengren,  that had been doing this previous to me.  And like I said earlier,  I guess that our farm was sort of just a big group  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:19):**  of stolen ideas from other farms.  And the flax chickpea definitely wasn't ours,  but we soon seen the benefit  and we adopted it straight away.  And it completely changed chickpea production for us.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:30):**  We went from being a four fungicide pass crop to none  with better quality outcome.  Wow, that is impressive.  That was a pretty big change for us.  We had actually quit growing chickpeas  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:43):**  because I had made a decision,  we don't use insecticides, we don't use seed treatments,  we don't use fungicides, unless we're gonna lose a crop.  I mean, the fungicide, I'm not gonna die on that hill,  but that is never in the plan.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:57):**  And chickpeas, when you grow chickpeas here,  it's just, it's in the plan.  But in the intercrop situation,  nine years out of 10, we can get away with no fungicides,  and then obviously better quality seeds.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:09):**  So that was huge.  And we've tried other combinations,  but those are kind of the ones we've fallen on.  Flax with lentils is another one.  I guess we grow on a fairly large percentage of the farm.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:20):**  So there's the benefits to harvestability,  the lack of disease,  all these things work really well with the intercrops.  But the other neat thing is,  I'm sure you're aware of when,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:29):**  you know, a straight legume crop,  the problem with your carbonation ratio after harvest,  the residue just disappears, it just melts.  What we've found with changing  the carbon nitrogen ratio mix of the residue after harvest,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:41):**  we get a lot longer, more robust residue cover  that helps us through the winter  and then into next year's spring.  So we can actually keep our soils covered  with some form of armor.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:52):**  Because sometimes we just don't have enough time  in the fall to get a fall seeded cover.  That's probably our biggest challenge yet.  And the intercrops have really, really changed that for us.  Other neat things about intercrops for me was,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:05):**  when we started, we just made the conscious decision  to not use synthetic fertility.  That was sort of our,  for lack of a better term, gateway drug,  to not using synthetic.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:14):**  And we just didn't use it,  and we didn't see a difference from our previous yields.  And then by 15, so half the farm was not using synthetics,  and that just gave us the confidence to keep backing away.  Wow, so you just continued using fertilizers  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:30):**  and you did not see any yield loss from that  once you started doing the intercropping.  Yeah, so it's interesting.  And when we talk about intercrops,  we talk about this land equivalency ratio.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:40):**  So it's like, imagine you have two 50-acre fields  and you plant one to canola and one to peas.  And you harvest them separately,  and that would be a one as far as your net profit.  And if we planted both 50-acre fields and harvested them,  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:56):**  generally it's quite a bit higher.  Like our farm is about a 1.25.  I know farms that are 1.35,  and I know there's a research farm  that's seen upwards of 1.85.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:07):**  Wow, that is so amazing.  Yeah, and with that comes other benefits  like the residue, the harvestability.  There's a lot of things that come with that  that you don't see maybe in your balance sheet.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:21):**  So yeah, intercrops have been a big part of it.  We were doing these things,  and Tanis, my wife, had taken Elanie Hamm's  Life in the Soils classes,  and we got very interested in biology, soil biology,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:34):**  because you go to different presentations  and you hear people talk,  say the word biology or soil biology or soil health,  and they know we talk about it like it's air.  Really, you can.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:42):**  And the fact that we were able to learn  how to identify basically good and bad  and things that we want to see  and things that maybe we don't want to see  and how it's possible to manage those things  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:54):**  was a pretty powerful tool.  And I remember the very first time Tanis made a slide  and looked at it under the microscope,  and we were fairly confident  we were doing a pretty good job.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:02):**  We had been intercropping and cover cropping,  and we'd been no-till,  and we weren't using much synthetics,  and we kind of had it figured out.  And when we first looked at that slide  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:10):**  and it was mostly bacteria,  I tell you, that was pretty disappointing.  We were expecting to see everything she had been learning  about seeing fungi and protozoa,  and there was the odd one,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:20):**  but boy, you had to look a long time.  So the next step was to make the compost windrows here.  We make about 2,000 tons a year now,  and then we select from that 2,000 tons.  Generally, it's more than one different windrow,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:35):**  and we use that to make a compost extract,  and we put that down at seeding,  sort of in a liquid mixture with our micronutrients.  That's what goes in furrow,  which, again, was a really good crutch for us.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:48):**  We learned early on that that was a nice way to transition  from the liquid starter that we had been using  to this was a fairly easy transition, low cost.  And drastic's not the right word,  but we've seen very good improvement in soil microbiology  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:03):**  since we started using that,  and I think we'll continue that for quite some time.  It's easy to do, it's low cost.  What is the total of your nutrition management  and biology management today?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:14):**  Are you applying the compost tea in furrow?  Are there any nutrients with that?  Any other types of biostimulants or inoculants?  What's the scope of the nutrition management  that you're doing?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:24):**  So, yeah, so this past year,  we had a tiny bit of molasses,  and a few biological foods, I kind of think of it,  like obviously we're putting the biology out,  and obviously they function off plant-root exudates,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:35):**  but when we put it with a seed, there are no exudates.  So we do put a little bit of molasses  in our micronutrients that we use,  that we basically kind of figured out  from looking at sap tests,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:47):**  and we did a full extraction of our soils back years ago  when we first started with this,  and that was sort of how we based it,  and we've used sap analysis since to fine-tune.  So that's how we come up with our micros,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:59):**  and we add that then to our compost extract  just before it goes to the field,  molasses and a few other odds and ends.  Nothing spectacular or shattering,  just cheap biological foods,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:10):**  and it's been seeming to work fairly well.  And based on what you're describing,  it does seem to be working fairly well.  It seems to be a bit of an understatement.  One of the questions that immediately comes to mind,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:24):**  you described the increased yields that you're seeing  just as a factor of the intercropping.  Have you noticed any improvements in quality  from all the various things that you're doing?  Yes, I guess is the short answer.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:40):**  We provide seed, obviously, for cover crop seed,  but we also do sprouting, so then again, it has to grow.  And we've had very consistently high germination  in things since we started doing this,  and I can't explain why,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:55):**  but I know in sprouting, we have to be upper 90s  for them to want to accept those.  Even the cover crop seed, most people want to see germination  in the high 90s, the higher the better, obviously.  But germination has been, we've seen an improvement for sure  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:10):**  in our grains after, and I guess that's one metric  to measure by.  And another thing we've started doing  is nutrient density testing with Dr. Jill Coperton.  And she's developed a fairly good method  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:22):**  to test nutrients of our grains.  And according to what she's seen of ours  and the comparison she's done,  I guess I shouldn't speak for her,  but there are some things that they look at.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:34):**  I know zinc is one of the things  that she looks at specifically,  and industry kind of thinks 20 is good,  25 is really good in a cereal grain.  And we've been seeing sort of upper 30s,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:43):**  lower 40s in our zincs, like as an example.  So that's been another metric we're measuring.  And I think that's something hopefully we can use  to help us market our grains  more towards the human consumption side instead of the seed.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:57):**  One of the topics I'd love to get your perspective on,  and you described at the beginning of our conversation  how impressive the soil was  at the Dakota Lakes Research Farm  with that tremendous water infiltration.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:10):**  And I'm sure you've mentioned that you've seen  some of those changes happening on your farm as well.  What do you think are the biggest  and the most significant contributing factors?  Has it been diversity of crops?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:21):**  Has it been the compost applications, combination of both?  And within all of this, what is the impact of tillage?  Okay, so I don't...  That's a tough one to answer.  This is probably opinion,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:39):**  but I think it's a combination of things.  I guess one of the practice that we've been doing  out for five seasons is controlled traffic farming.  Still not 100% convinced it's the end all,  but we've been doing it.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:49):**  I think a combination of everything contributes,  but we have been doing consistent amounts  of infiltration tests on our farm.  And when we compare soils that we've been farming this way  for since 2011 to some soils that we just took on last year,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:06):**  a farm we bought beside us,  we try to go out after a significant rainfall.  So when we have profile and then do our tests  and we'll get the first inch in say 25 to 35 seconds,  and the second inch will be nine to 10 minutes  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:22):**  on our better soils and we'll go across the road  to the same kind of parent material  and we'll see under, well, basically first inch  after 10 minutes, we just kind of quit measuring.  So there's definite differences.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:35):**  And I really wish I could put my finger  on what certain thing we do makes a difference.  But I think if I had to pick one thing at the end of the day,  I think it's live roots.  I think that's the thing we need to focus on.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:49):**  And I don't know if it matters specifically  which live roots, but just more of them,  as far as I mean growing days,  if we can have more live roots,  putting more carbon back in the soil via the exudates.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:02):**  And that's how I feel personally anyway.  When you're doing your intercropping,  are you ever doing more than two species together?  And would there be additional soil benefits  to doing additional species together?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:16):**  So we have tried three way intercrops for sure.  And we did see improvement in yield again.  And I probably wouldn't be able to comment accurately,  probably tend to think that it would be,  but at the time the way we're set up  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:30):**  this separator intercrops is three  is a very difficult procedure  where two is very simple and fast.  So we just sort of abandoned that  until we're actually building a new seed facility right now.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:41):**  And that was in our mind when we were doing this.  Cause I think I can see us going back to trying three  cause there's some definite benefits to that.  One other thing we have done is incorporate like clovers  into say a pea canola or a pea mustard.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:58):**  So that gives us say another live root  that will grow past harvest and give us the diversity,  but we don't necessarily have to harvest it.  And I kind of like to think of those companions  as a bridge for lots of things.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:13):**  Obviously they'll help with mycorrhizae  cause when you're growing a brassica,  but then the big problem with us is we have  such a shortfall we can't get a cover in good time.  There's sort of crop maturity and then crop dry down,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:26):**  harvest, seeding the cover crop, crop emergence.  Like this can be a five week process  of nothing growing in the soil  where if we have a companion like a clover  that just grows under the canopy  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:36):**  and once we remove the canopy, the light penetrates  and then the companion can take off  and provide that live roots for the soil until freeze up.  And that's been working fairly well for us.  That's been one that I got to actually do more of.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:50):**  Yeah, I know that was a practice that we used to use  in the farm that I was growing up on  our fresh market vegetables  as we would grow a lagoon underneath vine crops.  And as the fall approached,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:02):**  the vine crops died off because of frost.  They no longer stayed in the ground  and we instantly had a lagoon that would take over.  Yeah, I think it's great.  Part of me wants to transition that now  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:13):**  to some sort of a grass  and I don't actually know what grass to use,  but I got a bit of a feeling  that we have too many legumes in rotation.  You know, it was same again,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:24):**  it was a kind of a cut for nitrogen,  but we're sort of learning that nitrogen  isn't nearly as difficult as I thought it was  four or five years ago.  So I think we can start backing away  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:33):**  from some of our lagoon-based intercrops  and see what the future brings,  but especially these companions as well,  I think we needed some kind of a grass.  But things like rye grass,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:43):**  I'm just scared of them becoming a weed  so we haven't experimented with them yet.  Maybe you have some suggestions?  I don't have any immediate or obvious suggestions  because I'm not familiar enough with your environment.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:58):**  But I would like to go back to your comment about nitrogen.  I've also experienced that nitrogen is very easy.  So what has your process been with nitrogen?  Are you able to supply 100% of the crop's requirements  with crop residues and what is in the soil profile?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:13):**  So what we've done is, like I said,  we don't provide any fertility to the, you know,  the lagoon-based intercrops,  which is about half the farm acreage.  And then the other half of the farm  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:22):**  will be different cereal crops,  you know, barley oats, wheat, derm.  We grow spelt, we grow some other ancient cereals.  And what we've been doing ahead of those  is we actually spread,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:36):**  so we're still using ammonium sulfate.  I know, I'm sure everyone knows.  I spread sort of low amounts, kind of 80 to 100 pounds.  Gives us a little bit of an end kick  and a little bit of sulfur.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:48):**  And I think it's, there again,  probably a bit of a crutch  because it really isn't that much.  And in terms of units, you know, it's like 16 pounds of N.  You know, like this year, for example,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:58):**  we can grow 150 bushel oats on 16 units of N.  You know, if you did the old typical removal rate,  something's wrong, right?  It's coming from somewhere.  And that's sort of what we've been experiencing.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:12):**  And when we look at our sap results,  our ammonium levels are very high,  our nitrate levels are very low to almost non-existent.  So I'm assuming we're getting some kind of soil drive then.  I guess I wish I knew more of the specifics,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:25):**  but yeah, that's how we feel it's going.  I'm quite curious, what led you down the pathway  of considering controlled traffic?  And actually, before you answer that question,  I had a very interesting conversation earlier this summer  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:38):**  with Jerry Hatfield and Michael McNeil  when I visited with them for a weekend.  And Jerry described how when no-till was first introduced  and first advocated very strongly,  there were five rules, foundational rules,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:53):**  that were considered to be necessary for successful no-till.  And rule number one was that you remove all compaction  from the soil profile.  And rule number two was you do everything necessary  to avoid recreating compaction layers in the soil.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:13):**  Those were considered really foundational  to having successful no-till.  And it seems to me, based on observations  on a lot of farms, that the no-till movement  has collectively seems to have lost sight of that.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:32):**  And you described in our earlier conversation  how you used to be farming no-till  but not seeing results,  and now you're doing all these additional things.  So I'd be curious on your take on that.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:45):**  What is your reaction?  Well, it really lines up.  So the big turning point for me, I guess, was there's  a Nuffield scholar in Alberta by the name of Steve Larocque  who did his Nuffields on controlled traffic farming.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:02):**  And same thing, we're lucky enough,  it's sort of a seven-hour, eight-hour drive from my farm.  And I went to two of his field days.  And once again, so this would have been maybe 2011 or 12  when we were doing this.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:14):**  Sort of the same time we were really thinking  about making major changes,  realized that we need to change drastically.  We need to make major changes.  And Steve was pretty much conventional.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:23):**  Shank opener, basically high fertility, high yield,  relatively low diversity.  But it was maybe five or six years,  and his soil structure was the closest I'd ever seen  to Dakota Lakes and Gabe Brown's farm  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:40):**  as anywhere I'd ever been.  To me, that was just another way to get there.  And I'm sure after a conversation you realize,  patience may be the wrong word,  but I just want it fixed now.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:51):**  And so instead of just doing one thing  and hoping for the best,  let's just do everything we possibly can  to improve the resource, to improve the soil.  And I thought controlled traffic was a fit.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:59):**  And it's funny now that we've got into it,  how many doors it's opened,  as far as things like maybe relay seeding  and some things that we're gonna start experimenting with.  Last year we experimented with relay seeding  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:09):**  into standing cereal crops,  trying to get our covers established sooner.  And controlled traffic just opened doors to that  that we didn't even realize were there.  And when I look at farms like Dakota Lakes and Gabe's  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:20):**  and they are doing a phenomenal job,  and I look around their yard  and look at how big their equipment is,  nothing's very heavy in comparison  to the 65,000 pound tractors that we use,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:30):**  that sort of thing, and very heavy combines.  And we're out making passes at times of the year  when we really shouldn't be from a soil perspective.  So this gives us more sort of the freedom  to go harvest the crop or seed the crop,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:45):**  maybe at times that we shouldn't be,  but it allows us to travel in the fields  without doing damage, I guess,  was sort of part of my thoughts.  And I've had pretty good conversations  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:55):**  with Jody in Minnesota, Jody DeJong-Hueys,  who's done a lot of research on this.  And I'm probably paraphrasing this wrong,  but she basically told me that not much compaction happens  when it's really dry or saturated,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:08):**  like really, really wet, like almost water.  It's when soils are almost that perfect,  nice moisture for seeding or in the spring,  then when compaction can really occur badly and to depth.  So I guess from taking all those little bits  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:24):**  from a whole bunch of different sources,  it just seemed to me that if we're dead serious  about this water infiltration thing,  that's something we're just gonna have to do.  And I think it takes time to see results.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:33):**  So we're in our fifth year now,  and I think we're starting to finally see some results.  I was just prepared to ask about that.  What observations do you have now at the five-year mark?  What are you seeing?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:45):**  Well, the water infiltration for sure,  like we don't even check on trams,  there's not much sense checking there,  but those better fields, like I talked about,  sort of the 32nd inch, those are in the fields  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:55):**  that have been the longest CTF under our management  that have got the compost and had covered crops.  That's been the trend.  Even walking in our fields, and I've had that comment from,  we've had quite a few visitors come in the summer,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:07):**  and people notice that when we walk in the fields,  and I'm sure you've felt the same too,  when you get in those really healthy soils,  that the soils are soft to the foot, it seems like.  And I'm not saying that what we do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:19):**  is the only way to do things.  It's just been our observations,  and it's been a fit for us so far.  Derek, as you've been on this pathway  and experiencing different things in your own farm,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:30):**  what has been something that was unexpected?  What surprised you?  What surprised me?  A few things.  I still struggle with that, obviously,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:42):**  because I'm still spreading nitrogen,  and according to my SAPs, I have lots, but we still do it,  I guess, out of forced habit.  With the nitrogen example,  we actually have a lot of experience with SAP analysis  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:53):**  and looking at nitrogen,  and maybe you need to do an experiment  like you did at the beginning,  just don't apply it on a certain section,  just see what happens.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah, I think so.  I've actually left a couple checks already, so that's good.  But I need to do some random applicators, I think,  is what I need,  because that's one of the other beautiful things  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:09):**  that control traffic,  is it allows us to do so many studies,  because every pass, well, not that every pass is the same,  but there's definitely more consistency in what we do,  and we have these paths that we can follow,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:21):**  we can do random replicates a little bit easier.  I think that's something  that's definitely on the to-do list for 2020.  That's probably one of my big surprises,  but the fact that we can make significant change  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:36):**  to our soil quality,  I know soil health, whatever you like to call it,  but the color change,  it just makes you feel good to look in the soils  and see the color change.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:47):**  It's so hard to explain,  but we had a lady, Marla Mintz was here from the Furrow,  and did an article on this this summer,  and one of the things she really wanted to show was that.  And we found a field,  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:57):**  so there again, that we took on last year,  and versus some of our better fields,  and the color changes.  I had actually never put them side by side  on the same shovel,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:05):**  and it was drastic,  how much darker and much more porous  the soils were side by side.  I've been in one field,  and then drove to a different field and looked,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:14):**  but to put them side by side,  I thought was very powerful.  And I didn't expect that we could make that change  in that amount of time.  I guess it's sort of like watching your kids grow up.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:23):**  You don't notice them getting taller,  but if you go away for a couple of years and come back,  wow, there's been a big change here.  So that was one of my most surprising things,  is that it's actually happening.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:37):**  You made the miles and toured,  and made the changes on your farm,  and to actually see the changes happening,  I think are pretty gratifying.  Derek, I have a question for you that I enjoy asking people,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:51):**  and the way people have responded.  What is something that you believe to be true  about modern agriculture  that is different from the mainstream view?  You know, John, I knew this question was coming,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:08):**  and I still am not that prepared.  I've been thinking about it quite a lot.  What is one thing that really stands out for me?  Or you can pick five if that's easier.  Yeah, there's a lot of ways we can go with that answer,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:25):**  but one thing I guess that sticks out to me  that maybe people will relate to,  especially in times when none of us are feeling really rich  with commodity prices being down,  and, you know, ingrained prices being down,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:35):**  is that you don't have to be high input  to be profitable, highly profitable.  Then I don't think there's any correlation there at all.  It seems to me that the more we back away from synthetics,  the more profitable we become.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:47):**  And there was a point that I thought  that our system was gonna crash,  and I'm pretty sure my neighbors still do,  but it actually is getting better, not worse.  And the profitability is, I guess,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:00):**  obviously that's what we're all trying to do  at the end of the day.  But to watch the resource improve  at the same time as profitability,  that's pretty exciting.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:10):**  And then it's just gonna continue,  both of them, to get better as we move forward.  Yeah, that is a lot of fun.  That's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:18):**  Derek, what is a book or a resource  that you would suggest to other growers  who want to learn more?  What has been a very useful source of information for you?  I've read all of David Montgomery's books.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:33):**  I think they're great.  Gabe Brown's new book I really liked.  I thought it was very well written.  And just food for thought,  I found the intercropping,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:43):**  I found more so in the information for that  is sort of more, well, social circles isn't the right word,  but I mean, it's something we've discussed among peers.  And I don't know if I actually had one original idea.  I think I basically just took from here and there  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:59):**  and put together what worked on our farm.  And that's something that I learned,  I guess that I should make a point of saying  is that I came home from both Dakota Lakes  and Gabe Brown's farm and soon learned  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:08):**  that I have to adapt those practices.  You gotta think about the context of your area,  rainfall, soil types, those sorts of things.  And yeah, I couldn't grow 200 bushel corn  in Minton, surprisingly.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:21):**  So we had to change up how we were thinking  and just use the general thoughts  or the general guidelines, I guess,  and not the specifics.  And that seemed to be what made the difference.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:33):**  And that's honestly why we got into intercropping  is because I saw the power that Gabe was having  with their cover crops or diverse cover crops.  And I said, we need diversity.  That is absolute, we need diversity.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:44):**  And how's the fastest way to do that is,  well, for us, we thought was intercropping.  And that was definitely one important piece  along the way for us.  Derek, I really appreciate that comment.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:57):**  And I appreciate the example that you gave as well  of taking the principle of diversity  and shifting that principle from cover crops  to the actual crops that you're producing.  And I think this is a very important point  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:11):**  for all of our listeners.  Some of the feedback that I've received  in the podcast in the past has been that  people desire to have more practical how-to,  nuts and bolts, how do you do this step by step?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:22):**  And that's occasionally useful,  but more often, I believe, less useful  as you just described, Derek,  because we have to adapt these ideas  to each of our individual operations.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:36):**  And some ideas may be directly transferable  and many of them may not be.  I think it's very important.  Really, the better we understand the science  or perhaps a better word would be to say  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:47):**  the better that we understand the principles,  the concepts of what really needs to happen,  then we can figure out a way to adapt those concepts  and principles specifically to our operation.  Valuable point, I really appreciate you bringing that out.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:01):**  Yeah, I think one of the things I like to do  when I do go talk to crowds here and there  is try to relay my mistakes,  because there's been many,  and try to save some people from making the same mistakes.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:12):**  I guess, because I was lucky enough to sit in the seats  and have someone tell me those,  and yeah, minor changes can make big differences.  And I think, like you said,  I think understanding where you live  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:23):**  and how those are gonna fit in your operation  is very important.  Yeah, Derek, I really enjoyed this conversation.  I'm sure that our listeners will enjoy it very much as well.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:35):**  Well, thanks, John, for having me.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  Thanks. Bye.  The team at AEA and I are dedicated  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:43):**  to bringing this show to you because we believe  that knowledge and information is the foundation  of successful regenerative systems.  At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food  and making more money from your crops is possible.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:57):**  And since 2006, we've worked  with leading professional growers  to help them do just that.  At AEA, we don't guess, we test, we analyze,  and we provide recommendations based on scientific data,  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:34:10):**  knowledge, and experience.  We've developed products that are uniquely positioned  to help growers make more money  with regenerative agriculture.  If you are a professional grower who believes in testing  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:34:20):**  instead of guessing, someone who believes in a better,  more regenerative way to grow, visit advancingecoag.com  and contact us to see if AEA is right for you.  Thank you for listening,  and we look forward to working with you.

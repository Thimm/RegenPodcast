**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality

**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:28):**  I found that advancing eco-agriculture

**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:33):**  in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:36):**  into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:37):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:40):**  It's my personal mission to have these

**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:43):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:46):**  the status quo against which all other  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:48):**  growing systems are compared.

**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:15):**  Hi friends, welcome back  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:17):**  to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:18):**  This is John Kemp once more,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:20):**  and I'm very pleased to be able to have a conversation  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:22):**  with Derek Axton from Canada today.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:26):**  This is going to be a bit of a different conversation  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:29):**  than you may have heard in the past.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:31):**  And the distinct difference for me at least  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:34):**  is that Derek and I haven't known each other  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:36):**  for a long time.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:37):**  But I've certainly interviewed other people  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:39):**  that I haven't known for a long time as well,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:41):**  but I may have read a lot of their work  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:42):**  and been familiar with their work.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:45):**  And for Derek, that's not so much the case.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:47):**  So this is very much new territory for me.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:51):**  We're going to have a fun conversation.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:53):**  I know that Derek has a lot to contribute  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:55):**  and his name has certainly come up as a grower  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:58):**  that many would be wise to emulate.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:01):**  So Derek, thank you very much for joining us today.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:03):**  And I've been looking forward to this conversation.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:05):**  We're going to have a good time.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:07):**  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:07):**  Can you tell us a little bit about your journey,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:09):**  your pathway, what has been the pathway that brought you  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:13):**  to the work that you're doing today in your farm  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:15):**  and where have you come from?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:17):**  Yeah, to start with, thanks John for having me  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:19):**  and this will be a good conversation to have.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:22):**  So to start from the beginning, I guess it's the same story  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:27):**  I pretty much tell everyone that, you know, for us  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:29):**  it was a chance trip to Dakota Lakes Research Farm in 2007.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:35):**  And the one of the very first things  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:36):**  that Dr. Back took me out and showed me was an irrigator,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:40):**  you know, obviously irrigating.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:41):**  And he asked the group of us that were there, you know,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:44):**  how much rain we thought was entering the soil, you know,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:47):**  in the form of irrigation.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:48):**  And we all guessed, you know, kind of a half an inch  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:50):**  because there was no visible runoff.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:51):**  We were right beside the irrigator.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:54):**  And he tells us that it's two inches in nine minutes.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:57):**  And for me, you know, back then that was an impossibility.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:02):**  In our area where we farm now,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:04):**  we would have got a two inch downpour, you know,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:06):**  obviously in nine minutes, the bulk of it's gonna run away.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:08):**  And we know we live in an arid environment.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:10):**  We're sort of a 12 to 14 inch annual precipitation zone.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:13):**  And the most limiting factor on our farm,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:16):**  we feel is moisture.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:18):**  So that was very powerful to witness that.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:21):**  So point forward-  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:21):**  Two inches in nine minutes.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:23):**  Two inches in nine minutes.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:24):**  Yeah, that got my attention.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:25):**  And we got off the golf cart  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:27):**  and walked in behind the irrigator.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:28):**  It had just passed and we could walk in our sneakers  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:32):**  and you didn't get mud on your shoes.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:35):**  So, wow.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:38):**  So it was pretty much just tell me what to do  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:40):**  because I need this in my life.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:42):**  Because like I said, you know,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:43):**  moisture is number one for us.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:45):**  Now I've learned there's so much room for improvement.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:48):**  So he talked to us about diversity and crop rotation.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:52):**  Things that, you know, we grew three crops at the time.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:54):**  We thought we were diverse.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:55):**  Basically two crops is an alternation, not a rotation.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:59):**  And we were growing three,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:00):**  but we didn't ever think about warm and cool season crops  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:03):**  and how to build rotation to improve soil structure  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:06):**  and do all these things that we wanna do  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:09):**  to make the water enter the soil.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:11):**  Talked about earthworm channels and soil structure.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:14):**  And it's the first time in my life  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:15):**  I ever saw someone put a shovel in the soil  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:18):**  and show us aggregates.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:19):**  You know, that was the words that we didn't talk about.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:22):**  So I'm a slow learner.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:24):**  So it took me quite a few trips back there.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:26):**  And along the way,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:27):**  one time I wound up in a chance meeting with Gabe Brown.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:30):**  And he invited us to his farm  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:33):**  on the way back from Dakota Lake.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:35):**  And same thing.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:36):**  It was, you know, the shovel in the soil  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:38):**  and talked about rotation  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:39):**  and what we can do with live roots  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:41):**  and the power of live roots to build structure.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:43):**  Cause, you know, Gabe is similar to us.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:45):**  I think they're in an 18 inch rainfall zone.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:47):**  So I guess for me, it was easier to relate.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:49):**  He's only about five hours from my farm.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:52):**  As far as weather patterns and growing conditions  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:54):**  and those sorts of things,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:55):**  it's fairly close to what we can see some years.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:58):**  And we were in one of his packs  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:00):**  and he put his shovel in the soil  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:02):**  and it was the most beautiful black, crumbly,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:04):**  wonderful chocolate cake, whatever you like to call it, soil.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:07):**  And we walked across the grid road  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:09):**  and put a shovel in his neighbor's soil.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:11):**  And I'm sure he's got the most famous neighbor.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:13):**  And looked at, and it was minted.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:16):**  Like it was exactly like what we had at home.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:21):**  So the difference between the poor soil  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:23):**  and the wonderful soil was management.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:27):**  Right? So that for us was, well, we can do this.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:30):**  This is, and this was done in a matter of,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:32):**  you know, 10 or 12 years.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:33):**  So like, we need to do this.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:35):**  We need to make changes.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:36):**  We need to make drastic changes, you know?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:38):**  And when you talk with Gabe,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:39):**  he doesn't talk about inputs or, right?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:41):**  We talk about growing things.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:42):**  That's how the conversation goes.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:44):**  So we don't have livestock.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:46):**  So it was a bit of a challenge, you know,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:48):**  to come home and figure out how to input this diversity  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:52):**  into our farm.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:53):**  And the simplest thing was we discovered intercropping  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:56):**  and that's where it started.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:57):**  2011, we started growing our first intercrops,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:00):**  which are two different crops growing together  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:03):**  at the same time.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:04):**  I guess two or more.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:05):**  We do two for the most part.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:07):**  And we seed them together and we harvest them together.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:11):**  I know there's a bunch of all, you know,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:12):**  different variations, but that's kind of what works  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:14):**  in our short growing season.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:17):**  Started in 2011.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:19):**  By 2015, all of our broadleaf acres,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:21):**  which is approximately half of our farm,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:23):**  was all intercropped.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:24):**  So we started with some simple ones like canola pea,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:26):**  which is pretty common,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:28):**  but we soon realized that I didn't want to have canola seed  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:30):**  on my farm.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:31):**  So we transitioned into mustard,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:33):**  which is a higher value, lower yielding crop.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:36):**  And we use that with the peas.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:38):**  And we grow mostly specialty peas, you know, winter peas,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:41):**  forage peas, those sorts of things  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:42):**  that go into the cover crop market or into sprouting.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:45):**  And those peas generally are kind of a jerk to harvest.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:48):**  They want to lay down,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:49):**  but when you put them with a brassica, they'll trellis,  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:52):**  and it just works really, really well.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:55):**  So we did that.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:57):**  Flax and chickpeas is another big one for us.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:00):**  Chickpeas growing monocrop can be a bit of a disease problem.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:05):**  And we learned through a research farm  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:08):**  at Red vs. Saskatchewan,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:09):**  and through another friend, Colin Rosengren,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:12):**  that had been doing this previous to me.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:14):**  And like I said earlier,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:16):**  I guess that our farm was sort of just a big group  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:19):**  of stolen ideas from other farms.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:21):**  And the flax chickpea definitely wasn't ours,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:23):**  but we soon seen the benefit  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:24):**  and we adopted it straight away.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:27):**  And it completely changed chickpea production for us.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:30):**  We went from being a four fungicide pass crop to none  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:35):**  with better quality outcome.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:37):**  Wow, that is impressive.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:39):**  That was a pretty big change for us.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:42):**  We had actually quit growing chickpeas  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:43):**  because I had made a decision,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:44):**  we don't use insecticides, we don't use seed treatments,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:48):**  we don't use fungicides, unless we're gonna lose a crop.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:52):**  I mean, the fungicide, I'm not gonna die on that hill,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:55):**  but that is never in the plan.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:57):**  And chickpeas, when you grow chickpeas here,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:59):**  it's just, it's in the plan.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:01):**  But in the intercrop situation,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:04):**  nine years out of 10, we can get away with no fungicides,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:07):**  and then obviously better quality seeds.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:09):**  So that was huge.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:11):**  And we've tried other combinations,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:12):**  but those are kind of the ones we've fallen on.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:15):**  Flax with lentils is another one.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:17):**  I guess we grow on a fairly large percentage of the farm.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:20):**  So there's the benefits to harvestability,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:22):**  the lack of disease,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:23):**  all these things work really well with the intercrops.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:25):**  But the other neat thing is,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:27):**  I'm sure you're aware of when,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:29):**  you know, a straight legume crop,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:31):**  the problem with your carbonation ratio after harvest,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:33):**  the residue just disappears, it just melts.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:36):**  What we've found with changing  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:38):**  the carbon nitrogen ratio mix of the residue after harvest,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:41):**  we get a lot longer, more robust residue cover  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:45):**  that helps us through the winter  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:47):**  and then into next year's spring.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:49):**  So we can actually keep our soils covered  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:50):**  with some form of armor.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:52):**  Because sometimes we just don't have enough time  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:54):**  in the fall to get a fall seeded cover.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:56):**  That's probably our biggest challenge yet.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:59):**  And the intercrops have really, really changed that for us.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:03):**  Other neat things about intercrops for me was,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:05):**  when we started, we just made the conscious decision  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:07):**  to not use synthetic fertility.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:09):**  That was sort of our,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:10):**  for lack of a better term, gateway drug,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:13):**  to not using synthetic.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:14):**  And we just didn't use it,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:16):**  and we didn't see a difference from our previous yields.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:20):**  And then by 15, so half the farm was not using synthetics,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:24):**  and that just gave us the confidence to keep backing away.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:27):**  Wow, so you just continued using fertilizers  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:30):**  and you did not see any yield loss from that  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:33):**  once you started doing the intercropping.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:35):**  Yeah, so it's interesting.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:37):**  And when we talk about intercrops,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:38):**  we talk about this land equivalency ratio.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:40):**  So it's like, imagine you have two 50-acre fields  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:43):**  and you plant one to canola and one to peas.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:46):**  And you harvest them separately,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:47):**  and that would be a one as far as your net profit.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:51):**  And if we planted both 50-acre fields and harvested them,  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:56):**  generally it's quite a bit higher.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:58):**  Like our farm is about a 1.25.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:01):**  I know farms that are 1.35,  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:02):**  and I know there's a research farm  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:04):**  that's seen upwards of 1.85.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:07):**  Wow, that is so amazing.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:10):**  Yeah, and with that comes other benefits  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:12):**  like the residue, the harvestability.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:16):**  There's a lot of things that come with that  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:17):**  that you don't see maybe in your balance sheet.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:21):**  So yeah, intercrops have been a big part of it.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:25):**  We were doing these things,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:26):**  and Tanis, my wife, had taken Elanie Hamm's  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:30):**  Life in the Soils classes,  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:31):**  and we got very interested in biology, soil biology,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:34):**  because you go to different presentations  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:36):**  and you hear people talk,  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:37):**  say the word biology or soil biology or soil health,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:39):**  and they know we talk about it like it's air.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:42):**  Really, you can.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:42):**  And the fact that we were able to learn  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:45):**  how to identify basically good and bad  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:47):**  and things that we want to see  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:48):**  and things that maybe we don't want to see  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:50):**  and how it's possible to manage those things  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:54):**  was a pretty powerful tool.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:55):**  And I remember the very first time Tanis made a slide  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:57):**  and looked at it under the microscope,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:59):**  and we were fairly confident  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:01):**  we were doing a pretty good job.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:02):**  We had been intercropping and cover cropping,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:05):**  and we'd been no-till,  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:06):**  and we weren't using much synthetics,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:07):**  and we kind of had it figured out.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:09):**  And when we first looked at that slide  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:10):**  and it was mostly bacteria,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:11):**  I tell you, that was pretty disappointing.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:15):**  We were expecting to see everything she had been learning  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:17):**  about seeing fungi and protozoa,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:19):**  and there was the odd one,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:20):**  but boy, you had to look a long time.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:23):**  So the next step was to make the compost windrows here.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:28):**  We make about 2,000 tons a year now,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:30):**  and then we select from that 2,000 tons.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:33):**  Generally, it's more than one different windrow,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:35):**  and we use that to make a compost extract,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:39):**  and we put that down at seeding,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:41):**  sort of in a liquid mixture with our micronutrients.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:45):**  That's what goes in furrow,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:46):**  which, again, was a really good crutch for us.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:48):**  We learned early on that that was a nice way to transition  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:52):**  from the liquid starter that we had been using  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:54):**  to this was a fairly easy transition, low cost.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:57):**  And drastic's not the right word,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:59):**  but we've seen very good improvement in soil microbiology  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:03):**  since we started using that,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:04):**  and I think we'll continue that for quite some time.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:08):**  It's easy to do, it's low cost.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:10):**  What is the total of your nutrition management  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:13):**  and biology management today?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:14):**  Are you applying the compost tea in furrow?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:17):**  Are there any nutrients with that?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:19):**  Any other types of biostimulants or inoculants?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:21):**  What's the scope of the nutrition management  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:23):**  that you're doing?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:24):**  So, yeah, so this past year,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:26):**  we had a tiny bit of molasses,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:28):**  and a few biological foods, I kind of think of it,  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:31):**  like obviously we're putting the biology out,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:33):**  and obviously they function off plant-root exudates,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:35):**  but when we put it with a seed, there are no exudates.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:38):**  So we do put a little bit of molasses  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:41):**  in our micronutrients that we use,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:44):**  that we basically kind of figured out  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:46):**  from looking at sap tests,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:47):**  and we did a full extraction of our soils back years ago  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:51):**  when we first started with this,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:52):**  and that was sort of how we based it,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:53):**  and we've used sap analysis since to fine-tune.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:57):**  So that's how we come up with our micros,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:59):**  and we add that then to our compost extract  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:02):**  just before it goes to the field,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:04):**  molasses and a few other odds and ends.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:06):**  Nothing spectacular or shattering,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:08):**  just cheap biological foods,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:10):**  and it's been seeming to work fairly well.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:15):**  And based on what you're describing,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:18):**  it does seem to be working fairly well.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:20):**  It seems to be a bit of an understatement.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:21):**  One of the questions that immediately comes to mind,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:24):**  you described the increased yields that you're seeing  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:28):**  just as a factor of the intercropping.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:31):**  Have you noticed any improvements in quality  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:33):**  from all the various things that you're doing?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:37):**  Yes, I guess is the short answer.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:40):**  We provide seed, obviously, for cover crop seed,  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:43):**  but we also do sprouting, so then again, it has to grow.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:46):**  And we've had very consistently high germination  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:51):**  in things since we started doing this,  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:53):**  and I can't explain why,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:55):**  but I know in sprouting, we have to be upper 90s  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:58):**  for them to want to accept those.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:00):**  Even the cover crop seed, most people want to see germination  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:03):**  in the high 90s, the higher the better, obviously.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:05):**  But germination has been, we've seen an improvement for sure  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:10):**  in our grains after, and I guess that's one metric  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:13):**  to measure by.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:14):**  And another thing we've started doing  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:15):**  is nutrient density testing with Dr. Jill Coperton.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:18):**  And she's developed a fairly good method  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:22):**  to test nutrients of our grains.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:24):**  And according to what she's seen of ours  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:28):**  and the comparison she's done,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:30):**  I guess I shouldn't speak for her,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:31):**  but there are some things that they look at.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:34):**  I know zinc is one of the things  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:36):**  that she looks at specifically,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:37):**  and industry kind of thinks 20 is good,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:39):**  25 is really good in a cereal grain.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:42):**  And we've been seeing sort of upper 30s,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:43):**  lower 40s in our zincs, like as an example.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:46):**  So that's been another metric we're measuring.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:49):**  And I think that's something hopefully we can use  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:52):**  to help us market our grains  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:53):**  more towards the human consumption side instead of the seed.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:57):**  One of the topics I'd love to get your perspective on,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:59):**  and you described at the beginning of our conversation  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:02):**  how impressive the soil was  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:05):**  at the Dakota Lakes Research Farm  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:06):**  with that tremendous water infiltration.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:10):**  And I'm sure you've mentioned that you've seen  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:13):**  some of those changes happening on your farm as well.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:15):**  What do you think are the biggest  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:17):**  and the most significant contributing factors?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:19):**  Has it been diversity of crops?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:21):**  Has it been the compost applications, combination of both?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:25):**  And within all of this, what is the impact of tillage?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:31):**  Okay, so I don't...  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:36):**  That's a tough one to answer.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:37):**  This is probably opinion,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:39):**  but I think it's a combination of things.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:41):**  I guess one of the practice that we've been doing  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:42):**  out for five seasons is controlled traffic farming.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:45):**  Still not 100% convinced it's the end all,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:47):**  but we've been doing it.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:49):**  I think a combination of everything contributes,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:52):**  but we have been doing consistent amounts  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:56):**  of infiltration tests on our farm.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:58):**  And when we compare soils that we've been farming this way  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:02):**  for since 2011 to some soils that we just took on last year,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:06):**  a farm we bought beside us,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:08):**  we try to go out after a significant rainfall.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:10):**  So when we have profile and then do our tests  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:13):**  and we'll get the first inch in say 25 to 35 seconds,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:18):**  and the second inch will be nine to 10 minutes  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:22):**  on our better soils and we'll go across the road  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:26):**  to the same kind of parent material  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:28):**  and we'll see under, well, basically first inch  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:32):**  after 10 minutes, we just kind of quit measuring.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:34):**  So there's definite differences.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:35):**  And I really wish I could put my finger  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:37):**  on what certain thing we do makes a difference.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:41):**  But I think if I had to pick one thing at the end of the day,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:45):**  I think it's live roots.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:47):**  I think that's the thing we need to focus on.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:49):**  And I don't know if it matters specifically  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:51):**  which live roots, but just more of them,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:53):**  as far as I mean growing days,  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:57):**  if we can have more live roots,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:59):**  putting more carbon back in the soil via the exudates.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:02):**  And that's how I feel personally anyway.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:06):**  When you're doing your intercropping,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:09):**  are you ever doing more than two species together?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:12):**  And would there be additional soil benefits  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:14):**  to doing additional species together?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:16):**  So we have tried three way intercrops for sure.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:18):**  And we did see improvement in yield again.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:22):**  And I probably wouldn't be able to comment accurately,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:25):**  probably tend to think that it would be,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:27):**  but at the time the way we're set up  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:30):**  this separator intercrops is three  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:32):**  is a very difficult procedure  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:34):**  where two is very simple and fast.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:36):**  So we just sort of abandoned that  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:38):**  until we're actually building a new seed facility right now.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:41):**  And that was in our mind when we were doing this.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:43):**  Cause I think I can see us going back to trying three  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:46):**  cause there's some definite benefits to that.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:51):**  One other thing we have done is incorporate like clovers  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:56):**  into say a pea canola or a pea mustard.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:58):**  So that gives us say another live root  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:01):**  that will grow past harvest and give us the diversity,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:05):**  but we don't necessarily have to harvest it.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:07):**  And I kind of like to think of those companions  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:11):**  as a bridge for lots of things.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:13):**  Obviously they'll help with mycorrhizae  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:15):**  cause when you're growing a brassica,  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:17):**  but then the big problem with us is we have  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:21):**  such a shortfall we can't get a cover in good time.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:24):**  There's sort of crop maturity and then crop dry down,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:26):**  harvest, seeding the cover crop, crop emergence.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:29):**  Like this can be a five week process  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:31):**  of nothing growing in the soil  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:32):**  where if we have a companion like a clover  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:35):**  that just grows under the canopy  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:36):**  and once we remove the canopy, the light penetrates  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:38):**  and then the companion can take off  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:41):**  and provide that live roots for the soil until freeze up.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:45):**  And that's been working fairly well for us.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:47):**  That's been one that I got to actually do more of.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:50):**  Yeah, I know that was a practice that we used to use  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:53):**  in the farm that I was growing up on  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:54):**  our fresh market vegetables  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:56):**  as we would grow a lagoon underneath vine crops.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:00):**  And as the fall approached,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:02):**  the vine crops died off because of frost.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:05):**  They no longer stayed in the ground  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:06):**  and we instantly had a lagoon that would take over.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:09):**  Yeah, I think it's great.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:11):**  Part of me wants to transition that now  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:13):**  to some sort of a grass  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:15):**  and I don't actually know what grass to use,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:18):**  but I got a bit of a feeling  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:19):**  that we have too many legumes in rotation.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:23):**  You know, it was same again,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:24):**  it was a kind of a cut for nitrogen,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:26):**  but we're sort of learning that nitrogen  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:27):**  isn't nearly as difficult as I thought it was  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:30):**  four or five years ago.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:32):**  So I think we can start backing away  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:33):**  from some of our lagoon-based intercrops  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:36):**  and see what the future brings,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:37):**  but especially these companions as well,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:40):**  I think we needed some kind of a grass.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:41):**  But things like rye grass,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:43):**  I'm just scared of them becoming a weed  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:44):**  so we haven't experimented with them yet.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:48):**  Maybe you have some suggestions?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:51):**  I don't have any immediate or obvious suggestions  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:53):**  because I'm not familiar enough with your environment.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:58):**  But I would like to go back to your comment about nitrogen.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:01):**  I've also experienced that nitrogen is very easy.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:03):**  So what has your process been with nitrogen?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:05):**  Are you able to supply 100% of the crop's requirements  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:08):**  with crop residues and what is in the soil profile?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:13):**  So what we've done is, like I said,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:15):**  we don't provide any fertility to the, you know,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:17):**  the lagoon-based intercrops,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:19):**  which is about half the farm acreage.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:21):**  And then the other half of the farm  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:22):**  will be different cereal crops,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:25):**  you know, barley oats, wheat, derm.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:28):**  We grow spelt, we grow some other ancient cereals.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:32):**  And what we've been doing ahead of those  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:35):**  is we actually spread,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:36):**  so we're still using ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:37):**  I know, I'm sure everyone knows.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:40):**  I spread sort of low amounts, kind of 80 to 100 pounds.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:44):**  Gives us a little bit of an end kick  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:46):**  and a little bit of sulfur.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:48):**  And I think it's, there again,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:50):**  probably a bit of a crutch  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:51):**  because it really isn't that much.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:53):**  And in terms of units, you know, it's like 16 pounds of N.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:56):**  You know, like this year, for example,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:58):**  we can grow 150 bushel oats on 16 units of N.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:02):**  You know, if you did the old typical removal rate,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:05):**  something's wrong, right?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:07):**  It's coming from somewhere.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:10):**  And that's sort of what we've been experiencing.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:12):**  And when we look at our sap results,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:14):**  our ammonium levels are very high,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:16):**  our nitrate levels are very low to almost non-existent.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:18):**  So I'm assuming we're getting some kind of soil drive then.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:22):**  I guess I wish I knew more of the specifics,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:25):**  but yeah, that's how we feel it's going.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:28):**  I'm quite curious, what led you down the pathway  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:31):**  of considering controlled traffic?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:33):**  And actually, before you answer that question,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:36):**  I had a very interesting conversation earlier this summer  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:38):**  with Jerry Hatfield and Michael McNeil  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:41):**  when I visited with them for a weekend.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:43):**  And Jerry described how when no-till was first introduced  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:48):**  and first advocated very strongly,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:50):**  there were five rules, foundational rules,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:53):**  that were considered to be necessary for successful no-till.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:57):**  And rule number one was that you remove all compaction  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:03):**  from the soil profile.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:04):**  And rule number two was you do everything necessary  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:08):**  to avoid recreating compaction layers in the soil.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:13):**  Those were considered really foundational  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:16):**  to having successful no-till.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:18):**  And it seems to me, based on observations  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:23):**  on a lot of farms, that the no-till movement  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:28):**  has collectively seems to have lost sight of that.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:32):**  And you described in our earlier conversation  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:35):**  how you used to be farming no-till  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:38):**  but not seeing results,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:40):**  and now you're doing all these additional things.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:42):**  So I'd be curious on your take on that.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:45):**  What is your reaction?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:47):**  Well, it really lines up.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:49):**  So the big turning point for me, I guess, was there's  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:53):**  a Nuffield scholar in Alberta by the name of Steve Larocque  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:58):**  who did his Nuffields on controlled traffic farming.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:02):**  And same thing, we're lucky enough,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:04):**  it's sort of a seven-hour, eight-hour drive from my farm.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:06):**  And I went to two of his field days.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:08):**  And once again, so this would have been maybe 2011 or 12  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:12):**  when we were doing this.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:14):**  Sort of the same time we were really thinking  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:15):**  about making major changes,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:17):**  realized that we need to change drastically.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:19):**  We need to make major changes.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:20):**  And Steve was pretty much conventional.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:23):**  Shank opener, basically high fertility, high yield,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:28):**  relatively low diversity.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:31):**  But it was maybe five or six years,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:33):**  and his soil structure was the closest I'd ever seen  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:37):**  to Dakota Lakes and Gabe Brown's farm  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:40):**  as anywhere I'd ever been.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:42):**  To me, that was just another way to get there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:44):**  And I'm sure after a conversation you realize,  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:47):**  patience may be the wrong word,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:49):**  but I just want it fixed now.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:51):**  And so instead of just doing one thing  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:52):**  and hoping for the best,  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:53):**  let's just do everything we possibly can  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:56):**  to improve the resource, to improve the soil.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:57):**  And I thought controlled traffic was a fit.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:59):**  And it's funny now that we've got into it,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:01):**  how many doors it's opened,  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:03):**  as far as things like maybe relay seeding  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:05):**  and some things that we're gonna start experimenting with.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:07):**  Last year we experimented with relay seeding  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:09):**  into standing cereal crops,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:11):**  trying to get our covers established sooner.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:13):**  And controlled traffic just opened doors to that  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:16):**  that we didn't even realize were there.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:18):**  And when I look at farms like Dakota Lakes and Gabe's  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:20):**  and they are doing a phenomenal job,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:23):**  and I look around their yard  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:24):**  and look at how big their equipment is,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:26):**  nothing's very heavy in comparison  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:28):**  to the 65,000 pound tractors that we use,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:30):**  that sort of thing, and very heavy combines.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:32):**  And we're out making passes at times of the year  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:37):**  when we really shouldn't be from a soil perspective.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:39):**  So this gives us more sort of the freedom  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:42):**  to go harvest the crop or seed the crop,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:45):**  maybe at times that we shouldn't be,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:46):**  but it allows us to travel in the fields  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:48):**  without doing damage, I guess,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:50):**  was sort of part of my thoughts.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:52):**  And I've had pretty good conversations  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:55):**  with Jody in Minnesota, Jody DeJong-Hueys,  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:58):**  who's done a lot of research on this.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:59):**  And I'm probably paraphrasing this wrong,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:01):**  but she basically told me that not much compaction happens  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:04):**  when it's really dry or saturated,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:08):**  like really, really wet, like almost water.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:10):**  It's when soils are almost that perfect,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:13):**  nice moisture for seeding or in the spring,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:16):**  then when compaction can really occur badly and to depth.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:20):**  So I guess from taking all those little bits  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:24):**  from a whole bunch of different sources,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:25):**  it just seemed to me that if we're dead serious  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:27):**  about this water infiltration thing,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:29):**  that's something we're just gonna have to do.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:31):**  And I think it takes time to see results.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:33):**  So we're in our fifth year now,  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:34):**  and I think we're starting to finally see some results.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:39):**  I was just prepared to ask about that.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:41):**  What observations do you have now at the five-year mark?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:44):**  What are you seeing?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:45):**  Well, the water infiltration for sure,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:47):**  like we don't even check on trams,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:48):**  there's not much sense checking there,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:49):**  but those better fields, like I talked about,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:52):**  sort of the 32nd inch, those are in the fields  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:55):**  that have been the longest CTF under our management  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:57):**  that have got the compost and had covered crops.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:00):**  That's been the trend.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:02):**  Even walking in our fields, and I've had that comment from,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:05):**  we've had quite a few visitors come in the summer,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:07):**  and people notice that when we walk in the fields,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:09):**  and I'm sure you've felt the same too,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:10):**  when you get in those really healthy soils,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:12):**  that the soils are soft to the foot, it seems like.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:16):**  And I'm not saying that what we do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:19):**  is the only way to do things.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:20):**  It's just been our observations,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:22):**  and it's been a fit for us so far.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:25):**  Derek, as you've been on this pathway  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:27):**  and experiencing different things in your own farm,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:30):**  what has been something that was unexpected?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:34):**  What surprised you?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:37):**  What surprised me?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:38):**  A few things.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:41):**  I still struggle with that, obviously,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:42):**  because I'm still spreading nitrogen,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:43):**  and according to my SAPs, I have lots, but we still do it,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:46):**  I guess, out of forced habit.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:50):**  With the nitrogen example,  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:51):**  we actually have a lot of experience with SAP analysis  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:53):**  and looking at nitrogen,  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:55):**  and maybe you need to do an experiment  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:56):**  like you did at the beginning,  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:57):**  just don't apply it on a certain section,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:59):**  just see what happens.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:02):**  I've actually left a couple checks already, so that's good.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:05):**  But I need to do some random applicators, I think,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:07):**  is what I need,  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:08):**  because that's one of the other beautiful things  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:09):**  that control traffic,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:10):**  is it allows us to do so many studies,  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:13):**  because every pass, well, not that every pass is the same,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:15):**  but there's definitely more consistency in what we do,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:19):**  and we have these paths that we can follow,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:21):**  we can do random replicates a little bit easier.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:25):**  I think that's something  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:26):**  that's definitely on the to-do list for 2020.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:30):**  That's probably one of my big surprises,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:32):**  but the fact that we can make significant change  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:36):**  to our soil quality,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:38):**  I know soil health, whatever you like to call it,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:39):**  but the color change,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:43):**  it just makes you feel good to look in the soils  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:46):**  and see the color change.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:47):**  It's so hard to explain,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:48):**  but we had a lady, Marla Mintz was here from the Furrow,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:51):**  and did an article on this this summer,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:53):**  and one of the things she really wanted to show was that.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:56):**  And we found a field,  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:57):**  so there again, that we took on last year,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:58):**  and versus some of our better fields,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:00):**  and the color changes.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:02):**  I had actually never put them side by side  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:04):**  on the same shovel,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:05):**  and it was drastic,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:07):**  how much darker and much more porous  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:09):**  the soils were side by side.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:11):**  I've been in one field,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:12):**  and then drove to a different field and looked,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:14):**  but to put them side by side,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:15):**  I thought was very powerful.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:17):**  And I didn't expect that we could make that change  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:20):**  in that amount of time.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:21):**  I guess it's sort of like watching your kids grow up.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:23):**  You don't notice them getting taller,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:24):**  but if you go away for a couple of years and come back,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:27):**  wow, there's been a big change here.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:29):**  So that was one of my most surprising things,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:34):**  is that it's actually happening.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:37):**  You made the miles and toured,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:39):**  and made the changes on your farm,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:40):**  and to actually see the changes happening,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:42):**  I think are pretty gratifying.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:47):**  Derek, I have a question for you that I enjoy asking people,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:51):**  and the way people have responded.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:54):**  What is something that you believe to be true  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:56):**  about modern agriculture  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:58):**  that is different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:06):**  You know, John, I knew this question was coming,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:08):**  and I still am not that prepared.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:10):**  I've been thinking about it quite a lot.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:14):**  What is one thing that really stands out for me?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:17):**  Or you can pick five if that's easier.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah, there's a lot of ways we can go with that answer,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:25):**  but one thing I guess that sticks out to me  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:26):**  that maybe people will relate to,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:28):**  especially in times when none of us are feeling really rich  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:31):**  with commodity prices being down,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:32):**  and, you know, ingrained prices being down,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:35):**  is that you don't have to be high input  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:37):**  to be profitable, highly profitable.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:39):**  Then I don't think there's any correlation there at all.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:43):**  It seems to me that the more we back away from synthetics,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:46):**  the more profitable we become.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:47):**  And there was a point that I thought  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:49):**  that our system was gonna crash,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:50):**  and I'm pretty sure my neighbors still do,  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:53):**  but it actually is getting better, not worse.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:56):**  And the profitability is, I guess,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:00):**  obviously that's what we're all trying to do  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:03):**  at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:04):**  But to watch the resource improve  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:06):**  at the same time as profitability,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:08):**  that's pretty exciting.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:10):**  And then it's just gonna continue,  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:12):**  both of them, to get better as we move forward.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:14):**  Yeah, that is a lot of fun.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:16):**  That's a lot of fun.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:18):**  Derek, what is a book or a resource  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:21):**  that you would suggest to other growers  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:24):**  who want to learn more?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:25):**  What has been a very useful source of information for you?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:30):**  I've read all of David Montgomery's books.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:33):**  I think they're great.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:35):**  Gabe Brown's new book I really liked.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:37):**  I thought it was very well written.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:39):**  And just food for thought,  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:42):**  I found the intercropping,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:43):**  I found more so in the information for that  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:47):**  is sort of more, well, social circles isn't the right word,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:49):**  but I mean, it's something we've discussed among peers.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:52):**  And I don't know if I actually had one original idea.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:56):**  I think I basically just took from here and there  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:59):**  and put together what worked on our farm.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:01):**  And that's something that I learned,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:02):**  I guess that I should make a point of saying  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:04):**  is that I came home from both Dakota Lakes  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:06):**  and Gabe Brown's farm and soon learned  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:08):**  that I have to adapt those practices.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:12):**  You gotta think about the context of your area,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:15):**  rainfall, soil types, those sorts of things.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:18):**  And yeah, I couldn't grow 200 bushel corn  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:20):**  in Minton, surprisingly.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:21):**  So we had to change up how we were thinking  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:24):**  and just use the general thoughts  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:27):**  or the general guidelines, I guess,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:28):**  and not the specifics.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:31):**  And that seemed to be what made the difference.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:33):**  And that's honestly why we got into intercropping  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:35):**  is because I saw the power that Gabe was having  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:37):**  with their cover crops or diverse cover crops.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:41):**  And I said, we need diversity.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:42):**  That is absolute, we need diversity.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:44):**  And how's the fastest way to do that is,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:46):**  well, for us, we thought was intercropping.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:49):**  And that was definitely one important piece  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:52):**  along the way for us.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:55):**  Derek, I really appreciate that comment.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:57):**  And I appreciate the example that you gave as well  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:00):**  of taking the principle of diversity  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:03):**  and shifting that principle from cover crops  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:07):**  to the actual crops that you're producing.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:09):**  And I think this is a very important point  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:11):**  for all of our listeners.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:12):**  Some of the feedback that I've received  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:14):**  in the podcast in the past has been that  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:16):**  people desire to have more practical how-to,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:19):**  nuts and bolts, how do you do this step by step?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:22):**  And that's occasionally useful,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:26):**  but more often, I believe, less useful  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:29):**  as you just described, Derek,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:30):**  because we have to adapt these ideas  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:33):**  to each of our individual operations.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:36):**  And some ideas may be directly transferable  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:39):**  and many of them may not be.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:40):**  I think it's very important.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:42):**  Really, the better we understand the science  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:45):**  or perhaps a better word would be to say  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:47):**  the better that we understand the principles,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:49):**  the concepts of what really needs to happen,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:52):**  then we can figure out a way to adapt those concepts  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:55):**  and principles specifically to our operation.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:57):**  Valuable point, I really appreciate you bringing that out.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:01):**  Yeah, I think one of the things I like to do  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:03):**  when I do go talk to crowds here and there  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:05):**  is try to relay my mistakes,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:08):**  because there's been many,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:09):**  and try to save some people from making the same mistakes.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:12):**  I guess, because I was lucky enough to sit in the seats  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:14):**  and have someone tell me those,  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:15):**  and yeah, minor changes can make big differences.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:19):**  And I think, like you said,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:21):**  I think understanding where you live  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:23):**  and how those are gonna fit in your operation  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:25):**  is very important.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:28):**  Yeah, Derek, I really enjoyed this conversation.

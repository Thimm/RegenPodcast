### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2019-12-16)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  I found that advancing eco-agriculture  in 2006 to bring this knowledge together  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:33):**  in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it  into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:40):**  It's my personal mission to have these  regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:46):**  the status quo against which all other  growing systems are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:51):**  that we have learned in the last decade  and make it available to everyone.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:00:58):**  or topics that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media or email me,  john at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:07):**  Be sure to sign up for our email list  at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.  Hope you enjoy and thank you for listening.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:15):**  Hi friends, welcome back  to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  This is John Kemp once more,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:20):**  and I'm very pleased to be able to have a conversation  with Derek Axton from Canada today.  This is going to be a bit of a different conversation  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:29):**  than you may have heard in the past.  And the distinct difference for me at least  is that Derek and I haven't known each other  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:36):**  for a long time.  But I've certainly interviewed other people  that I haven't known for a long time as well,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:41):**  but I may have read a lot of their work  and been familiar with their work.  And for Derek, that's not so much the case.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:47):**  So this is very much new territory for me.  We're going to have a fun conversation.  I know that Derek has a lot to contribute  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:01:55):**  and his name has certainly come up as a grower  that many would be wise to emulate.  So Derek, thank you very much for joining us today.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:03):**  And I've been looking forward to this conversation.  We're going to have a good time.  Yeah, thanks.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:07):**  Can you tell us a little bit about your journey,  your pathway, what has been the pathway that brought you  to the work that you're doing today in your farm  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:15):**  and where have you come from?  Yeah, to start with, thanks John for having me  and this will be a good conversation to have.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:22):**  So to start from the beginning, I guess it's the same story  I pretty much tell everyone that, you know, for us  it was a chance trip to Dakota Lakes Research Farm in 2007.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:35):**  And the one of the very first things  that Dr. Back took me out and showed me was an irrigator,  you know, obviously irrigating.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:41):**  And he asked the group of us that were there, you know,  how much rain we thought was entering the soil, you know,  in the form of irrigation.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:48):**  And we all guessed, you know, kind of a half an inch  because there was no visible runoff.  We were right beside the irrigator.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:02:54):**  And he tells us that it's two inches in nine minutes.  And for me, you know, back then that was an impossibility.  In our area where we farm now,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:04):**  we would have got a two inch downpour, you know,  obviously in nine minutes, the bulk of it's gonna run away.  And we know we live in an arid environment.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:10):**  We're sort of a 12 to 14 inch annual precipitation zone.  And the most limiting factor on our farm,  we feel is moisture.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:18):**  So that was very powerful to witness that.  So point forward-  Two inches in nine minutes.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:23):**  Two inches in nine minutes.  Yeah, that got my attention.  And we got off the golf cart  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:27):**  and walked in behind the irrigator.  It had just passed and we could walk in our sneakers  and you didn't get mud on your shoes.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:35):**  So, wow.  Yeah.  So it was pretty much just tell me what to do  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:40):**  because I need this in my life.  Because like I said, you know,  moisture is number one for us.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:45):**  Now I've learned there's so much room for improvement.  So he talked to us about diversity and crop rotation.  Things that, you know, we grew three crops at the time.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:03:54):**  We thought we were diverse.  Basically two crops is an alternation, not a rotation.  And we were growing three,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:00):**  but we didn't ever think about warm and cool season crops  and how to build rotation to improve soil structure  and do all these things that we wanna do  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:09):**  to make the water enter the soil.  Talked about earthworm channels and soil structure.  And it's the first time in my life  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:15):**  I ever saw someone put a shovel in the soil  and show us aggregates.  You know, that was the words that we didn't talk about.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:22):**  So I'm a slow learner.  So it took me quite a few trips back there.  And along the way,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:27):**  one time I wound up in a chance meeting with Gabe Brown.  And he invited us to his farm  on the way back from Dakota Lake.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:35):**  And same thing.  It was, you know, the shovel in the soil  and talked about rotation  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:39):**  and what we can do with live roots  and the power of live roots to build structure.  Cause, you know, Gabe is similar to us.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:45):**  I think they're in an 18 inch rainfall zone.  So I guess for me, it was easier to relate.  He's only about five hours from my farm.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:52):**  As far as weather patterns and growing conditions  and those sorts of things,  it's fairly close to what we can see some years.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:04:58):**  And we were in one of his packs  and he put his shovel in the soil  and it was the most beautiful black, crumbly,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:04):**  wonderful chocolate cake, whatever you like to call it, soil.  And we walked across the grid road  and put a shovel in his neighbor's soil.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:11):**  And I'm sure he's got the most famous neighbor.  And looked at, and it was minted.  Like it was exactly like what we had at home.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:21):**  So the difference between the poor soil  and the wonderful soil was management.  Right? So that for us was, well, we can do this.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:30):**  This is, and this was done in a matter of,  you know, 10 or 12 years.  So like, we need to do this.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:35):**  We need to make changes.  We need to make drastic changes, you know?  And when you talk with Gabe,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:39):**  he doesn't talk about inputs or, right?  We talk about growing things.  That's how the conversation goes.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:44):**  So we don't have livestock.  So it was a bit of a challenge, you know,  to come home and figure out how to input this diversity  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:52):**  into our farm.  And the simplest thing was we discovered intercropping  and that's where it started.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:05:57):**  2011, we started growing our first intercrops,  which are two different crops growing together  at the same time.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:04):**  I guess two or more.  We do two for the most part.  And we seed them together and we harvest them together.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:11):**  I know there's a bunch of all, you know,  different variations, but that's kind of what works  in our short growing season.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:17):**  Started in 2011.  By 2015, all of our broadleaf acres,  which is approximately half of our farm,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:23):**  was all intercropped.  So we started with some simple ones like canola pea,  which is pretty common,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:28):**  but we soon realized that I didn't want to have canola seed  on my farm.  So we transitioned into mustard,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:33):**  which is a higher value, lower yielding crop.  And we use that with the peas.  And we grow mostly specialty peas, you know, winter peas,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:41):**  forage peas, those sorts of things  that go into the cover crop market or into sprouting.  And those peas generally are kind of a jerk to harvest.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:48):**  They want to lay down,  but when you put them with a brassica, they'll trellis,  and it just works really, really well.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:06:55):**  So we did that.  Flax and chickpeas is another big one for us.  Chickpeas growing monocrop can be a bit of a disease problem.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:05):**  And we learned through a research farm  at Red vs. Saskatchewan,  and through another friend, Colin Rosengren,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:12):**  that had been doing this previous to me.  And like I said earlier,  I guess that our farm was sort of just a big group  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:19):**  of stolen ideas from other farms.  And the flax chickpea definitely wasn't ours,  but we soon seen the benefit  
**[0:07:24-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:24):**  and we adopted it straight away.  And it completely changed chickpea production for us.  We went from being a four fungicide pass crop to none  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:35):**  with better quality outcome.  Wow, that is impressive.  That was a pretty big change for us.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:42):**  We had actually quit growing chickpeas  because I had made a decision,  we don't use insecticides, we don't use seed treatments,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:48):**  we don't use fungicides, unless we're gonna lose a crop.  I mean, the fungicide, I'm not gonna die on that hill,  but that is never in the plan.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:07:57):**  And chickpeas, when you grow chickpeas here,  it's just, it's in the plan.  But in the intercrop situation,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:04):**  nine years out of 10, we can get away with no fungicides,  and then obviously better quality seeds.  So that was huge.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:11):**  And we've tried other combinations,  but those are kind of the ones we've fallen on.  Flax with lentils is another one.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:17):**  I guess we grow on a fairly large percentage of the farm.  So there's the benefits to harvestability,  the lack of disease,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:23):**  all these things work really well with the intercrops.  But the other neat thing is,  I'm sure you're aware of when,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:29):**  you know, a straight legume crop,  the problem with your carbonation ratio after harvest,  the residue just disappears, it just melts.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:36):**  What we've found with changing  the carbon nitrogen ratio mix of the residue after harvest,  we get a lot longer, more robust residue cover  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:45):**  that helps us through the winter  and then into next year's spring.  So we can actually keep our soils covered  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:50):**  with some form of armor.  Because sometimes we just don't have enough time  in the fall to get a fall seeded cover.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:08:56):**  That's probably our biggest challenge yet.  And the intercrops have really, really changed that for us.  Other neat things about intercrops for me was,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:05):**  when we started, we just made the conscious decision  to not use synthetic fertility.  That was sort of our,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:10):**  for lack of a better term, gateway drug,  to not using synthetic.  And we just didn't use it,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:16):**  and we didn't see a difference from our previous yields.  And then by 15, so half the farm was not using synthetics,  and that just gave us the confidence to keep backing away.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:27):**  Wow, so you just continued using fertilizers  and you did not see any yield loss from that  once you started doing the intercropping.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:35):**  Yeah, so it's interesting.  And when we talk about intercrops,  we talk about this land equivalency ratio.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:40):**  So it's like, imagine you have two 50-acre fields  and you plant one to canola and one to peas.  And you harvest them separately,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:47):**  and that would be a one as far as your net profit.  And if we planted both 50-acre fields and harvested them,  generally it's quite a bit higher.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:09:58):**  Like our farm is about a 1.25.  I know farms that are 1.35,  and I know there's a research farm  
**[0:10:04-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:04):**  that's seen upwards of 1.85.  Wow, that is so amazing.  Yeah, and with that comes other benefits  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:12):**  like the residue, the harvestability.  There's a lot of things that come with that  that you don't see maybe in your balance sheet.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:21):**  So yeah, intercrops have been a big part of it.  We were doing these things,  and Tanis, my wife, had taken Elanie Hamm's  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:30):**  Life in the Soils classes,  and we got very interested in biology, soil biology,  because you go to different presentations  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:36):**  and you hear people talk,  say the word biology or soil biology or soil health,  and they know we talk about it like it's air.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:42):**  Really, you can.  And the fact that we were able to learn  how to identify basically good and bad  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:47):**  and things that we want to see  and things that maybe we don't want to see  and how it's possible to manage those things  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:54):**  was a pretty powerful tool.  And I remember the very first time Tanis made a slide  and looked at it under the microscope,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:10:59):**  and we were fairly confident  we were doing a pretty good job.  We had been intercropping and cover cropping,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:05):**  and we'd been no-till,  and we weren't using much synthetics,  and we kind of had it figured out.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:09):**  And when we first looked at that slide  and it was mostly bacteria,  I tell you, that was pretty disappointing.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:15):**  We were expecting to see everything she had been learning  about seeing fungi and protozoa,  and there was the odd one,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:20):**  but boy, you had to look a long time.  So the next step was to make the compost windrows here.  We make about 2,000 tons a year now,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:30):**  and then we select from that 2,000 tons.  Generally, it's more than one different windrow,  and we use that to make a compost extract,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:39):**  and we put that down at seeding,  sort of in a liquid mixture with our micronutrients.  That's what goes in furrow,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:46):**  which, again, was a really good crutch for us.  We learned early on that that was a nice way to transition  from the liquid starter that we had been using  
**[0:11:54-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:11:54):**  to this was a fairly easy transition, low cost.  And drastic's not the right word,  but we've seen very good improvement in soil microbiology  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:03):**  since we started using that,  and I think we'll continue that for quite some time.  It's easy to do, it's low cost.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:10):**  What is the total of your nutrition management  and biology management today?  Are you applying the compost tea in furrow?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:17):**  Are there any nutrients with that?  Any other types of biostimulants or inoculants?  What's the scope of the nutrition management  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:23):**  that you're doing?  So, yeah, so this past year,  we had a tiny bit of molasses,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:28):**  and a few biological foods, I kind of think of it,  like obviously we're putting the biology out,  and obviously they function off plant-root exudates,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:35):**  but when we put it with a seed, there are no exudates.  So we do put a little bit of molasses  in our micronutrients that we use,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:44):**  that we basically kind of figured out  from looking at sap tests,  and we did a full extraction of our soils back years ago  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:51):**  when we first started with this,  and that was sort of how we based it,  and we've used sap analysis since to fine-tune.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:12:57):**  So that's how we come up with our micros,  and we add that then to our compost extract  just before it goes to the field,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:04):**  molasses and a few other odds and ends.  Nothing spectacular or shattering,  just cheap biological foods,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:10):**  and it's been seeming to work fairly well.  And based on what you're describing,  it does seem to be working fairly well.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:20):**  It seems to be a bit of an understatement.  One of the questions that immediately comes to mind,  you described the increased yields that you're seeing  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:28):**  just as a factor of the intercropping.  Have you noticed any improvements in quality  from all the various things that you're doing?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:37):**  Yes, I guess is the short answer.  We provide seed, obviously, for cover crop seed,  but we also do sprouting, so then again, it has to grow.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:46):**  And we've had very consistently high germination  in things since we started doing this,  and I can't explain why,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:13:55):**  but I know in sprouting, we have to be upper 90s  for them to want to accept those.  Even the cover crop seed, most people want to see germination  
**[0:14:03-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:03):**  in the high 90s, the higher the better, obviously.  But germination has been, we've seen an improvement for sure  in our grains after, and I guess that's one metric  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:13):**  to measure by.  And another thing we've started doing  is nutrient density testing with Dr. Jill Coperton.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:18):**  And she's developed a fairly good method  to test nutrients of our grains.  And according to what she's seen of ours  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:28):**  and the comparison she's done,  I guess I shouldn't speak for her,  but there are some things that they look at.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:34):**  I know zinc is one of the things  that she looks at specifically,  and industry kind of thinks 20 is good,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:39):**  25 is really good in a cereal grain.  And we've been seeing sort of upper 30s,  lower 40s in our zincs, like as an example.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:46):**  So that's been another metric we're measuring.  And I think that's something hopefully we can use  to help us market our grains  
**[0:14:53-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:14:53):**  more towards the human consumption side instead of the seed.  One of the topics I'd love to get your perspective on,  and you described at the beginning of our conversation  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:02):**  how impressive the soil was  at the Dakota Lakes Research Farm  with that tremendous water infiltration.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:10):**  And I'm sure you've mentioned that you've seen  some of those changes happening on your farm as well.  What do you think are the biggest  
**[0:15:17-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:17):**  and the most significant contributing factors?  Has it been diversity of crops?  Has it been the compost applications, combination of both?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:25):**  And within all of this, what is the impact of tillage?  Okay, so I don't...  That's a tough one to answer.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:37):**  This is probably opinion,  but I think it's a combination of things.  I guess one of the practice that we've been doing  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:42):**  out for five seasons is controlled traffic farming.  Still not 100% convinced it's the end all,  but we've been doing it.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:49):**  I think a combination of everything contributes,  but we have been doing consistent amounts  of infiltration tests on our farm.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:15:58):**  And when we compare soils that we've been farming this way  for since 2011 to some soils that we just took on last year,  a farm we bought beside us,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:08):**  we try to go out after a significant rainfall.  So when we have profile and then do our tests  and we'll get the first inch in say 25 to 35 seconds,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:18):**  and the second inch will be nine to 10 minutes  on our better soils and we'll go across the road  to the same kind of parent material  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:28):**  and we'll see under, well, basically first inch  after 10 minutes, we just kind of quit measuring.  So there's definite differences.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:35):**  And I really wish I could put my finger  on what certain thing we do makes a difference.  But I think if I had to pick one thing at the end of the day,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:45):**  I think it's live roots.  I think that's the thing we need to focus on.  And I don't know if it matters specifically  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:51):**  which live roots, but just more of them,  as far as I mean growing days,  if we can have more live roots,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:16:59):**  putting more carbon back in the soil via the exudates.  And that's how I feel personally anyway.  When you're doing your intercropping,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:09):**  are you ever doing more than two species together?  And would there be additional soil benefits  to doing additional species together?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:16):**  So we have tried three way intercrops for sure.  And we did see improvement in yield again.  And I probably wouldn't be able to comment accurately,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:25):**  probably tend to think that it would be,  but at the time the way we're set up  this separator intercrops is three  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:32):**  is a very difficult procedure  where two is very simple and fast.  So we just sort of abandoned that  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:38):**  until we're actually building a new seed facility right now.  And that was in our mind when we were doing this.  Cause I think I can see us going back to trying three  
**[0:17:46-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:46):**  cause there's some definite benefits to that.  One other thing we have done is incorporate like clovers  into say a pea canola or a pea mustard.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:17:58):**  So that gives us say another live root  that will grow past harvest and give us the diversity,  but we don't necessarily have to harvest it.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:07):**  And I kind of like to think of those companions  as a bridge for lots of things.  Obviously they'll help with mycorrhizae  
**[0:18:15-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:15):**  cause when you're growing a brassica,  but then the big problem with us is we have  such a shortfall we can't get a cover in good time.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:24):**  There's sort of crop maturity and then crop dry down,  harvest, seeding the cover crop, crop emergence.  Like this can be a five week process  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:31):**  of nothing growing in the soil  where if we have a companion like a clover  that just grows under the canopy  
**[0:18:36-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:36):**  and once we remove the canopy, the light penetrates  and then the companion can take off  and provide that live roots for the soil until freeze up.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:45):**  And that's been working fairly well for us.  That's been one that I got to actually do more of.  Yeah, I know that was a practice that we used to use  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:18:53):**  in the farm that I was growing up on  our fresh market vegetables  as we would grow a lagoon underneath vine crops.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:00):**  And as the fall approached,  the vine crops died off because of frost.  They no longer stayed in the ground  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:06):**  and we instantly had a lagoon that would take over.  Yeah, I think it's great.  Part of me wants to transition that now  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:13):**  to some sort of a grass  and I don't actually know what grass to use,  but I got a bit of a feeling  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:19):**  that we have too many legumes in rotation.  You know, it was same again,  it was a kind of a cut for nitrogen,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:26):**  but we're sort of learning that nitrogen  isn't nearly as difficult as I thought it was  four or five years ago.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:32):**  So I think we can start backing away  from some of our lagoon-based intercrops  and see what the future brings,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:37):**  but especially these companions as well,  I think we needed some kind of a grass.  But things like rye grass,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:43):**  I'm just scared of them becoming a weed  so we haven't experimented with them yet.  Maybe you have some suggestions?  
**[0:19:51-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:19:51):**  I don't have any immediate or obvious suggestions  because I'm not familiar enough with your environment.  But I would like to go back to your comment about nitrogen.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:01):**  I've also experienced that nitrogen is very easy.  So what has your process been with nitrogen?  Are you able to supply 100% of the crop's requirements  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:08):**  with crop residues and what is in the soil profile?  So what we've done is, like I said,  we don't provide any fertility to the, you know,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:17):**  the lagoon-based intercrops,  which is about half the farm acreage.  And then the other half of the farm  
**[0:20:22-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:22):**  will be different cereal crops,  you know, barley oats, wheat, derm.  We grow spelt, we grow some other ancient cereals.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:32):**  And what we've been doing ahead of those  is we actually spread,  so we're still using ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:37):**  I know, I'm sure everyone knows.  I spread sort of low amounts, kind of 80 to 100 pounds.  Gives us a little bit of an end kick  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:46):**  and a little bit of sulfur.  And I think it's, there again,  probably a bit of a crutch  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:51):**  because it really isn't that much.  And in terms of units, you know, it's like 16 pounds of N.  You know, like this year, for example,  
**[0:20:58-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:20:58):**  we can grow 150 bushel oats on 16 units of N.  You know, if you did the old typical removal rate,  something's wrong, right?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:07):**  It's coming from somewhere.  And that's sort of what we've been experiencing.  And when we look at our sap results,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:14):**  our ammonium levels are very high,  our nitrate levels are very low to almost non-existent.  So I'm assuming we're getting some kind of soil drive then.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:22):**  I guess I wish I knew more of the specifics,  but yeah, that's how we feel it's going.  I'm quite curious, what led you down the pathway  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:31):**  of considering controlled traffic?  And actually, before you answer that question,  I had a very interesting conversation earlier this summer  
**[0:21:38-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:38):**  with Jerry Hatfield and Michael McNeil  when I visited with them for a weekend.  And Jerry described how when no-till was first introduced  
**[0:21:48-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:48):**  and first advocated very strongly,  there were five rules, foundational rules,  that were considered to be necessary for successful no-till.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:21:57):**  And rule number one was that you remove all compaction  from the soil profile.  And rule number two was you do everything necessary  
**[0:22:08-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:08):**  to avoid recreating compaction layers in the soil.  Those were considered really foundational  to having successful no-till.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:18):**  And it seems to me, based on observations  on a lot of farms, that the no-till movement  has collectively seems to have lost sight of that.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:32):**  And you described in our earlier conversation  how you used to be farming no-till  but not seeing results,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:40):**  and now you're doing all these additional things.  So I'd be curious on your take on that.  What is your reaction?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:47):**  Well, it really lines up.  So the big turning point for me, I guess, was there's  a Nuffield scholar in Alberta by the name of Steve Larocque  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:22:58):**  who did his Nuffields on controlled traffic farming.  And same thing, we're lucky enough,  it's sort of a seven-hour, eight-hour drive from my farm.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:06):**  And I went to two of his field days.  And once again, so this would have been maybe 2011 or 12  when we were doing this.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:14):**  Sort of the same time we were really thinking  about making major changes,  realized that we need to change drastically.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:19):**  We need to make major changes.  And Steve was pretty much conventional.  Shank opener, basically high fertility, high yield,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:28):**  relatively low diversity.  But it was maybe five or six years,  and his soil structure was the closest I'd ever seen  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:37):**  to Dakota Lakes and Gabe Brown's farm  as anywhere I'd ever been.  To me, that was just another way to get there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:44):**  And I'm sure after a conversation you realize,  patience may be the wrong word,  but I just want it fixed now.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:51):**  And so instead of just doing one thing  and hoping for the best,  let's just do everything we possibly can  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:23:56):**  to improve the resource, to improve the soil.  And I thought controlled traffic was a fit.  And it's funny now that we've got into it,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:01):**  how many doors it's opened,  as far as things like maybe relay seeding  and some things that we're gonna start experimenting with.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:07):**  Last year we experimented with relay seeding  into standing cereal crops,  trying to get our covers established sooner.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:13):**  And controlled traffic just opened doors to that  that we didn't even realize were there.  And when I look at farms like Dakota Lakes and Gabe's  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:20):**  and they are doing a phenomenal job,  and I look around their yard  and look at how big their equipment is,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:26):**  nothing's very heavy in comparison  to the 65,000 pound tractors that we use,  that sort of thing, and very heavy combines.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:32):**  And we're out making passes at times of the year  when we really shouldn't be from a soil perspective.  So this gives us more sort of the freedom  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:42):**  to go harvest the crop or seed the crop,  maybe at times that we shouldn't be,  but it allows us to travel in the fields  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:48):**  without doing damage, I guess,  was sort of part of my thoughts.  And I've had pretty good conversations  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:24:55):**  with Jody in Minnesota, Jody DeJong-Hueys,  who's done a lot of research on this.  And I'm probably paraphrasing this wrong,  
**[0:25:01-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:01):**  but she basically told me that not much compaction happens  when it's really dry or saturated,  like really, really wet, like almost water.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:10):**  It's when soils are almost that perfect,  nice moisture for seeding or in the spring,  then when compaction can really occur badly and to depth.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:20):**  So I guess from taking all those little bits  from a whole bunch of different sources,  it just seemed to me that if we're dead serious  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:27):**  about this water infiltration thing,  that's something we're just gonna have to do.  And I think it takes time to see results.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:33):**  So we're in our fifth year now,  and I think we're starting to finally see some results.  I was just prepared to ask about that.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:41):**  What observations do you have now at the five-year mark?  What are you seeing?  Well, the water infiltration for sure,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:47):**  like we don't even check on trams,  there's not much sense checking there,  but those better fields, like I talked about,  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:25:52):**  sort of the 32nd inch, those are in the fields  that have been the longest CTF under our management  that have got the compost and had covered crops.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:00):**  That's been the trend.  Even walking in our fields, and I've had that comment from,  we've had quite a few visitors come in the summer,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:07):**  and people notice that when we walk in the fields,  and I'm sure you've felt the same too,  when you get in those really healthy soils,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:12):**  that the soils are soft to the foot, it seems like.  And I'm not saying that what we do  is the only way to do things.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:20):**  It's just been our observations,  and it's been a fit for us so far.  Derek, as you've been on this pathway  
**[0:26:27-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:27):**  and experiencing different things in your own farm,  what has been something that was unexpected?  What surprised you?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:37):**  What surprised me?  A few things.  I still struggle with that, obviously,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:42):**  because I'm still spreading nitrogen,  and according to my SAPs, I have lots, but we still do it,  I guess, out of forced habit.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:50):**  With the nitrogen example,  we actually have a lot of experience with SAP analysis  and looking at nitrogen,  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:55):**  and maybe you need to do an experiment  like you did at the beginning,  just don't apply it on a certain section,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:26:59):**  just see what happens.  Yeah, I think so.  I've actually left a couple checks already, so that's good.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:05):**  But I need to do some random applicators, I think,  is what I need,  because that's one of the other beautiful things  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:09):**  that control traffic,  is it allows us to do so many studies,  because every pass, well, not that every pass is the same,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:15):**  but there's definitely more consistency in what we do,  and we have these paths that we can follow,  we can do random replicates a little bit easier.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:25):**  I think that's something  that's definitely on the to-do list for 2020.  That's probably one of my big surprises,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:32):**  but the fact that we can make significant change  to our soil quality,  I know soil health, whatever you like to call it,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:39):**  but the color change,  it just makes you feel good to look in the soils  and see the color change.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:47):**  It's so hard to explain,  but we had a lady, Marla Mintz was here from the Furrow,  and did an article on this this summer,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:53):**  and one of the things she really wanted to show was that.  And we found a field,  so there again, that we took on last year,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:27:58):**  and versus some of our better fields,  and the color changes.  I had actually never put them side by side  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:04):**  on the same shovel,  and it was drastic,  how much darker and much more porous  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:09):**  the soils were side by side.  I've been in one field,  and then drove to a different field and looked,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:14):**  but to put them side by side,  I thought was very powerful.  And I didn't expect that we could make that change  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:20):**  in that amount of time.  I guess it's sort of like watching your kids grow up.  You don't notice them getting taller,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:24):**  but if you go away for a couple of years and come back,  wow, there's been a big change here.  So that was one of my most surprising things,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:34):**  is that it's actually happening.  You made the miles and toured,  and made the changes on your farm,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:40):**  and to actually see the changes happening,  I think are pretty gratifying.  Derek, I have a question for you that I enjoy asking people,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:51):**  and the way people have responded.  What is something that you believe to be true  about modern agriculture  
**[0:28:58-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:28:58):**  that is different from the mainstream view?  You know, John, I knew this question was coming,  and I still am not that prepared.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:10):**  I've been thinking about it quite a lot.  What is one thing that really stands out for me?  Or you can pick five if that's easier.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah, there's a lot of ways we can go with that answer,  but one thing I guess that sticks out to me  that maybe people will relate to,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:28):**  especially in times when none of us are feeling really rich  with commodity prices being down,  and, you know, ingrained prices being down,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:35):**  is that you don't have to be high input  to be profitable, highly profitable.  Then I don't think there's any correlation there at all.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:43):**  It seems to me that the more we back away from synthetics,  the more profitable we become.  And there was a point that I thought  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:49):**  that our system was gonna crash,  and I'm pretty sure my neighbors still do,  but it actually is getting better, not worse.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:29:56):**  And the profitability is, I guess,  obviously that's what we're all trying to do  at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:04):**  But to watch the resource improve  at the same time as profitability,  that's pretty exciting.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:10):**  And then it's just gonna continue,  both of them, to get better as we move forward.  Yeah, that is a lot of fun.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:16):**  That's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Derek, what is a book or a resource  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:21):**  that you would suggest to other growers  who want to learn more?  What has been a very useful source of information for you?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:30):**  I've read all of David Montgomery's books.  I think they're great.  Gabe Brown's new book I really liked.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:37):**  I thought it was very well written.  And just food for thought,  I found the intercropping,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:43):**  I found more so in the information for that  is sort of more, well, social circles isn't the right word,  but I mean, it's something we've discussed among peers.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:30:52):**  And I don't know if I actually had one original idea.  I think I basically just took from here and there  and put together what worked on our farm.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:01):**  And that's something that I learned,  I guess that I should make a point of saying  is that I came home from both Dakota Lakes  
**[0:31:06-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:06):**  and Gabe Brown's farm and soon learned  that I have to adapt those practices.  You gotta think about the context of your area,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:15):**  rainfall, soil types, those sorts of things.  And yeah, I couldn't grow 200 bushel corn  in Minton, surprisingly.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:21):**  So we had to change up how we were thinking  and just use the general thoughts  or the general guidelines, I guess,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:28):**  and not the specifics.  And that seemed to be what made the difference.  And that's honestly why we got into intercropping  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:35):**  is because I saw the power that Gabe was having  with their cover crops or diverse cover crops.  And I said, we need diversity.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:42):**  That is absolute, we need diversity.  And how's the fastest way to do that is,  well, for us, we thought was intercropping.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:49):**  And that was definitely one important piece  along the way for us.  Derek, I really appreciate that comment.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:31:57):**  And I appreciate the example that you gave as well  of taking the principle of diversity  and shifting that principle from cover crops  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:07):**  to the actual crops that you're producing.  And I think this is a very important point  for all of our listeners.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:12):**  Some of the feedback that I've received  in the podcast in the past has been that  people desire to have more practical how-to,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:19):**  nuts and bolts, how do you do this step by step?  And that's occasionally useful,  but more often, I believe, less useful  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:29):**  as you just described, Derek,  because we have to adapt these ideas  to each of our individual operations.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:36):**  And some ideas may be directly transferable  and many of them may not be.  I think it's very important.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:42):**  Really, the better we understand the science  or perhaps a better word would be to say  the better that we understand the principles,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:49):**  the concepts of what really needs to happen,  then we can figure out a way to adapt those concepts  and principles specifically to our operation.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:32:57):**  Valuable point, I really appreciate you bringing that out.  Yeah, I think one of the things I like to do  when I do go talk to crowds here and there  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:05):**  is try to relay my mistakes,  because there's been many,  and try to save some people from making the same mistakes.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:12):**  I guess, because I was lucky enough to sit in the seats  and have someone tell me those,  and yeah, minor changes can make big differences.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:19):**  And I think, like you said,  I think understanding where you live  and how those are gonna fit in your operation  
**[0:33:25-0:33:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:25):**  is very important.  Yeah, Derek, I really enjoyed this conversation.  I'm sure that our listeners will enjoy it very much as well.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:34):**  Yeah, for sure.  Well, thanks, John, for having me.  You're welcome.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/intercropping-and-regenerative-soil-management-with-derek-axten/#t=0:33:38):**  Thank you.  Thanks. Bye.  The team at AEA and I are dedicated

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 16:22:25)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kampf hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published and that  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:43):**  hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to bring this  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:49):**  knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:00:56):**  that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these regenerative  
**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:00):**  agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status quo against  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:07):**  which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to share the  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:12):**  knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone. While we have  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:17):**  developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:22):**  and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:40):**  topics that you would like for me to discuss, please connect on LinkedIn or on Twitter,

**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:54):**  very much like to hear from you and to hear your feedback. Be sure to subscribe to this podcast and  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:01:59):**  thank you very much for listening. Enjoy the show. Hi friends, welcome to the regenerative  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:03):**  agriculture podcast. I want to share some thoughts on the misuse and abuse of soil analysis. I've  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:10):**  observed far too many instances where growers and agronomists are using soil analysis in a fashion  
**[0:02:17-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:17):**  that is a detriment. It's a detriment to the crop that they're trying to grow. It's a detriment to  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:26):**  the long-term soil health and it's a detriment to the farmer's financial and economic viability as  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:31):**  well. The challenge lies not within the use of soil analysis themselves, but how we think about  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:38):**  them and how we use them to make recommendations. So here's the simple version. Soil analysis  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:48):**  are a very useful tool to help us balance nutrients to grow a really healthy high-yielding  
**[0:02:54-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:02:54):**  crop. They are not the goal. I've observed far too many instances where recommendations are made  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:03):**  based on a laboratory soil analysis report where the report is, okay, we have a desired value of  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:12):**  500 pounds of potassium per acre. I'm just making up hypothetical numbers and we found an existing  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:18):**  value of 200 pounds per acre. Therefore, we need to add an additional 300 pounds per acre of potash  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:25):**  where the idea is that we need to bring soil nutrient levels up to the desired value that  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:33):**  is reported on the soil analysis report based on a soil's CEC, cation exchange capacity,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:40):**  or to bring it into balance and ratio with other nutrients. This is a problem. This is a really big  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:45):**  problem and the reason it's a problem is because the goal of a farmer is not to produce a pretty  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:51):**  soil analysis. It's not the goal to make a nice looking piece of paper from the lab.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:03:56):**  Our goal as growers needs to be to grow a really healthy high functioning high-yielding crop and  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:04):**  nutrient applications needed to achieve that are usually very different from the nutrient  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:11):**  applications that are needed to make a pretty soil report. So the bottom line is that soil analysis  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:18):**  need to be used as a guideline with the goal of growing a really healthy crop. The soil analysis  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:24):**  cannot become the goal in and of itself. That is the challenged thinking that has emerged in some  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:30):**  areas which has the capacity to cause major frustration and major headaches and quite simply  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:36):**  can drive growers right into major financial disruption on their growing operation if they're  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:40):**  not careful. On the other hand, there's also this thought pattern of applying a soil analysis  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:48):**  and applying the nutrients that are needed for crop removal. So instead of looking at a soil  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:52):**  analysis and there are many growers who've reported the experience of submitting a soil  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:04:59):**  analysis to three different laboratories and getting three very different lab reports of what  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:05):**  the nutrient profile of the soil actually is and yet still getting exactly identical nutrient  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:12):**  applications. This is because so many people are still looking at nutrient removal and asking the  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:19):**  question how much nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. is required to grow this crop and what are  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:25):**  the nutrients that we need to apply to achieve a certain level of yield with a fairly complete  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:33):**  disregard for the nutrients that are actually present in the soil profile. And this is equally  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:39):**  a fallacy. These are both very simplistic approaches. They're coming from a different  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:44):**  perspective but they're very simplistic and they're often used simply I believe because  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:49):**  people love simplicity. There's this desire for simplicity because soil science, if you really  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:05:56):**  get into it, soil science is such a complicated science and it's complicated because there is so  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:02):**  much that we don't know. When I speak with soil scientists and microbiologists, the few drops of  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:11):**  information that we think we know about soil biology and agronomy compared to the ocean of  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:18):**  things that we don't know can be quite overwhelming. So we know that soil analysis and soil science is  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:26):**  to some degree still a very imprecise science and that drives a desire for a more simplistic approach  
**[0:06:35-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:35):**  to balancing plant nutrients. So the question becomes how do we use soil analysis as a guideline  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:45):**  to give us useful insights into what is happening with soil with plant health and how do we manage  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:06:51):**  it to help us grow a really high yielding and healthy crop. I believe there are two pieces,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:00):**  major pieces, which our current soil analysis does not take into consideration, which any good  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:06):**  agronomist needs to take into consideration when making recommendations. Many of us are already  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:11):**  thinking about crop nutrition requirements and crop removal rates. We're already thinking about  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:17):**  what is present in the soil and what might be needed to bring the soil up into balance,  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:23):**  but there are two other pieces that we need to think about as well that we often ignore.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:27):**  First of those two is taking into consideration the tremendous nutrient reserves that already  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:34):**  exist in the soil profile that do not show up on a soil analysis. So the soil analysis  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:41):**  methodology that is used today and there's a number of different methodologies used in  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:46):**  different types of growing environments and so forth, but the goal for each of them is to  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:51):**  develop an approximation of the nutrients that are available for this crop to grow on this  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:07:58):**  growing season. That's the goal. That's what they desire to extract and be able to give us a window  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:06):**  and insights into nutrient availability. They deliberately exclude the tremendous reserve  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:13):**  of nutrients that are locked up in the soil profile. So throughout North America,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:18):**  particularly for much of the Midwestern soils where we have clay silt loam soils,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:24):**  an overarching general number that is often used is many of our soils in the top six inches  
**[0:08:31-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:31):**  will contain upwards of 40,000 pounds of potassium per acre and 9,000 pounds of phosphorus per acre,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:39):**  just in the top six inches. So there's this tremendous nutrient reserve and nutrient bank  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:46):**  account that will never show up on a soil analysis. The soil analysis will not show you the  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:52):**  reserve that is present in the soil profile. This is the one other piece that we need to take into  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:08:57):**  consideration is what is the nutrient reserve that we can tap into and release over time?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:03):**  There are many growers and many agronomists who have 20, 30 years of experience who have observed  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:10):**  that on fields where nutrients were not applied for a long period of time, according to crop  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:17):**  removal rates, there should have been a decline of available phosphorus and potassium and other  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:23):**  nutrients. But that didn't happen. In fact, in some cases, there was a gradual increase where  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:29):**  phosphorus and potassium became more and more available. And I'm using these two as an example,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:32):**  because they're two of the macronutrients that we need to pay a lot of attention to. The same holds  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:37):**  true of magnesium and calcium and other nutrients as well. So this piece that I'm suggesting we also  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:44):**  need to take into consideration is understanding the geological profile of the soil that we're  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:49):**  working with. If we have a limestone based soil, a limestone bedrock, there are going to be some  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:09:56):**  soil profiles that don't have large levels of phosphorus or potassium or calcium that they can  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:01):**  release. So this is not universally true of all soils, but many soils do have tremendous nutrient  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:07):**  reserves that we can tap into. And I'm suggesting that we need to understand those better need to  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:12):**  understand what they are. Then the next piece that we need to take into consideration and understand  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:19):**  better is how do we tap into them and how do they become available. This is really a function of  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:25):**  soil biology. When you have very active soil biology, active organic matter, available carbon  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:33):**  for the biology to work with, you can tap into these new tremendous nutrient reserves and make  
**[0:10:37-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:37):**  them available to plants. And this again, is a process that we don't understand well. We are  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:48):**  gaining an understanding and a window into the results we can see on some soils that we have  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:55):**  tremendous nutrient availability, even without nutrient applications for very long periods of  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:10:59):**  time. So we observe some of the outcomes of what is happening when we have really healthy soils,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:05):**  and we don't always fully understand how it works. But the important piece is that when we do have  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:12):**  good biology, very active biology, we can tap into these tremendous nutrient reserves. For this reason,  
**[0:11:18-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:18):**  I believe it is very important for us to not apply agricultural inputs that suppress soil biology.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:28):**  Let's try to reduce our management practices, whether they be excess of tillage, whether that be  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:35):**  putting on pesticides or fertilizers such as anhydrous ammonia or potassium chloride that  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:42):**  have a very negative effect on soil biology. Let's try to limit product applications that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:48):**  suppress soil biology, because the more we suppress soil biology, the less we're going  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:11:53):**  to tap into these nutrient reserves. And this is what has happened on many operations and many  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:00):**  soils over the last several decades. Soils have become so biologically depressed and biologically  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:06):**  degraded as a result of continuing nutrient applications with a suppressive effect on soil  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:11):**  biology that we have arrived in a place where for some soils, there is very little or perhaps even  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:19):**  no nutrient release happening from the locked up soil reserves. So this is something that we have  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:25):**  to recover on our agricultural soils and something that we can recover. One of the pieces that I'm  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:31):**  always impressed with is the incredible resilience and regenerative capacity of natural systems.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:39):**  All we need to do is begin managing soils differently, begin managing our crops differently,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:46):**  and soil health has the capacity to regenerate incredibly quickly if we simply give it the  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:51):**  materials that it needs and get out of the way. The beauty of these ecosystems and working with  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:12:57):**  soil health and plant health is that they were designed to work. They were designed to function  
**[0:13:01-0:13:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:01):**  and to be truly sustainable without a lot of human intervention. When you work with an agronomist or  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:09):**  a consultant or if you're making your own recommendations, in addition to thinking about  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:14):**  crop removal, in addition to thinking about the nutrients that are being reported on soil analysis,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:19):**  also think about these other two pieces. Think about the nutrient reserves that are held in your  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:24):**  soil profile and how you can use biology to tap into those two nutrient reserves. It is these two  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:30):**  ideas that are really at the foundation of developing truly long-term sustainable and even  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:37):**  regenerative agricultural ecosystems. You want to work with people who use that approach and who use  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:44):**  this thought process to develop ecosystems on your operation. This podcast was brought to you  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:51):**  by a great company that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture, the leader in regenerative  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:13:58):**  agriculture since 2006. At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:14:06):**  and regenerative ways to grow crops. We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:14:12):**  and disease, and to grow healthy plants we must first think in a different way about agriculture,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:14:19):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life, about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:14:27):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-fallacy-of-perfect-soil-reports/#t=0:14:32):**  with less risk of crop failure. In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.

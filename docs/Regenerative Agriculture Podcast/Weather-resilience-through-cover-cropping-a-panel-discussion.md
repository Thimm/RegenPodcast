**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:37):**  in fields where planting has been delayed  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:39):**  and we haven't been able to get crops  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:41):**  into the ground in time.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:43):**  So we've talked a lot about how to use cover crops  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:46):**  in anticipation of next year's crop  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:49):**  and to be able to regenerate soil health  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:51):**  and reduce weed pressure, safeguard against erosion,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:55):**  and improve our overall farming system.  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:58):**  I really enjoyed hosting the panel.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:59):**  We had great conversations with some very key points  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:04):**  that I think you will all find interesting.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:06):**  I hope you find the information useful and actionable.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:09):**  All right, well, welcome everyone.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:12):**  Today we have a bit of a slightly different format.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:15):**  I've invited several excellent growers and farmers  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:19):**  who I've had the privilege of working with  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:20):**  over the last couple of years to this conversation as well.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:23):**  And so we have Steve Groff, cover crop coach,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:27):**  the infamous pioneer who was using cover crops  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:29):**  before there were very many cover crops  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:31):**  being used in the agriculture space.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:33):**  Glad to have you, Steve.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:34):**  We have David Clineshmit,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:36):**  who's an agronomist and grower from Illinois,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:39):**  and Brad Hobrock, also from Illinois, and then David Chance.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:43):**  David Chance, if I recall, correct this from Indiana.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:45):**  Am I right about that, David?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:46):**  That's correct, that's correct.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:47):**  Lebanon, Indiana.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:51):**  All right, so I want to thank all of you  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:53):**  for joining the conversation discussion today  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:57):**  and wanted to just have a open conversation.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:01):**  In our consulting work, we're having many interactions  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:04):**  with growers who are puzzled and perhaps unfamiliar  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:08):**  with the opportunities that they have in the seasons,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:12):**  looking at the latest USDA report.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:15):**  At this moment, we still have a significant number  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:18):**  of unplanted acres, particularly here in the state of Ohio.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:21):**  As of the beginning of this week's report,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:23):**  we've had about 80% of corn acres planted  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:26):**  and about 65% of soybean acres planted.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:30):**  And considering this is the first week in July,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:32):**  certainly pushing up against the window  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:35):**  of what opportunities remain for the season.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:38):**  And so I often am surprised by the number of growers  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:41):**  who are unfamiliar with the opportunities that they have  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:45):**  and what can still be done at this point in the year.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:48):**  So I wanted to have a conversation together  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:50):**  with us as a group to share some thoughts and ideas about what  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:54):**  the possibilities are.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:56):**  So Steve, perhaps I'll go to you first.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:00):**  There is this idea that if it's too late to plant corn  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:05):**  and coming the window is rapidly closing on planting beans,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:08):**  then that's it.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:10):**  There's not a lot of opportunities  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:11):**  left for us in the year.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:12):**  And the only thing that is left when  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:15):**  there's a common perception that I've come across  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:18):**  that planting cover crops is a significant expense.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:21):**  We have limited economic resources.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:23):**  And that's not something we should invest in such a  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:25):**  challenge and troubled year.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:26):**  How would you respond to that?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:28):**  I would respond by saying this is a golden opportunity  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:32):**  to make lemonade out of lemons.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:35):**  So if you don't get your cash crop in  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:37):**  and you've always wanted to try cover crops,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:40):**  you have no excuse not to try cover crops.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:44):**  The thing of it is we have so many options.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:46):**  Steve, I can't afford it.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:48):**  No, you can't afford it.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:50):**  Well, yeah, you know what?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:54):**  The thing about it is, though, we  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:56):**  have these options of multiple species and everything.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:58):**  We can actually create and make nitrogen for next year.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:02):**  In our corn crop, I have seen time and time again,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:06):**  we're in a prevent plant situation  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:08):**  or in a similar opportunity, like after wheat,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:11):**  which is kind of the same kind of a planting window here,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:15):**  that farmers have had to use little to no nitrogen  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:18):**  the following year for their corn.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:20):**  So that should get your attention, John,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:22):**  because nitrogen is an expense.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:25):**  So that would be my first comment to that.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:27):**  But what is the value of increasing your soil's health,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:31):**  increasing the agri-stability, all these many things  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:34):**  that cover crops can give for you?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:38):**  So I would say, in my experience,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:41):**  I'm talking to many, many farmers who  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:42):**  have said that this is a situation where really it got  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:45):**  them into cover crops, where they were actually  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:47):**  tested and tried them, and they were able to see the benefits.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:52):**  I have heard of situations where farmers had wet spots that  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:56):**  dried out, they planted cover crops,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:58):**  and they said from then on, they saw a difference  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:01):**  in their fields where those cover crops were planted.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:06):**  Thank you, Steve.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:07):**  David Chance, what experience have you  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:09):**  had with cover crops in similar situations,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:11):**  and what advice do you give to growers when you speak  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:13):**  to them in this situation?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:14):**  That's a good point.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:16):**  I guess we've been working with cover crops here on our farm  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:21):**  since 2006, and have tried a lot of different types of things.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:25):**  And I'll kind of echo what Steve had said as well,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:28):**  in terms of this is kind of an opportunity  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:31):**  to actually kind of follow the ground  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:34):**  and to grow a diverse species cover crop,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:39):**  and break some of the normal corn-soybean rotations  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:43):**  that we have, and also able to probably grow  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:47):**  a significant amount of our nitrogen for next year  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:50):**  as well, and basically add liquid carbons  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:55):**  of different taste to the microbes,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:59):**  and really kind of generate, kind of jumpstart  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:03):**  a microbial system that will have lasting benefit.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:06):**  I see it as a very, very large opportunity,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:09):**  and there's a lot of different species  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:12):**  and a lot of different combinations that can be used.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:17):**  And some of them can be just as simple as just oats and clover.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:22):**  It doesn't have to be 16 or 20 species.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:25):**  It can be what you want to make it,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:28):**  but it can be very beneficial, and it really  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:30):**  is a golden opportunity.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:33):**  In scripture, if you look at the Old Testament,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:36):**  it talks about a seven-year rest.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:39):**  And we've not really had, in my career,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:43):**  or probably the history of the United States,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:45):**  a seven-year rest on our lands.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:49):**  And looking at this little bigger picture,  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:53):**  I feel like God's maybe giving us this opportunity  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:55):**  to have a rest that our land needs,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:59):**  and cover crops can play into this rest very, very well.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:03):**  Well, if you continue the biblical narrative,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:07):**  when the nation of Israel did not provide their land  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:11):**  with the rest voluntarily, it was forced upon them.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:15):**  Yes, it was, rather brutally.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:21):**  One of the questions that comes to mind for me,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:23):**  there's been a recent announcement  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:25):**  that the USDA is permitting the cropping of cover crops  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:29):**  and the harvesting of cover crops in September 1st instead  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:34):**  of November, as has historically been the case.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:38):**  And this raises a question mark about the role of crop  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:42):**  insurance and USDA in influencing decision making,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:47):**  et cetera.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:48):**  But one of the questions that I would have for you as a group,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:50):**  and perhaps Brad will go to you next  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:53):**  if you have any comments on this question,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:55):**  is how much of an influence should the ability  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:59):**  to harvest your cover crops make on your cover crop decisions  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:04):**  and what you decide to do on your farm?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:08):**  At this point in time, especially due to cattle  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:13):**  producers who need the hay for feeding,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:17):**  it does create an opportunity for an additional income source  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:21):**  due to the USDA changing that date to September 1st.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:25):**  So it definitely plays a big role, potentially,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:28):**  for I know a lot of people in central Illinois  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:31):**  and probably the Corn Belt.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:34):**  Brad, with the availability of additional income opportunity,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:37):**  I guess the question that is in my mind  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:38):**  is, how does that opportunity compare with the opportunity  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:42):**  to just grow a cover crop and sequester nitrogen  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:45):**  for next year's crop, as Steve was describing?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:48):**  Can you do both of those at the same time?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:49):**  Is it an either or discussion?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:51):**  How do you make those decisions and choices?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:53):**  Can it be done at the same time?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:55):**  Yes, it can.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:57):**  I think there's an opportunity also  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:59):**  that having discussions with some of the local cattle  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:03):**  producers to see what their needs are.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:07):**  Certainly not everybody is going to look at that avenue.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:10):**  Still, in my opinion, the greatest benefit  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:13):**  behind cover crops is improving active carbon levels  
**[0:13:17-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:17):**  in the soil.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:17):**  And we've proven that that also is a very, very close  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:22):**  correlation to yields the following year as well.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:26):**  Thanks, Brad.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:27):**  David Plinschmidt, we haven't heard your voice yet.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:31):**  The conversations you've been having with growers  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:34):**  that you work with, what are you hearing from the countryside  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:38):**  in terms of growers' interest in cover crops?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:41):**  And what are the major reservations and question  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:43):**  marks that they have?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:45):**  So this year reminds me a lot of 2012, really,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:48):**  with our drought year.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:49):**  It gave us an opportunity to plant cover crops then.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:53):**  And it's kind of echoing what Steve and David said.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:56):**  It's given us a golden opportunity  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:58):**  to go ahead and seed some things we typically wanted.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:02):**  A couple of the things that I hear a lot of, though,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:04):**  is guys are just looking at cereal rye and maybe radishes  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:10):**  or something.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:11):**  And we kind of got to understand the difference  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:14):**  between cool season and warm season, grasses and legumes,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:18):**  and when they should be planted for the best success.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:22):**  So that's probably the biggest concerns I hear.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:26):**  And then, of course, if a guy had cut down  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:30):**  any fertilizer or any residual herbicide applications  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:35):**  on those fields and looking to see what species could then  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:38):**  be planted and trying to make a plan for that,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:42):**  also managing the carbon and the nitrogen for that following  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:45):**  crop year as well.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:46):**  Thanks, David.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:47):**  That leads me to a question that I have for each of you.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:51):**  Conversations that I have many growers  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:53):**  are asking the question, particularly  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:54):**  those who don't have a history with growing cover crops,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:58):**  is what should I choose?  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:01):**  This is now the beginning of July.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:03):**  What are the cover crops that I can choose  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:05):**  that are going to make the biggest difference for me?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:09):**  Let me see.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:10):**  Let's start with David's chance.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:12):**  David, you mentioned that it can be something  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:14):**  as simple as oats and clover.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:15):**  But the grower has an opportunity  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:17):**  to put in something to really optimize  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:20):**  what is happening in his soil.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:21):**  What would your general recommendations be?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:23):**  Where would you begin?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:24):**  It's kind of another good question.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:27):**  I actually had a friend this morning  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:30):**  that had a situation where he was looking at the nitrogen  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:33):**  production and looking at his equipment  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:35):**  that he has to actually plant cover crops,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:37):**  15-inch row planter.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:39):**  This particular event, probably the biggest bang for his buck  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:43):**  would be using Austrian winter peas,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:47):**  inoculated probably in 15-inch rows planted RTK.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:53):**  So that he would have the option to plant corn  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:57):**  in between those next year and have a nitrogen source.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:00):**  It would probably be a very big bang for his buck,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:04):**  however, a single specie.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:06):**  So that's one way to look at it.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:09):**  A lot of times, the biggest bang for the buck,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:11):**  in my opinion, in my experience, has  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:14):**  been mixing basically a grass, a good grass specie,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:19):**  with a good legume specie, with a good brass specie,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:23):**  and a good broadleaf specie that kind of get along  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:26):**  with each other.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:27):**  Don't shade each other out, but offer those different  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:33):**  synergies, you might say.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:35):**  It can be as simple as four things together,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:37):**  five things together.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:39):**  If somebody is really hesitant on trying cover crops,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:44):**  the oats, radish, medium red clover,  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:47):**  valanza clover, something like that,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:49):**  can be fairly economical and still offer a multitude  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:53):**  of species that are going to break those rotations  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:56):**  and really start turning the microbiome and that soil on,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:01):**  which is really, at the end of the day, what we're after doing.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:03):**  We're after covering the soil, anchoring it down,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:07):**  growing roots, putting that liquid carbon in there  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:10):**  for those microbes, kind of accomplish  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:12):**  a multitude of those things.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:14):**  So it kind of depends on the situation.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:16):**  But I do generally like to mix those four types of species.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:21):**  Good grass, for instance, oats.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:23):**  We'll use a lot of oats in our mixes,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:25):**  probably along with buckwheat.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:27):**  Buckwheat's a really nice broadleaf  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:30):**  that seems to scavenge a really nicely.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:34):**  We've done some flax as a broadleaf.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:36):**  We like the cilia, but it's so darn expensive,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:39):**  it becomes a little bit difficult to manage  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:41):**  on a cost perspective.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:42):**  And then legumes, we'll work with peas, clovers, vetches.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:48):**  And I'm not as big on brassicas anymore as I used to be.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:53):**  I still like radishes.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:54):**  I still like turnips, kale, things of that nature.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:57):**  But I just kind of sprinkle those in anymore.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:02):**  I find more value in the grasses, legumes,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:05):**  and some of the broadleafs.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:08):**  Don't know if that answers your question,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:10):**  but that's typically how I'd respond.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:14):**  That's a great answer.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:15):**  Thank you, David.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:16):**  And I'd like to go to Brad Hobrock.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:19):**  Brad, what general recommendations  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:22):**  would you make to growers who are just starting out  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:24):**  and have questions about how to begin with cover crops?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:27):**  David Chance really hit the nail on my head in a lot of aspects.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:31):**  But with that said, I also do believe  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:34):**  that we can start fairly simple.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:36):**  He had also mentioned kind of oak-clover mixture.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:40):**  Fairly simple, fairly economical mixture there.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:45):**  But also, if there is a possibility still  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:47):**  for maybe bailing some of this for some local cattle  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:51):**  producers, I think that's a discussion  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:53):**  that you need to have also with some of those folks  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:56):**  to make sure that you are planting  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:59):**  what they may want or need.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:01):**  Very good thought.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:02):**  Thanks, Brad.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:02):**  Brad, would you consider, would it be appropriate  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:05):**  or would there be an appropriate trade-off  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:07):**  to consider planting a crop that matures quickly  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:10):**  as a forage crop, such as, say, oats, for example?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:13):**  Although it might be getting late for those.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:15):**  But still, producing a forage crop  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:17):**  before the September 1 deadline, is that something that  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:20):**  would still be a viable option?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:22):**  In certain areas, I think so.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:24):**  But if you look here in central Illinois,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:27):**  it's raining here again right now.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:29):**  We had another 2 and 1 half to 3 inches here a couple of days  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:32):**  ago.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:33):**  And so there are still a lot of fields  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:35):**  that have water standing on them as well.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:38):**  And so due to current soil conditions,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:43):**  that actually might be a limiting factor in that respect.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:46):**  Got it.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:47):**  Thanks, Brad.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:49):**  Steve Groff, you look at a lot of cover crop opportunities  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:54):**  and challenges and strange situations all over the world.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:58):**  Where would you make a recommendation  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:00):**  to begin with cover crop planting?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, well, first of all, I would  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:04):**  say start thinking about what do you intend  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:06):**  to plant next year in that field.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:08):**  That can help set up the type of species you might want to use.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:12):**  The thing, too, that I want to mention  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:14):**  is that there's hardly anything better than sorghum savangrass  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:18):**  to be planted now.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:19):**  It grows very well in the heat of summer.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:22):**  And it puts carbon in the soil.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:24):**  But there's one thing that we rarely hear about.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:27):**  These soils, a lot of them have been saturated.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:29):**  And when they do dry out, which we don't know yet.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:33):**  Some of them, we don't know when that's going to be.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:36):**  The mycorrhizae population has been suppressed because  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:39):**  of extreme wet situation.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:41):**  And that's something that people don't think about.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:43):**  I ran into this in some previous wet periods of time  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:47):**  where you have something like sorghum sudan  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:50):**  can really help rejuvenate that mycorrhizal population that's  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:53):**  going to help us.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:54):**  I think that's some of the benefits  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:55):**  that we haven't really focused in on.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:58):**  So I'll just say sorghum sudan is what you want to build it on.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:01):**  And then some legumes would be sun hemp and cowpeas.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:05):**  Those are the two, seems to be the cream  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:07):**  of the crop for the legumes.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:09):**  And then throwing a brass skin there like a radish now  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:12):**  is kind of the common tactic that's being used.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:16):**  The nice thing about those fast-growing summer  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:19):**  legumes, sun hemp, cowpeas, and or sorghum savangrass  
**[0:21:22-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:22):**  is the grass.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:22):**  They grow very quickly.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:23):**  The radishes run through the canopy, don't do much.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:26):**  And then when we have that first killing frost in the fall,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:30):**  then that opens up the canopy.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:31):**  The radish then starts doing its job.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:34):**  It helps pick up the nitrogen that the legumes made,  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:37):**  carries it over to the following season.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:40):**  So that's a nice three-way mix.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:41):**  Of course, there's another dozen or two dozen other species  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:44):**  you can mix in there.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:46):**  So I would, again, I appreciate the theme here.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:49):**  Keep it simple.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:50):**  But if you're one who is down the road  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:54):**  or you feel confident that someone's  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:56):**  going to give you a good mix, this  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:58):**  is an opportunity to plant that 12-way mix.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:00):**  Nothing else you can brag to your neighbors  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:02):**  how many species you had.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:03):**  But still, I think there is some validity to it  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:05):**  if it's created correctly.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:08):**  So that's just some of my comments  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:09):**  to build on what was previously stated.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:11):**  Great comments, Steve.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:13):**  And we've actually observed tremendous responses  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:18):**  when planting cover crops.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:19):**  And in this situation, when you have preventive planting  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:22):**  due to flooding and inoculating those cover crop  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:24):**  seeds with mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:27):**  We have a lot of growers who use bio coke gold for that.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:29):**  And the results are really substantial.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:31):**  Because as you said, the soils are really  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:34):**  suppressed in this situation.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:36):**  One of the things that I haven't heard at all,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:39):**  and just putting it out there as a question mark,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:42):**  should we consider using summer annuals that  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:46):**  have a relatively short lifespan, such as buckwheat?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:49):**  Do they fit into cover crops at this time of the year at all?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:52):**  And I'll just put that out there for anyone who wants to answer.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:56):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:58):**  Buckwheat and sunflowers.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:00):**  Why sunflowers, David?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:03):**  Well, so I kind of look at what weeds really  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:05):**  thrive in our environment.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:06):**  And we have a lot of pigweeds.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:08):**  And so if you really look at the root structure of a pigweed  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:11):**  and the root structure of a sunflower,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:13):**  they almost mimic each other.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:15):**  But not only that, but it's kind of a taproot there as well.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:19):**  But very, very good pollinator to attract  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:23):**  in some of our beneficial predatory insects as well.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:27):**  It also helps to bring zinc and even calcium  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:32):**  available in that soil profile.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:34):**  And then by next spring, when you dig up  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:37):**  around those roots, you'll find a tremendous amount  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:41):**  of earthworms around there.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:43):**  David, Chance, you also responded pretty hard  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:45):**  to leave that buckwheat is a really great idea.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:47):**  What would be reasons you would choose buckwheat?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:49):**  And what would be reasons that you would not choose buckwheat?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:52):**  You know, this early in the season, it will go to seed.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:55):**  It seeds very quickly, and flowers, it seeds very quickly.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:00):**  And will reseed itself.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:01):**  And typically in the spring, in the following spring,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:05):**  it will germinate and probably has the potential to be a weed.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:11):**  We are a conventional grower.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:13):**  So we do have the opportunity to chemically terminate  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:18):**  most of our cover crops.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:19):**  So that has not been an issue with us.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:22):**  I actually kind of like the idea of that reseeding  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:26):**  and kind of getting started and then terminating it  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:30):**  prior to the next crop.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:33):**  But we have had buckwheat.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:34):**  There is obviously tremendous insect attraction.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:38):**  Bees, floss, they're just different things.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:41):**  And I like some of these flowering things,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:44):**  typically after wheat.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:45):**  And in the pre-bit situation, it's similar to after wheat.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:48):**  We can put some things like buckwheat or flax or phacilia  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:52):**  and sunn hemp that actually flower  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:55):**  at different kind of times.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:56):**  And it really is attractive to all these beneficial insects.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:01):**  And where we've had buckwheat, where  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:02):**  we have done pretty intensive soil testing  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:05):**  without added minerals through purchase,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:09):**  we have seen phosphorus levels and potassium levels  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:12):**  actually increase significantly on our soil testing.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:17):**  So I like buckwheat.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:19):**  It's a reasonable price.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:21):**  It's easy to put in.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:22):**  Kind of look at the plant.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:23):**  It's kind of a puny-looking plant.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:25):**  You dig the roots up.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:26):**  They're not super impressive.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:28):**  But it's one of those things that  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:30):**  must be the sugars that it produces through those roots.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:32):**  It must be magic to those microbes.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:35):**  In my personal observation, the two cover crops  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:39):**  which loosen soil and increase soil  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:42):**  aggregation really substantially are oats and buckwheat.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:45):**  They're just very difficult to match in what they do.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:48):**  And also, they have, as you described, both of those crops  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:51):**  have a substantial impact on increasing phosphorus  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:55):**  availability.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:56):**  And to the comment about weeds, I always hear this comment  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:00):**  that, oh, buckwheat can become a weed.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:03):**  And my response to that is, if you can't control buckwheat  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:06):**  as a weed, then you really can't control anything else either.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:08):**  Because even if you're not using herbicides,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:13):**  if you're an organic grower and you're doing cultivation,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:15):**  buckwheat is so easy to cultivate out.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:17):**  If you have a problem with buckwheat,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:19):**  you really have a problem.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:20):**  You have a bigger problem.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:22):**  Steve, do you have any thoughts or input on buckwheat?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:26):**  I would say, and I like buckwheat  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:28):**  for all the reasons mentioned, but again,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:31):**  what is your next crop going to be?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:33):**  And when is it going to be?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:36):**  Let's just theoretically say you might go to wheat.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:39):**  Not many people do, but you might go to wheat.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:41):**  So then that's going to be probably in October.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:43):**  So you don't have a lot of time there to buckwheat.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:46):**  It'd be very appropriate to do that.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:48):**  The problem with buckwheat when you use sorghum  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:50):**  Sudan and sun hemp and even cowpeas  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:52):**  is it kind of almost passes the grows.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:54):**  It's a little hard to compete in there  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:56):**  unless you make room for it.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:58):**  And this is the thing about mixes.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:59):**  And mixes certainly don't have to be expensive.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:03):**  You have to, sometimes you get down to ounces per acre  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:07):**  of some of seeds in a mix.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:10):**  And you have to understand that if you're  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:13):**  using sorghum Sudan grass, you've  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:15):**  got to cut that rate down to 2, 3, 4, 5 pound per acre maybe  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:18):**  if you want some of these other species to survive.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:22):**  And that's, I think, is a key when you're kind of making up  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:25):**  your mixes here.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:27):**  So I would put buckwheat in a mix.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:30):**  But you have to accommodate it.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:32):**  You have to leave room for it.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:34):**  It's a fast grower, but I'm telling you,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:36):**  sun hemp and sorghum Sudan will beat it.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:39):**  And if you have 10 to 15 pounds of each of those,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:43):**  your buckwheat's not going to do a lot in there  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:45):**  if you'll probably be out competed.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:47):**  So these are things you just have to kind of talk to someone  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:52):**  or seed provider who has experience  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:54):**  in crafting these mixes.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:55):**  It's something that you do need to have some knowledge  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:58):**  or expertise or experience in order  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:01):**  to get these mixes to be effective  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:02):**  and then not break the bank, so to speak.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:04):**  Thank you.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:06):**  We have a question that has come in here  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:08):**  from David Miller.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:09):**  Glad to see you here, David.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:10):**  I'm an organic farm.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:12):**  I have a crop of curticulae that I will be harvesting for seed.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:15):**  There's a small amount of clover, vetch,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:17):**  and some low growing weed.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:19):**  If I cut it really low, can I no till sun hemp and sorghum  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:22):**  without using it an herbicide?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:25):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:27):**  Well, I'll chime right in on that.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:29):**  I would say as soon as the straw is baled,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:31):**  if he's going to bale the straw, go plant immediately.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:34):**  Probably a few weeds here and there,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:36):**  but those sorghum Sudan sun hemp,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:38):**  they grow so fast, I think you're going to be OK.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:42):**  And if it's just sorghum Sudan and sun hemp  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:44):**  and want to keep weeds down, keep your rates a little bit  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:46):**  on the higher side.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:48):**  It's kind of a different thought, what I just mentioned.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:50):**  Because if weed control is one of your objectives here,  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:54):**  and that's why it's so important to think of what  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:57):**  your objectives are for this crop,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:59):**  because that'll determine your seeding rates and so forth.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:03):**  This is just an example where I would suggest 10 to 12 pounds  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:07):**  of sun hemp and probably 10 pounds of sorghum  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:10):**  Sudan for using those species.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:12):**  If you really want to do weed control,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:15):**  maybe up those rates even 20% higher than that.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:18):**  But that's just a foundation to jump off of.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:21):**  And if you are planting no-till, how deeply  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:23):**  would you plant those, Steve?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:24):**  About one inch.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:26):**  OK.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:27):**  A question that I've asked a lot of people  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:30):**  on the podcast, which I really enjoy asking people  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:34):**  in conversations one on one, is what is the question  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:38):**  that I should be asking?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:40):**  What's the question you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:42):**  So I would like to ask you that question from a grower's  
**[0:29:47-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:47):**  perspective.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:47):**  If you were having a conversation with a grower,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:50):**  what is the question regarding permacrofts  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:53):**  at this time of the year that the growers should  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:56):**  be thinking about?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:57):**  What are the primary considerations  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:58):**  they should be thinking about?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:59):**  Steve, you've already answered this question to some degree  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:02):**  describing how they should be thinking  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:04):**  about what crop comes next.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:06):**  But what are some of the key considerations  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:08):**  for planting permacrofts at this time  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:10):**  that growers frequently miss or that they don't think about?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:13):**  David Plinchman, why don't we begin with you?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:16):**  What's the question that growers should be asking  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:18):**  or should be thinking about?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:19):**  So the number one thing is, well, two things, actually.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:22):**  What is your budget?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:23):**  How much you want to spend on your permacrop?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:26):**  And then what are your goals that you want to achieve?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:28):**  A lot of times when I'm working with a lot of farmers,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:31):**  I have a list of about 12 different objectives  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:36):**  that a farmer can pick and choose from  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:38):**  to achieve some sort of goal.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:41):**  It's not a checkbox.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:42):**  They actually prioritize it 1 through 12.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:46):**  A lot of times, when the first thought comes into mind  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:49):**  about cover crops is erosion, which is great.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:52):**  We need to keep the soil in place,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:54):**  but there are so many other benefits  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:56):**  that a cover crop can provide to farmers.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:58):**  And until you actually start to discuss that with them,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:01):**  they really don't think too much about it.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:05):**  Thank you, David.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:06):**  Brad Hobrock, what thoughts do you have around this?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:10):**  What is the question that growers should be thinking about  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:12):**  when they think about incorporating cover crops?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:14):**  Once again, David hits the nail on the head  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:17):**  as well, what's your goal, what's your objective?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:20):**  Because simply just going out  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:21):**  and planting cover crops kind of blindly,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:24):**  I mean, can it provide some results  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:26):**  and things that, ideal things that we want to see?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:28):**  Yes, it can.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:30):**  But we have different environments.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:32):**  We have different crops.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:33):**  And so certainly next year also,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:36):**  what crops are gonna follow up with this?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:37):**  Because certainly managing those C to N ratios,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:40):**  it's very, very critical,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:41):**  especially if it is going to another grass crop,  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:44):**  say corn, wheat, et cetera.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:46):**  Brad, you may refer to managing C to N ratios.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:49):**  Why does that matter?  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:50):**  Why is it important?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:51):**  Plays a big role, especially in nitrogen availability,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:54):**  not just nitrogen availability, but that's the big one.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:58):**  Certainly if we're not addressing that properly,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:00):**  we stand to have significant nitrogen tie up  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:04):**  that will not be available to the crop next year,  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:08):**  especially that again, corn, wheat,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:10):**  and other grass of that sort.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:12):**  Thank you, Brad.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:14):**  David Chen.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:15):**  Yeah, so I think everybody's kind of nailed that one really.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:18):**  I think objective is the,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:21):**  what type of crop are you planning on planting next?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:24):**  That's obviously, I think probably the first question.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:28):**  The second question for a conventional grower  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:31):**  is what type of chemistry have you already applied?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:36):**  If you have applied chemistries  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:39):**  that have low residual activity,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:41):**  you need to read the labels,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:43):**  certain very small seeded species  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:47):**  and react adversely to that.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:51):**  So I think understanding where your chemical program  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:53):**  has been, understanding what type of crop you wanna grow,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:57):**  and then actually understanding the objective  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:00):**  of each field.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:01):**  Is there a drainage problem in a field  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:03):**  that needs to be addressed,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:05):**  with perhaps like sorghum sedan grass, as Steve mentioned,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:09):**  and that's an awesome opportunity to put sorghum sedan  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:11):**  in this early in the season as an example,  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:14):**  or are you growing corn and nitrogen  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:20):**  is your primary objective,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:22):**  then you need to be kind of shifting toward the idea  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:25):**  of some of the perhaps mixes of summer legumes  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:28):**  and winter legumes,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:29):**  and maybe some sprinkles of grasses and things,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:33):**  oats and different things like that.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:34):**  Or you're growing soybeans,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:36):**  cereal rye and soybeans  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:37):**  that kind of have a synergistic effect.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:40):**  Where cereal rye and corn,  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:41):**  I know a lot of people do it,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:42):**  but Dave's experience has not been good with that.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:45):**  So Dave does not do it because of legal pathic effects.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:49):**  That can be a problem.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:50):**  So understanding what you're going to grow,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:54):**  the chemistry you've used,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:55):**  and the objectives,  
**[0:33:58-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:58):**  whether it's nitrogen,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:58):**  whether it's mycorrhizal fungi,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:01):**  whether it's trying to build carbon levels,  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:05):**  just kind of a series of questions  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:06):**  that I think everybody's done a pretty good job  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:08):**  kind of answering.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:10):**  Thank you, David.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:11):**  Steve, save you for last.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:13):**  Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna build upon  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:14):**  what David just said with the chemistry.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:16):**  There's an easy way to figure that out  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:19):**  because with the amount of rain we have,  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:21):**  and I understand the half-life,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:23):**  the chemistry and everything,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:24):**  the best way is to take a shovel,  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:26):**  go out and gather,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:28):**  just like you'd be soil testing,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:30):**  but just go about four inches deep,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:32):**  get a couple of shovel fulls,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:33):**  put them in a five gallon bucket,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:35):**  mix it up,  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:36):**  and then go plant your cover crops  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:37):**  that you intend to plant in there  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:39):**  and see how they do in about 10 days.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:40):**  You'll know.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:41):**  That way you can be a little more confident  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:43):**  that you're not gonna have issues  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:45):**  with any herbicide effects.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:47):**  The other thing I'll just tag on with that  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:49):**  is fertility.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:50):**  Some of these fields had had nitrogen applied  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:53):**  or fertility applied.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:55):**  Who knows what's left with all the rain,  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:56):**  especially nitrogen,  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:58):**  but if you did apply nitrogen,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:00):**  you for sure wanna get a grass in there  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:02):**  to capture that and hold it.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:03):**  Again, depends on what your crop is next year,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:06):**  but even if it is corn,  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:08):**  they're using a sorghum sedan,  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:09):**  a millet,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:10):**  and some of the grass type species  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:12):**  to capture and hold that.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:14):**  Another good reason to include a brassica  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:15):**  is they're really good at that.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:17):**  So that's just a few things to add to the,  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:21):**  I guess, this discussion on this question.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:24):**  Steve, I'll ask a follow-up question  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:25):**  to our earlier question.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:26):**  We spoke a little bit about mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:28):**  and using BioCo gold,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:30):**  which is one of our products that we use a lot.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:33):**  And we've also been having a conversation about,  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:36):**  generally all of us here in the group,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:37):**  about adding legumes for nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:40):**  Is it necessary to add rhizobium inoculants  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:44):**  for these various species that might be specific,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:47):**  such as sun hemp and cowpeas, et cetera?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:49):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:50):**  Unquestionably inoculate,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:53):**  but specifically in this situation of wetness,  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:56):**  because it can actually,  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:57):**  I'm gonna say,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:58):**  kill or suppress some of these organisms out there,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:01):**  depending on a lot of things.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:03):**  But it's an inexpensive product to put in there.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:08):**  And so I'm pretty adamant.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:10):**  Yeah, go ahead and make sure you have the rhizobias on  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:13):**  for whatever species.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:15):**  Now, if you do get,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:17):**  I guess you wanna know,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:18):**  make sure you get the right strain  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:20):**  for the specific species.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:22):**  Now there's some of these companies now  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:23):**  have multiple strains in one bag or one packet, so to speak.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:28):**  Kind of covers the bases,  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:30):**  but hairy vetch and peas is the same inoculant pretty much.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:34):**  Sun hemp, be a little bit different.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:36):**  So make sure you get the right inoculant  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:39):**  on your specific species that you're intending to grow.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:42):**  Thanks, Steve.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:43):**  I'm going to shift the conversation just a little bit  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:46):**  and open a can of worms that should perhaps remain closed,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:49):**  but I think it's important for us to talk about.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:53):**  When I visit with colleagues  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:55):**  from other countries around the world,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:58):**  it's intriguing to hear perspective of growers  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:00):**  from other places.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:01):**  And one of the recurring conversations is  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:05):**  they are amazed by how effectively  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:07):**  innovation has been stifled  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:10):**  in the United States crop growing community  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:14):**  by crop insurance  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:16):**  and the effects that crop insurance has  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:18):**  on the decisions that we make.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:20):**  I think this is particularly relevant  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:22):**  to the conversation that we're having  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:23):**  about growing cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:26):**  And there are many who've said  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:28):**  that getting away from crop insurance  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:30):**  and being able to make decisions for their operation  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:35):**  completely independent of crop insurance  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:36):**  was one of the key factors  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:38):**  that has allowed them to really innovate  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:39):**  and to get to a very different place of success  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:42):**  on their operation.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:43):**  So I can't speak from experience  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:46):**  because I have never been a large scale crop grower,  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:49):**  I've never been dependent on crop insurance.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:51):**  And so to some degree,  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:53):**  I really don't know what I'm talking about,  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:54):**  but it is something that I'm certainly curious about.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:57):**  So I'd love to hear each of your perspectives.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:59):**  What is the role of crop insurance?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:00):**  What do you think the role of crop insurance should be?  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:03):**  And what do you wish were different?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:05):**  Go ahead, Steve.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:06):**  Oh, we want me to start.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:08):**  Well, first of all, I have to give the caveat,  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:10):**  I'm not a large scale grower either.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:13):**  I grow 300 acres on my farm here.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:15):**  I have chosen not to get crop insurance.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:18):**  And you could say,  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:19):**  I don't even qualify to answer this question either, John,  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:21):**  I get that.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:22):**  But I've been to Australia and I've seen down there  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:26):**  where typically a lot of farmers  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:27):**  are growing five or six different cash crops  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:29):**  in order to diversify.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:30):**  That's their crop insurance, so to speak,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:33):**  by using soil health principles.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:35):**  So I totally agree.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:36):**  I'm not sure if I would stick my neck out  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:38):**  and say we should totally eliminate crop insurance.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:41):**  But if I was in charge,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:43):**  I would dramatically pull it back and open it up.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:47):**  I would actually advocate rewarding farmers  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:50):**  who have a history of using cover crops  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:52):**  that they shouldn't have any premium.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:54):**  They shouldn't pay any premium for crop insurance  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:56):**  because their fields are more resilient.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:58):**  They'll be a little hard to prove and everything,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:00):**  but we have it.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:01):**  We actually would have the technology to do it.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:04):**  I've been through the halls of Washington, DC, USDA  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:07):**  several times addressing this issue, John.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:09):**  And it is something I am passionate about  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:12):**  and it has caused a challenge  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:14):**  to I'll say the overall soil health movement.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:17):**  I'm actually hearing people right now,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:19):**  farmers who are actually planting corn  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:21):**  knowing it's gonna be too late,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:23):**  but they say they'll make more money  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:24):**  filing a claim on corn  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:27):**  than they will just to leave it go  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:29):**  and take the prevent plant option.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:32):**  And farmers hate to do that,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:34):**  but that's kind of like we have put ourselves  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:37):**  as a country in this corner.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:39):**  And so just to sum up my opinion,  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:42):**  I would do away with most all crop insurance  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:44):**  except for catastrophic cases.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:47):**  So you open the can of worms, I just poured them out.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:51):**  All right, thank you, Steve.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:54):**  Brad Hobrock, you are a large scale commercial grower  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:58):**  and certainly this influences you a lot.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:01):**  What is your perspective?  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:02):**  I agree a lot with what Steve had mentioned,  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:06):**  but I wanna piggyback in other countries,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:09):**  Australia being one.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:12):**  They don't have crop insurance  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:13):**  and so generally they are so much farther ahead  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:17):**  of a lot of people within the United States  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:20):**  in terms of soil health and continuing to build soils.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:25):**  Often in our industry,  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:27):**  it's talked about using sustainable practices  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:30):**  and John, this is a comment I've heard  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:34):**  you make several times,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:36):**  but with continued degraded soils  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:39):**  or continued degraded practices,  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:42):**  there's nothing sustainable about that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:45):**  And we need to be true stewards of the land.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:49):**  We need to do the things that we are on here to do  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:53):**  and that's to produce healthy crops,  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:56):**  high yielding healthy crops,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:58):**  but there is too much emphasis.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:00):**  There's too many decisions that are made on crop insurance.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:05):**  Certainly it's nice to have it,  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:07):**  but I think Steve's point that those who are building soils  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:11):**  and using covers and truly involved  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:13):**  in regenerative farming practices,  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:16):**  I think there should be a huge reward for that.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:19):**  Maybe to the point that to actually have crop insurance  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:23):**  available to us, maybe everybody has to have  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:26):**  those practices involved in their farm.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:29):**  Good thoughts, Brad.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:30):**  Thank you.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:31):**  David Chance, do you use crop insurance?  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:33):**  Yeah, I do actually.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:36):**  I'm gonna take a little different take here.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:39):**  So I would say we're a mid-sized grower.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:42):**  We farm about 2,200 acres  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:44):**  and we are pretty much your classic Midwest farm.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:48):**  We grow corn, soybeans, we have hogs  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:50):**  and we also have wheat in our rotation  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:54):**  and we do not insure our wheat  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:56):**  as I'll describe here in a minute,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:57):**  but I'll take a little different approach  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:00):**  on the crop insurance.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:01):**  Crop insurance actually is something that we've paid into  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:04):**  for a number of years.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:06):**  We have the RP insurance,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:08):**  which we have the prevent plant option,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:10):**  which we took on a big majority of our corn acres this year.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:14):**  We didn't plant a single acre of corn.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:16):**  We took prevent plant on all our corn acres  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:18):**  that we intended to plant.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:20):**  It shifted some to beans,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:21):**  but it made economic sense for us to do that  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:25):**  and then also have the opportunity  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:26):**  to grow cover crops this next year,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:29):**  perhaps in order to grow corn on those acres next year  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:32):**  and perhaps lower input costs  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:34):**  by maybe growing a lot of our nitrogen.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:36):**  But what I comment on is we've paid into it  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:38):**  for over 25 years of our career  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:42):**  and we've had a couple of years  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:44):**  where we have had large claims.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:46):**  So I look at it from an economic standpoint  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:49):**  in that aspect that it is sort of a backdrop for us.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:52):**  Our operation is set up,  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:53):**  our infrastructure and our investments  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:56):**  are primarily around corn and soybean production.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:59):**  And the opportunity that crop insurance has given us  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:04):**  is that with that backdrop that we have,  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:08):**  we have the ability to market those commodities  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:11):**  on the futures market at times when they are very profitable  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:15):**  and we know that we have a safety net  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:17):**  with the crop insurance underneath us.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:20):**  That has been an intangible over that period  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:22):**  and we have paid into it the 25 years  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:24):**  we paid into it or so.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:26):**  That's been an intangible that actually has made  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:29):**  our operation a lot of profitability  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:31):**  because it's given us a confidence to market ahead  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:33):**  at prices that give us margin  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:35):**  and give us good return on equity  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:38):**  and good return on investment.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:40):**  So I'm not gonna hammer the crop insurance aspect  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:44):**  because it works for our operation.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:48):**  As far as soil health,  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:49):**  I would not disagree with the other participants  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:54):**  in the aspect that it does force us to sort of  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:57):**  a monoculture of corn and soybeans,  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:59):**  corn and soybeans, or maybe corn, corn, corn, corn  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:02):**  and maybe throw a soybean in there every once in a while.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:04):**  And that is not good for soil health  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:07):**  and it's difficult to incorporate cover crops  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:11):**  and different soil health practices into that mix  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:16):**  that are going to advance regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:21):**  We typically try to grow wheat every year  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:25):**  for what we call a rehab year.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:27):**  And that's kind of our rest year  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:29):**  where we can actually go in and grow wheat.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:32):**  We can use compost, manures, different soil amendments  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:36):**  that are necessary, address compaction,  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:39):**  and then get some of these cover crop mixes in  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:42):**  that are sort of unique in order to really kind of advance  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:48):**  our health and our soils.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:50):**  And we found that to actually be something  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:54):**  that has helped us build our soils in the system that we use  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:59):**  which is a commercial corn soybean system.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:03):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:04):**  Thank you, David, for that perspective.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:05):**  David Clingement, what thoughts do you have  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:07):**  on the crop insurance can of worms?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:10):**  It is a big can of worms.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:11):**  You know, some of the struggles have been, you know,  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:15):**  I guess in the perspectives of when is a cover crop  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:18):**  terminated as a fact of crop insurance and stuff like that,  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:21):**  that's really shot a lot of people away  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:24):**  from using cover crops, I think,  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:26):**  just because of the terminology  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:28):**  and some of the RMA handbook and everything.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:30):**  And there was a lot of confusion in it.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:32):**  I think it's cleared up quite a bit now.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:34):**  I guess I'm very hopeful for the state of Illinois.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:38):**  For the one thing that we've got going for us  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:41):**  is we'll have a $5 premium reduction on crop insurance  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:46):**  if you use a cover crop, mimicking what Iowa's done.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:49):**  And so I'm really hopeful that maybe that will help  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:54):**  to get guys to do more cover crop practices.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:57):**  But at the same time, you know,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:00):**  I don't know how much, you know, as we build our soils  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:02):**  and build our resilience to the soils and everything  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:05):**  and start to diversify out of a corn soybean pendulum,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:09):**  not really a rotation, but you know,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:12):**  if we can, if we really need that crop insurance,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:16):**  or if we just need more of that catastrophic,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:18):**  like Steve was talking, wind and hail type insurance.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:23):**  So yeah, I guess that's where I stand on that.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:25):**  Thank you, David.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:26):**  There are a few questions that I think  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:28):**  would be of wide-scale interest.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:30):**  One of them is we spoke about identifying the objectives  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:34):**  of the cover crops that we're growing.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:36):**  If an objective is to shift the soil's microbial population  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:41):**  from being bacterially dominant to being fungally dominant,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:45):**  what are some cover crop species that would really help  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:48):**  to accelerate that shift and drive that?  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:50):**  And if you have any thoughts or insights on that?  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:53):**  When you go to, I would say higher lignified covers  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:58):**  that are a little more complex versus higher sugar content,  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:03):**  higher sugar content covers, legumes, things of that nature,  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:07):**  tend to be digested pretty quickly  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:10):**  and are somewhat more bacterially dominated.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:13):**  And Steve had talked about sorghum, sudangrass,  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:17):**  and even serorai that's left to mature  
**[0:47:20-0:47:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:20):**  or things of that nature that have a higher carbon  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:24):**  to nitrogen ratio and are a little more lignified  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:27):**  and a little higher complex.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:29):**  They typically seem to be a little better food sources  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:33):**  for fungal populations.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:35):**  But however, I'll qualify that they also need  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:40):**  some more bacterially dominated covers in there  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:43):**  that are quickly digested to build bacterial populations  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:50):**  so that the fungal populations will actually piggyback  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:54):**  on bacterial populations as long as they have a food source,  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:59):**  a highly lignified food source  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:01):**  to basically feed on.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:05):**  So in essence, David, what you're describing is  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:07):**  to grow a cover crops that have very broad carbon  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:09):**  and nitrogen ratios, lower levels of protein  
**[0:48:11-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:11):**  and have a lot of carbon.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:13):**  I would agree with that.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:15):**  There is a very good question that has come up.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:17):**  How do you facilitate germination of cover crops  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:20):**  in hot weather and dry soil when irrigation is limited?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:24):**  So this is a very real concern  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:26):**  because I know some parts of the country  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:28):**  that where this pendulum has already swung  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:30):**  from one extreme this spring to the other extreme right now  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:32):**  where soils were already very dry and very warm.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:35):**  So what answers would you have for that?  
**[0:48:38-0:48:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:38):**  Brad Hobrock, do you have any thoughts or insights  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:40):**  on how to manage that?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:41):**  Well, number one, if you have very, very adverse  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:44):**  soil conditions, i.e. very, very hot, very dry,  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:48):**  from a financial perspective,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:50):**  if we're not likely to get them germinated  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:52):**  because of soil conditions are not ideal,  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:55):**  then should we be spending any money on it.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:57):**  In some of those situations,  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:59):**  and that could even be like a dry land sand here today  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:01):**  in Central Illinois, here in the Illinois River Valley.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:05):**  But simply if it doesn't make sense,  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:09):**  is it worth spending money on it?  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:10):**  It's probably not.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:12):**  Mitigating those things outside of looking  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:15):**  at weather forecasts, there's not a lot that can be done.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:19):**  Thanks, Brad.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:21):**  Pretty thorough and pretty answered.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:23):**  It's not the answer we would like to hear,  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:25):**  but it is the real answer, absolutely.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:27):**  David Chance, do you have any thoughts to add to that?  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:30):**  No, I totally agree with him.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:33):**  If you're in an adverse situation, there's not moisture,  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:36):**  and it's difficult to establish them like that.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:40):**  I totally agree.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:41):**  I mean, you need to either wait to moisture  
**[0:49:43-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:43):**  or wait to get them established  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:46):**  because you'll be disappointed if you don't get response.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:50):**  I guess it's a question of how severe the problem is.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:52):**  If you have severe challenges with not having enough  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:54):**  moisture, if they're severe enough,  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:56):**  it's completely impractical.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:59):**  So let me add to that real quick, John.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:02):**  Even if you get germination to occur,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:05):**  roots still need moisture in the soil to grow.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:08):**  And if we don't have enough soil moisture  
**[0:50:10-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:10):**  for that to happen, then once again,  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:12):**  there's just no sense in spending that money.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:14):**  Absolutely, Brad, thank you.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:16):**  We have one final question that we'll address here.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:19):**  Do we have any thoughts on cover crop species  
**[0:50:21-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:21):**  for soils that have been damaged from multiple years  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:24):**  of herbicide, tillage, chemical fertilizer?  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:27):**  What cover crops could we use that might speed up  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:30):**  the bioremediation process of any residues  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:34):**  that might still remain in that soil profile?  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:37):**  Any thoughts on cover crops that might be able  
**[0:50:39-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:39):**  to benefit that in particular,  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:40):**  if that is a specific objective?  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:43):**  The first thought that comes to my mind is root sticks.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:46):**  Dirt.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:47):**  So, you know, the annual rye grass species,  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:49):**  they're seeing clover, crimson clover,  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:52):**  the lance of clover can really, really help  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:55):**  to remediate those types of situations.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:58):**  Especially in a vineyard, having something  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:00):**  that's pollinator clover in there  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:02):**  can really be beneficial there.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:04):**  David, you just used a phrase that I'm unfamiliar with.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:06):**  You used the phrase root stick soil.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:09):**  What are you describing by that?  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:10):**  What do you mean?  
**[0:51:11-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:11):**  So, soils weren't formed by a plow.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:14):**  They evolved by, you know, plants, roots interaction,  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:18):**  microbial interaction, and grazers going across  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:21):**  much of the earth at the same time.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:23):**  So, the more roots that we can have out there,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:27):**  more fibrous roots, you know,  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:29):**  a lot of people think about radishes  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:31):**  to help alleviate their compaction issues  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:34):**  where actually an annual rye grass  
**[0:51:36-0:51:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:36):**  with a whole lot of root mass  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:38):**  will fix that compaction issue a lot quicker.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:42):**  So, it's just a term I heard here about a month ago  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:45):**  of roots fix dirt and it just makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:49):**  I think maybe Rick Hammey says that.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:52):**  Got it.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:53):**  All right, well, we are coming up to the end of the hour.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:55):**  Do any of you have any final thoughts  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:57):**  you would like to add to the conversation,  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:59):**  things that we haven't talked about,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:00):**  questions that I haven't asked,  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:01):**  anything else that is important to discuss that we've missed?  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:04):**  John, if I can real quick.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:05):**  You know, we talked a little bit about bailing  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:07):**  some of these forages.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:08):**  We really gotta be cautious on the nitrate levels on that,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:12):**  nitrate and persic acid,  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:14):**  but we're either being grazed or being bailed off  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:18):**  to make sure we're not setting ourselves up  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:20):**  for a very catastrophic event with our livestock as well.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:24):**  Thank you, David.

**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:30):**  I know that many growers find this information  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:33):**  to be very valuable.

**[0:52:57-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:57):**  because we believe that knowledge and information  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:53:00):**  is the foundation of successful regenerative systems.

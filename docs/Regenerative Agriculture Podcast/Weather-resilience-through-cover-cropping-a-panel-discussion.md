### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2019-51-17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:47):**  agriculture systems become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which all other growing systems  are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:28):**  of a live panel conversation I had  with a group of friends and growers  from across the Midwest,  where we spoke about how to use cover crops  in fields where planting has been delayed  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:39):**  and we haven't been able to get crops  into the ground in time.  So we've talked a lot about how to use cover crops  in anticipation of next year's crop  and to be able to regenerate soil health  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:04:51):**  and reduce weed pressure, safeguard against erosion,  and improve our overall farming system.  I really enjoyed hosting the panel.  We had great conversations with some very key points  that I think you will all find interesting.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:06):**  I hope you find the information useful and actionable.  All right, well, welcome everyone.  Today we have a bit of a slightly different format.  I've invited several excellent growers and farmers  who I've had the privilege of working with  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:20):**  over the last couple of years to this conversation as well.  And so we have Steve Groff, cover crop coach,  the infamous pioneer who was using cover crops  before there were very many cover crops  being used in the agriculture space.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:33):**  Glad to have you, Steve.  We have David Clineshmit,  who's an agronomist and grower from Illinois,  and Brad Hobrock, also from Illinois, and then David Chance.  David Chance, if I recall, correct this from Indiana.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:45):**  Am I right about that, David?  That's correct, that's correct.  Lebanon, Indiana.  All right, so I want to thank all of you  for joining the conversation discussion today  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:05:57):**  and wanted to just have a open conversation.  In our consulting work, we're having many interactions  with growers who are puzzled and perhaps unfamiliar  with the opportunities that they have in the seasons,  looking at the latest USDA report.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:15):**  At this moment, we still have a significant number  of unplanted acres, particularly here in the state of Ohio.  As of the beginning of this week's report,  we've had about 80% of corn acres planted  and about 65% of soybean acres planted.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:30):**  And considering this is the first week in July,  certainly pushing up against the window  of what opportunities remain for the season.  And so I often am surprised by the number of growers  who are unfamiliar with the opportunities that they have  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:06:45):**  and what can still be done at this point in the year.  So I wanted to have a conversation together  with us as a group to share some thoughts and ideas about what  the possibilities are.  So Steve, perhaps I'll go to you first.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:00):**  There is this idea that if it's too late to plant corn  and coming the window is rapidly closing on planting beans,  then that's it.  There's not a lot of opportunities  left for us in the year.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:12):**  And the only thing that is left when  there's a common perception that I've come across  that planting cover crops is a significant expense.  We have limited economic resources.  And that's not something we should invest in such a  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:25):**  challenge and troubled year.  How would you respond to that?  I would respond by saying this is a golden opportunity  to make lemonade out of lemons.  So if you don't get your cash crop in  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:37):**  and you've always wanted to try cover crops,  you have no excuse not to try cover crops.  The thing of it is we have so many options.  Steve, I can't afford it.  No, you can't afford it.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:07:50):**  Well, yeah, you know what?  The thing about it is, though, we  have these options of multiple species and everything.  We can actually create and make nitrogen for next year.  In our corn crop, I have seen time and time again,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:06):**  we're in a prevent plant situation  or in a similar opportunity, like after wheat,  which is kind of the same kind of a planting window here,  that farmers have had to use little to no nitrogen  the following year for their corn.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:20):**  So that should get your attention, John,  because nitrogen is an expense.  So that would be my first comment to that.  But what is the value of increasing your soil's health,  increasing the agri-stability, all these many things  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:34):**  that cover crops can give for you?  So I would say, in my experience,  I'm talking to many, many farmers who  have said that this is a situation where really it got  them into cover crops, where they were actually  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:08:47):**  tested and tried them, and they were able to see the benefits.  I have heard of situations where farmers had wet spots that  dried out, they planted cover crops,  and they said from then on, they saw a difference  in their fields where those cover crops were planted.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:06):**  Thank you, Steve.  David Chance, what experience have you  had with cover crops in similar situations,  and what advice do you give to growers when you speak  to them in this situation?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:14):**  That's a good point.  I guess we've been working with cover crops here on our farm  since 2006, and have tried a lot of different types of things.  And I'll kind of echo what Steve had said as well,  in terms of this is kind of an opportunity  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:31):**  to actually kind of follow the ground  and to grow a diverse species cover crop,  and break some of the normal corn-soybean rotations  that we have, and also able to probably grow  a significant amount of our nitrogen for next year  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:09:50):**  as well, and basically add liquid carbons  of different taste to the microbes,  and really kind of generate, kind of jumpstart  a microbial system that will have lasting benefit.  I see it as a very, very large opportunity,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:09):**  and there's a lot of different species  and a lot of different combinations that can be used.  And some of them can be just as simple as just oats and clover.  It doesn't have to be 16 or 20 species.  It can be what you want to make it,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:28):**  but it can be very beneficial, and it really  is a golden opportunity.  In scripture, if you look at the Old Testament,  it talks about a seven-year rest.  And we've not really had, in my career,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:43):**  or probably the history of the United States,  a seven-year rest on our lands.  And looking at this little bigger picture,  I feel like God's maybe giving us this opportunity  to have a rest that our land needs,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:10:59):**  and cover crops can play into this rest very, very well.  Well, if you continue the biblical narrative,  when the nation of Israel did not provide their land  with the rest voluntarily, it was forced upon them.  Yes, it was, rather brutally.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:19):**  Yeah.  One of the questions that comes to mind for me,  there's been a recent announcement  that the USDA is permitting the cropping of cover crops  and the harvesting of cover crops in September 1st instead  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:34):**  of November, as has historically been the case.  And this raises a question mark about the role of crop  insurance and USDA in influencing decision making,  et cetera.  But one of the questions that I would have for you as a group,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:11:50):**  and perhaps Brad will go to you next  if you have any comments on this question,  is how much of an influence should the ability  to harvest your cover crops make on your cover crop decisions  and what you decide to do on your farm?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:08):**  At this point in time, especially due to cattle  producers who need the hay for feeding,  it does create an opportunity for an additional income source  due to the USDA changing that date to September 1st.  So it definitely plays a big role, potentially,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:28):**  for I know a lot of people in central Illinois  and probably the Corn Belt.  Brad, with the availability of additional income opportunity,  I guess the question that is in my mind  is, how does that opportunity compare with the opportunity  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:42):**  to just grow a cover crop and sequester nitrogen  for next year's crop, as Steve was describing?  Can you do both of those at the same time?  Is it an either or discussion?  How do you make those decisions and choices?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:12:53):**  Can it be done at the same time?  Yes, it can.  I think there's an opportunity also  that having discussions with some of the local cattle  producers to see what their needs are.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:07):**  Certainly not everybody is going to look at that avenue.  Still, in my opinion, the greatest benefit  behind cover crops is improving active carbon levels  in the soil.  And we've proven that that also is a very, very close  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:22):**  correlation to yields the following year as well.  Thanks, Brad.  David Plinschmidt, we haven't heard your voice yet.  The conversations you've been having with growers  that you work with, what are you hearing from the countryside  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:38):**  in terms of growers' interest in cover crops?  And what are the major reservations and question  marks that they have?  So this year reminds me a lot of 2012, really,  with our drought year.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:13:49):**  It gave us an opportunity to plant cover crops then.  And it's kind of echoing what Steve and David said.  It's given us a golden opportunity  to go ahead and seed some things we typically wanted.  A couple of the things that I hear a lot of, though,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:04):**  is guys are just looking at cereal rye and maybe radishes  or something.  And we kind of got to understand the difference  between cool season and warm season, grasses and legumes,  and when they should be planted for the best success.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:22):**  So that's probably the biggest concerns I hear.  And then, of course, if a guy had cut down  any fertilizer or any residual herbicide applications  on those fields and looking to see what species could then  be planted and trying to make a plan for that,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:42):**  also managing the carbon and the nitrogen for that following  crop year as well.  Thanks, David.  That leads me to a question that I have for each of you.  Conversations that I have many growers  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:14:53):**  are asking the question, particularly  those who don't have a history with growing cover crops,  is what should I choose?  This is now the beginning of July.  What are the cover crops that I can choose  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:05):**  that are going to make the biggest difference for me?  Let me see.  Let's start with David's chance.  David, you mentioned that it can be something  as simple as oats and clover.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:15):**  But the grower has an opportunity  to put in something to really optimize  what is happening in his soil.  What would your general recommendations be?  Where would you begin?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:24):**  It's kind of another good question.  I actually had a friend this morning  that had a situation where he was looking at the nitrogen  production and looking at his equipment  that he has to actually plant cover crops,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:37):**  15-inch row planter.  This particular event, probably the biggest bang for his buck  would be using Austrian winter peas,  inoculated probably in 15-inch rows planted RTK.  So that he would have the option to plant corn  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:15:57):**  in between those next year and have a nitrogen source.  It would probably be a very big bang for his buck,  however, a single specie.  So that's one way to look at it.  A lot of times, the biggest bang for the buck,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:11):**  in my opinion, in my experience, has  been mixing basically a grass, a good grass specie,  with a good legume specie, with a good brass specie,  and a good broadleaf specie that kind of get along  with each other.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:27):**  Don't shade each other out, but offer those different  synergies, you might say.  It can be as simple as four things together,  five things together.  If somebody is really hesitant on trying cover crops,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:16:44):**  the oats, radish, medium red clover,  valanza clover, something like that,  can be fairly economical and still offer a multitude  of species that are going to break those rotations  and really start turning the microbiome and that soil on,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:01):**  which is really, at the end of the day, what we're after doing.  We're after covering the soil, anchoring it down,  growing roots, putting that liquid carbon in there  for those microbes, kind of accomplish  a multitude of those things.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:14):**  So it kind of depends on the situation.  But I do generally like to mix those four types of species.  Good grass, for instance, oats.  We'll use a lot of oats in our mixes,  probably along with buckwheat.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:27):**  Buckwheat's a really nice broadleaf  that seems to scavenge a really nicely.  We've done some flax as a broadleaf.  We like the cilia, but it's so darn expensive,  it becomes a little bit difficult to manage  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:41):**  on a cost perspective.  And then legumes, we'll work with peas, clovers, vetches.  And I'm not as big on brassicas anymore as I used to be.  I still like radishes.  I still like turnips, kale, things of that nature.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:17:57):**  But I just kind of sprinkle those in anymore.  I find more value in the grasses, legumes,  and some of the broadleafs.  Don't know if that answers your question,  but that's typically how I'd respond.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:14):**  That's a great answer.  Thank you, David.  And I'd like to go to Brad Hobrock.  Brad, what general recommendations  would you make to growers who are just starting out  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:24):**  and have questions about how to begin with cover crops?  David Chance really hit the nail on my head in a lot of aspects.  But with that said, I also do believe  that we can start fairly simple.  He had also mentioned kind of oak-clover mixture.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:40):**  Fairly simple, fairly economical mixture there.  But also, if there is a possibility still  for maybe bailing some of this for some local cattle  producers, I think that's a discussion  that you need to have also with some of those folks  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:18:56):**  to make sure that you are planting  what they may want or need.  Very good thought.  Thanks, Brad.  Brad, would you consider, would it be appropriate  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:05):**  or would there be an appropriate trade-off  to consider planting a crop that matures quickly  as a forage crop, such as, say, oats, for example?  Although it might be getting late for those.  But still, producing a forage crop  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:17):**  before the September 1 deadline, is that something that  would still be a viable option?  In certain areas, I think so.  But if you look here in central Illinois,  it's raining here again right now.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:29):**  We had another 2 and 1 half to 3 inches here a couple of days  ago.  And so there are still a lot of fields  that have water standing on them as well.  And so due to current soil conditions,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:43):**  that actually might be a limiting factor in that respect.  Got it.  Thanks, Brad.  Steve Groff, you look at a lot of cover crop opportunities  and challenges and strange situations all over the world.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:19:58):**  Where would you make a recommendation  to begin with cover crop planting?  Yeah, well, first of all, I would  say start thinking about what do you intend  to plant next year in that field.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:08):**  That can help set up the type of species you might want to use.  The thing, too, that I want to mention  is that there's hardly anything better than sorghum savangrass  to be planted now.  It grows very well in the heat of summer.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:22):**  And it puts carbon in the soil.  But there's one thing that we rarely hear about.  These soils, a lot of them have been saturated.  And when they do dry out, which we don't know yet.  Some of them, we don't know when that's going to be.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:36):**  The mycorrhizae population has been suppressed because  of extreme wet situation.  And that's something that people don't think about.  I ran into this in some previous wet periods of time  where you have something like sorghum sudan  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:20:50):**  can really help rejuvenate that mycorrhizal population that's  going to help us.  I think that's some of the benefits  that we haven't really focused in on.  So I'll just say sorghum sudan is what you want to build it on.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:01):**  And then some legumes would be sun hemp and cowpeas.  Those are the two, seems to be the cream  of the crop for the legumes.  And then throwing a brass skin there like a radish now  is kind of the common tactic that's being used.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:16):**  The nice thing about those fast-growing summer  legumes, sun hemp, cowpeas, and or sorghum savangrass  is the grass.  They grow very quickly.  The radishes run through the canopy, don't do much.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:26):**  And then when we have that first killing frost in the fall,  then that opens up the canopy.  The radish then starts doing its job.  It helps pick up the nitrogen that the legumes made,  carries it over to the following season.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:40):**  So that's a nice three-way mix.  Of course, there's another dozen or two dozen other species  you can mix in there.  So I would, again, I appreciate the theme here.  Keep it simple.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:21:50):**  But if you're one who is down the road  or you feel confident that someone's  going to give you a good mix, this  is an opportunity to plant that 12-way mix.  Nothing else you can brag to your neighbors  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:02):**  how many species you had.  But still, I think there is some validity to it  if it's created correctly.  So that's just some of my comments  to build on what was previously stated.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:11):**  Great comments, Steve.  And we've actually observed tremendous responses  when planting cover crops.  And in this situation, when you have preventive planting  due to flooding and inoculating those cover crop  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:24):**  seeds with mycorrhizal fungi.  We have a lot of growers who use bio coke gold for that.  And the results are really substantial.  Because as you said, the soils are really  suppressed in this situation.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:36):**  One of the things that I haven't heard at all,  and just putting it out there as a question mark,  should we consider using summer annuals that  have a relatively short lifespan, such as buckwheat?  Do they fit into cover crops at this time of the year at all?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:22:52):**  And I'll just put that out there for anyone who wants to answer.  Absolutely.  Yes, absolutely.  Buckwheat and sunflowers.  Why sunflowers, David?  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:03):**  Well, so I kind of look at what weeds really  thrive in our environment.  And we have a lot of pigweeds.  And so if you really look at the root structure of a pigweed  and the root structure of a sunflower,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:13):**  they almost mimic each other.  But not only that, but it's kind of a taproot there as well.  But very, very good pollinator to attract  in some of our beneficial predatory insects as well.  It also helps to bring zinc and even calcium  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:32):**  available in that soil profile.  And then by next spring, when you dig up  around those roots, you'll find a tremendous amount  of earthworms around there.  David, Chance, you also responded pretty hard  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:23:45):**  to leave that buckwheat is a really great idea.  What would be reasons you would choose buckwheat?  And what would be reasons that you would not choose buckwheat?  You know, this early in the season, it will go to seed.  It seeds very quickly, and flowers, it seeds very quickly.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:00):**  And will reseed itself.  And typically in the spring, in the following spring,  it will germinate and probably has the potential to be a weed.  We are a conventional grower.  So we do have the opportunity to chemically terminate  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:18):**  most of our cover crops.  So that has not been an issue with us.  I actually kind of like the idea of that reseeding  and kind of getting started and then terminating it  prior to the next crop.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:33):**  But we have had buckwheat.  There is obviously tremendous insect attraction.  Bees, floss, they're just different things.  And I like some of these flowering things,  typically after wheat.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:24:45):**  And in the pre-bit situation, it's similar to after wheat.  We can put some things like buckwheat or flax or phacilia  and sunn hemp that actually flower  at different kind of times.  And it really is attractive to all these beneficial insects.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:01):**  And where we've had buckwheat, where  we have done pretty intensive soil testing  without added minerals through purchase,  we have seen phosphorus levels and potassium levels  actually increase significantly on our soil testing.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:17):**  So I like buckwheat.  It's a reasonable price.  It's easy to put in.  Kind of look at the plant.  It's kind of a puny-looking plant.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:25):**  You dig the roots up.  They're not super impressive.  But it's one of those things that  must be the sugars that it produces through those roots.  It must be magic to those microbes.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:35):**  Yeah.  In my personal observation, the two cover crops  which loosen soil and increase soil  aggregation really substantially are oats and buckwheat.  They're just very difficult to match in what they do.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:25:48):**  And also, they have, as you described, both of those crops  have a substantial impact on increasing phosphorus  availability.  And to the comment about weeds, I always hear this comment  that, oh, buckwheat can become a weed.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:03):**  And my response to that is, if you can't control buckwheat  as a weed, then you really can't control anything else either.  Because even if you're not using herbicides,  if you're an organic grower and you're doing cultivation,  buckwheat is so easy to cultivate out.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:17):**  If you have a problem with buckwheat,  you really have a problem.  You have a bigger problem.  Steve, do you have any thoughts or input on buckwheat?  Yeah.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:26):**  I would say, and I like buckwheat  for all the reasons mentioned, but again,  what is your next crop going to be?  And when is it going to be?  Let's just theoretically say you might go to wheat.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:39):**  Not many people do, but you might go to wheat.  So then that's going to be probably in October.  So you don't have a lot of time there to buckwheat.  It'd be very appropriate to do that.  The problem with buckwheat when you use sorghum  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:50):**  Sudan and sun hemp and even cowpeas  is it kind of almost passes the grows.  It's a little hard to compete in there  unless you make room for it.  And this is the thing about mixes.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:26:59):**  And mixes certainly don't have to be expensive.  You have to, sometimes you get down to ounces per acre  of some of seeds in a mix.  And you have to understand that if you're  using sorghum Sudan grass, you've  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:15):**  got to cut that rate down to 2, 3, 4, 5 pound per acre maybe  if you want some of these other species to survive.  And that's, I think, is a key when you're kind of making up  your mixes here.  So I would put buckwheat in a mix.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:30):**  But you have to accommodate it.  You have to leave room for it.  It's a fast grower, but I'm telling you,  sun hemp and sorghum Sudan will beat it.  And if you have 10 to 15 pounds of each of those,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:43):**  your buckwheat's not going to do a lot in there  if you'll probably be out competed.  So these are things you just have to kind of talk to someone  or seed provider who has experience  in crafting these mixes.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:27:55):**  It's something that you do need to have some knowledge  or expertise or experience in order  to get these mixes to be effective  and then not break the bank, so to speak.  Thank you.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:06):**  We have a question that has come in here  from David Miller.  Glad to see you here, David.  I'm an organic farm.  I have a crop of curticulae that I will be harvesting for seed.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:15):**  There's a small amount of clover, vetch,  and some low growing weed.  If I cut it really low, can I no till sun hemp and sorghum  without using it an herbicide?  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:27):**  Well, I'll chime right in on that.  I would say as soon as the straw is baled,  if he's going to bale the straw, go plant immediately.  Probably a few weeds here and there,  but those sorghum Sudan sun hemp,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:38):**  they grow so fast, I think you're going to be OK.  And if it's just sorghum Sudan and sun hemp  and want to keep weeds down, keep your rates a little bit  on the higher side.  It's kind of a different thought, what I just mentioned.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:28:50):**  Because if weed control is one of your objectives here,  and that's why it's so important to think of what  your objectives are for this crop,  because that'll determine your seeding rates and so forth.  This is just an example where I would suggest 10 to 12 pounds  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:07):**  of sun hemp and probably 10 pounds of sorghum  Sudan for using those species.  If you really want to do weed control,  maybe up those rates even 20% higher than that.  But that's just a foundation to jump off of.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:21):**  And if you are planting no-till, how deeply  would you plant those, Steve?  About one inch.  OK.  A question that I've asked a lot of people  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:30):**  on the podcast, which I really enjoy asking people  in conversations one on one, is what is the question  that I should be asking?  What's the question you wish I would have asked?  So I would like to ask you that question from a grower's  
**[0:29:47-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:47):**  perspective.  If you were having a conversation with a grower,  what is the question regarding permacrofts  at this time of the year that the growers should  be thinking about?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:29:57):**  What are the primary considerations  they should be thinking about?  Steve, you've already answered this question to some degree  describing how they should be thinking  about what crop comes next.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:06):**  But what are some of the key considerations  for planting permacrofts at this time  that growers frequently miss or that they don't think about?  David Plinchman, why don't we begin with you?  What's the question that growers should be asking  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:18):**  or should be thinking about?  So the number one thing is, well, two things, actually.  What is your budget?  How much you want to spend on your permacrop?  And then what are your goals that you want to achieve?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:28):**  A lot of times when I'm working with a lot of farmers,  I have a list of about 12 different objectives  that a farmer can pick and choose from  to achieve some sort of goal.  It's not a checkbox.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:42):**  They actually prioritize it 1 through 12.  A lot of times, when the first thought comes into mind  about cover crops is erosion, which is great.  We need to keep the soil in place,  but there are so many other benefits  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:30:56):**  that a cover crop can provide to farmers.  And until you actually start to discuss that with them,  they really don't think too much about it.  Thank you, David.  Brad Hobrock, what thoughts do you have around this?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:10):**  What is the question that growers should be thinking about  when they think about incorporating cover crops?  Once again, David hits the nail on the head  as well, what's your goal, what's your objective?  Because simply just going out  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:21):**  and planting cover crops kind of blindly,  I mean, can it provide some results  and things that, ideal things that we want to see?  Yes, it can.  But we have different environments.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:32):**  We have different crops.  And so certainly next year also,  what crops are gonna follow up with this?  Because certainly managing those C to N ratios,  it's very, very critical,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:41):**  especially if it is going to another grass crop,  say corn, wheat, et cetera.  Brad, you may refer to managing C to N ratios.  Why does that matter?  Why is it important?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:31:51):**  Plays a big role, especially in nitrogen availability,  not just nitrogen availability, but that's the big one.  Certainly if we're not addressing that properly,  we stand to have significant nitrogen tie up  that will not be available to the crop next year,  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:08):**  especially that again, corn, wheat,  and other grass of that sort.  Thank you, Brad.  David Chen.  Yeah, so I think everybody's kind of nailed that one really.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:18):**  I think objective is the,  what type of crop are you planning on planting next?  That's obviously, I think probably the first question.  The second question for a conventional grower  is what type of chemistry have you already applied?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:36):**  If you have applied chemistries  that have low residual activity,  you need to read the labels,  certain very small seeded species  and react adversely to that.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:32:51):**  So I think understanding where your chemical program  has been, understanding what type of crop you wanna grow,  and then actually understanding the objective  of each field.  Is there a drainage problem in a field  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:03):**  that needs to be addressed,  with perhaps like sorghum sedan grass, as Steve mentioned,  and that's an awesome opportunity to put sorghum sedan  in this early in the season as an example,  or are you growing corn and nitrogen  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:20):**  is your primary objective,  then you need to be kind of shifting toward the idea  of some of the perhaps mixes of summer legumes  and winter legumes,  and maybe some sprinkles of grasses and things,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:33):**  oats and different things like that.  Or you're growing soybeans,  cereal rye and soybeans  that kind of have a synergistic effect.  Where cereal rye and corn,  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:41):**  I know a lot of people do it,  but Dave's experience has not been good with that.  So Dave does not do it because of legal pathic effects.  That can be a problem.  So understanding what you're going to grow,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:33:54):**  the chemistry you've used,  and the objectives,  whether it's nitrogen,  whether it's mycorrhizal fungi,  whether it's trying to build carbon levels,  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:05):**  just kind of a series of questions  that I think everybody's done a pretty good job  kind of answering.  Thank you, David.  Steve, save you for last.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:13):**  Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna build upon  what David just said with the chemistry.  There's an easy way to figure that out  because with the amount of rain we have,  and I understand the half-life,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:23):**  the chemistry and everything,  the best way is to take a shovel,  go out and gather,  just like you'd be soil testing,  but just go about four inches deep,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:32):**  get a couple of shovel fulls,  put them in a five gallon bucket,  mix it up,  and then go plant your cover crops  that you intend to plant in there  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:39):**  and see how they do in about 10 days.  You'll know.  That way you can be a little more confident  that you're not gonna have issues  with any herbicide effects.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:47):**  The other thing I'll just tag on with that  is fertility.  Some of these fields had had nitrogen applied  or fertility applied.  Who knows what's left with all the rain,  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:34:56):**  especially nitrogen,  but if you did apply nitrogen,  you for sure wanna get a grass in there  to capture that and hold it.  Again, depends on what your crop is next year,  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:06):**  but even if it is corn,  they're using a sorghum sedan,  a millet,  and some of the grass type species  to capture and hold that.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:14):**  Another good reason to include a brassica  is they're really good at that.  So that's just a few things to add to the,  I guess, this discussion on this question.  Steve, I'll ask a follow-up question  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:25):**  to our earlier question.  We spoke a little bit about mycorrhizal fungi  and using BioCo gold,  which is one of our products that we use a lot.  And we've also been having a conversation about,  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:36):**  generally all of us here in the group,  about adding legumes for nitrogen fixation.  Is it necessary to add rhizobium inoculants  for these various species that might be specific,  such as sun hemp and cowpeas, et cetera?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:49):**  Oh, absolutely.  Unquestionably inoculate,  but specifically in this situation of wetness,  because it can actually,  I'm gonna say,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:35:58):**  kill or suppress some of these organisms out there,  depending on a lot of things.  But it's an inexpensive product to put in there.  And so I'm pretty adamant.  Yeah, go ahead and make sure you have the rhizobias on  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:13):**  for whatever species.  Now, if you do get,  I guess you wanna know,  make sure you get the right strain  for the specific species.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:22):**  Now there's some of these companies now  have multiple strains in one bag or one packet, so to speak.  Kind of covers the bases,  but hairy vetch and peas is the same inoculant pretty much.  Sun hemp, be a little bit different.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:36):**  So make sure you get the right inoculant  on your specific species that you're intending to grow.  Thanks, Steve.  I'm going to shift the conversation just a little bit  and open a can of worms that should perhaps remain closed,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:36:49):**  but I think it's important for us to talk about.  When I visit with colleagues  from other countries around the world,  it's intriguing to hear perspective of growers  from other places.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:01):**  And one of the recurring conversations is  they are amazed by how effectively  innovation has been stifled  in the United States crop growing community  by crop insurance  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:16):**  and the effects that crop insurance has  on the decisions that we make.  I think this is particularly relevant  to the conversation that we're having  about growing cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:26):**  And there are many who've said  that getting away from crop insurance  and being able to make decisions for their operation  completely independent of crop insurance  was one of the key factors  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:38):**  that has allowed them to really innovate  and to get to a very different place of success  on their operation.  So I can't speak from experience  because I have never been a large scale crop grower,  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:49):**  I've never been dependent on crop insurance.  And so to some degree,  I really don't know what I'm talking about,  but it is something that I'm certainly curious about.  So I'd love to hear each of your perspectives.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:37:59):**  What is the role of crop insurance?  What do you think the role of crop insurance should be?  And what do you wish were different?  Go ahead, Steve.  Oh, we want me to start.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:07):**  Okay.  Well, first of all, I have to give the caveat,  I'm not a large scale grower either.  I grow 300 acres on my farm here.  I have chosen not to get crop insurance.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:18):**  And you could say,  I don't even qualify to answer this question either, John,  I get that.  But I've been to Australia and I've seen down there  where typically a lot of farmers  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:27):**  are growing five or six different cash crops  in order to diversify.  That's their crop insurance, so to speak,  by using soil health principles.  So I totally agree.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:36):**  I'm not sure if I would stick my neck out  and say we should totally eliminate crop insurance.  But if I was in charge,  I would dramatically pull it back and open it up.  I would actually advocate rewarding farmers  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:38:50):**  who have a history of using cover crops  that they shouldn't have any premium.  They shouldn't pay any premium for crop insurance  because their fields are more resilient.  They'll be a little hard to prove and everything,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:00):**  but we have it.  We actually would have the technology to do it.  I've been through the halls of Washington, DC, USDA  several times addressing this issue, John.  And it is something I am passionate about  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:12):**  and it has caused a challenge  to I'll say the overall soil health movement.  I'm actually hearing people right now,  farmers who are actually planting corn  knowing it's gonna be too late,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:23):**  but they say they'll make more money  filing a claim on corn  than they will just to leave it go  and take the prevent plant option.  And farmers hate to do that,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:34):**  but that's kind of like we have put ourselves  as a country in this corner.  And so just to sum up my opinion,  I would do away with most all crop insurance  except for catastrophic cases.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:39:47):**  So you open the can of worms, I just poured them out.  All right, thank you, Steve.  Brad Hobrock, you are a large scale commercial grower  and certainly this influences you a lot.  What is your perspective?  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:02):**  I agree a lot with what Steve had mentioned,  but I wanna piggyback in other countries,  Australia being one.  They don't have crop insurance  and so generally they are so much farther ahead  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:17):**  of a lot of people within the United States  in terms of soil health and continuing to build soils.  Often in our industry,  it's talked about using sustainable practices  and John, this is a comment I've heard  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:34):**  you make several times,  but with continued degraded soils  or continued degraded practices,  there's nothing sustainable about that.  And we need to be true stewards of the land.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:40:49):**  We need to do the things that we are on here to do  and that's to produce healthy crops,  high yielding healthy crops,  but there is too much emphasis.  There's too many decisions that are made on crop insurance.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:05):**  Certainly it's nice to have it,  but I think Steve's point that those who are building soils  and using covers and truly involved  in regenerative farming practices,  I think there should be a huge reward for that.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:19):**  Maybe to the point that to actually have crop insurance  available to us, maybe everybody has to have  those practices involved in their farm.  Good thoughts, Brad.  Thank you.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:31):**  David Chance, do you use crop insurance?  Yeah, I do actually.  I'm gonna take a little different take here.  So I would say we're a mid-sized grower.  We farm about 2,200 acres  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:44):**  and we are pretty much your classic Midwest farm.  We grow corn, soybeans, we have hogs  and we also have wheat in our rotation  and we do not insure our wheat  as I'll describe here in a minute,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:41:57):**  but I'll take a little different approach  on the crop insurance.  Crop insurance actually is something that we've paid into  for a number of years.  We have the RP insurance,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:08):**  which we have the prevent plant option,  which we took on a big majority of our corn acres this year.  We didn't plant a single acre of corn.  We took prevent plant on all our corn acres  that we intended to plant.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:20):**  It shifted some to beans,  but it made economic sense for us to do that  and then also have the opportunity  to grow cover crops this next year,  perhaps in order to grow corn on those acres next year  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:32):**  and perhaps lower input costs  by maybe growing a lot of our nitrogen.  But what I comment on is we've paid into it  for over 25 years of our career  and we've had a couple of years  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:44):**  where we have had large claims.  So I look at it from an economic standpoint  in that aspect that it is sort of a backdrop for us.  Our operation is set up,  our infrastructure and our investments  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:42:56):**  are primarily around corn and soybean production.  And the opportunity that crop insurance has given us  is that with that backdrop that we have,  we have the ability to market those commodities  on the futures market at times when they are very profitable  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:15):**  and we know that we have a safety net  with the crop insurance underneath us.  That has been an intangible over that period  and we have paid into it the 25 years  we paid into it or so.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:26):**  That's been an intangible that actually has made  our operation a lot of profitability  because it's given us a confidence to market ahead  at prices that give us margin  and give us good return on equity  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:38):**  and good return on investment.  So I'm not gonna hammer the crop insurance aspect  because it works for our operation.  As far as soil health,  I would not disagree with the other participants  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:43:54):**  in the aspect that it does force us to sort of  a monoculture of corn and soybeans,  corn and soybeans, or maybe corn, corn, corn, corn  and maybe throw a soybean in there every once in a while.  And that is not good for soil health  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:07):**  and it's difficult to incorporate cover crops  and different soil health practices into that mix  that are going to advance regenerative agriculture.  We typically try to grow wheat every year  for what we call a rehab year.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:27):**  And that's kind of our rest year  where we can actually go in and grow wheat.  We can use compost, manures, different soil amendments  that are necessary, address compaction,  and then get some of these cover crop mixes in  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:44:42):**  that are sort of unique in order to really kind of advance  our health and our soils.  And we found that to actually be something  that has helped us build our soils in the system that we use  which is a commercial corn soybean system.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:03):**  Wonderful.  Thank you, David, for that perspective.  David Clingement, what thoughts do you have  on the crop insurance can of worms?  It is a big can of worms.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:11):**  You know, some of the struggles have been, you know,  I guess in the perspectives of when is a cover crop  terminated as a fact of crop insurance and stuff like that,  that's really shot a lot of people away  from using cover crops, I think,  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:26):**  just because of the terminology  and some of the RMA handbook and everything.  And there was a lot of confusion in it.  I think it's cleared up quite a bit now.  I guess I'm very hopeful for the state of Illinois.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:38):**  For the one thing that we've got going for us  is we'll have a $5 premium reduction on crop insurance  if you use a cover crop, mimicking what Iowa's done.  And so I'm really hopeful that maybe that will help  to get guys to do more cover crop practices.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:45:57):**  But at the same time, you know,  I don't know how much, you know, as we build our soils  and build our resilience to the soils and everything  and start to diversify out of a corn soybean pendulum,  not really a rotation, but you know,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:12):**  if we can, if we really need that crop insurance,  or if we just need more of that catastrophic,  like Steve was talking, wind and hail type insurance.  So yeah, I guess that's where I stand on that.  Thank you, David.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:26):**  There are a few questions that I think  would be of wide-scale interest.  One of them is we spoke about identifying the objectives  of the cover crops that we're growing.  If an objective is to shift the soil's microbial population  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:41):**  from being bacterially dominant to being fungally dominant,  what are some cover crop species that would really help  to accelerate that shift and drive that?  And if you have any thoughts or insights on that?  When you go to, I would say higher lignified covers  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:46:58):**  that are a little more complex versus higher sugar content,  higher sugar content covers, legumes, things of that nature,  tend to be digested pretty quickly  and are somewhat more bacterially dominated.  And Steve had talked about sorghum, sudangrass,  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:17):**  and even serorai that's left to mature  or things of that nature that have a higher carbon  to nitrogen ratio and are a little more lignified  and a little higher complex.  They typically seem to be a little better food sources  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:33):**  for fungal populations.  But however, I'll qualify that they also need  some more bacterially dominated covers in there  that are quickly digested to build bacterial populations  so that the fungal populations will actually piggyback  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:47:54):**  on bacterial populations as long as they have a food source,  a highly lignified food source  to basically feed on.  So in essence, David, what you're describing is  to grow a cover crops that have very broad carbon  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:09):**  and nitrogen ratios, lower levels of protein  and have a lot of carbon.  I would agree with that.  There is a very good question that has come up.  How do you facilitate germination of cover crops  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:20):**  in hot weather and dry soil when irrigation is limited?  So this is a very real concern  because I know some parts of the country  that where this pendulum has already swung  from one extreme this spring to the other extreme right now  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:32):**  where soils were already very dry and very warm.  So what answers would you have for that?  Brad Hobrock, do you have any thoughts or insights  on how to manage that?  Well, number one, if you have very, very adverse  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:44):**  soil conditions, i.e. very, very hot, very dry,  from a financial perspective,  if we're not likely to get them germinated  because of soil conditions are not ideal,  then should we be spending any money on it.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:48:57):**  In some of those situations,  and that could even be like a dry land sand here today  in Central Illinois, here in the Illinois River Valley.  But simply if it doesn't make sense,  is it worth spending money on it?  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:10):**  It's probably not.  Mitigating those things outside of looking  at weather forecasts, there's not a lot that can be done.  Thanks, Brad.  Pretty thorough and pretty answered.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:23):**  It's not the answer we would like to hear,  but it is the real answer, absolutely.  David Chance, do you have any thoughts to add to that?  No, I totally agree with him.  If you're in an adverse situation, there's not moisture,  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:36):**  and it's difficult to establish them like that.  I totally agree.  I mean, you need to either wait to moisture  or wait to get them established  because you'll be disappointed if you don't get response.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:49:50):**  I guess it's a question of how severe the problem is.  If you have severe challenges with not having enough  moisture, if they're severe enough,  it's completely impractical.  So let me add to that real quick, John.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:02):**  Even if you get germination to occur,  roots still need moisture in the soil to grow.  And if we don't have enough soil moisture  for that to happen, then once again,  there's just no sense in spending that money.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:14):**  Absolutely, Brad, thank you.  We have one final question that we'll address here.  Do we have any thoughts on cover crop species  for soils that have been damaged from multiple years  of herbicide, tillage, chemical fertilizer?  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:27):**  What cover crops could we use that might speed up  the bioremediation process of any residues  that might still remain in that soil profile?  Any thoughts on cover crops that might be able  to benefit that in particular,  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:40):**  if that is a specific objective?  The first thought that comes to my mind is root sticks.  Dirt.  So, you know, the annual rye grass species,  they're seeing clover, crimson clover,  
**[0:50:52-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:50:52):**  the lance of clover can really, really help  to remediate those types of situations.  Especially in a vineyard, having something  that's pollinator clover in there  can really be beneficial there.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:04):**  David, you just used a phrase that I'm unfamiliar with.  You used the phrase root stick soil.  What are you describing by that?  What do you mean?  So, soils weren't formed by a plow.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:14):**  They evolved by, you know, plants, roots interaction,  microbial interaction, and grazers going across  much of the earth at the same time.  So, the more roots that we can have out there,  more fibrous roots, you know,  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:29):**  a lot of people think about radishes  to help alleviate their compaction issues  where actually an annual rye grass  with a whole lot of root mass  will fix that compaction issue a lot quicker.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:42):**  So, it's just a term I heard here about a month ago  of roots fix dirt and it just makes a lot of sense.  I think maybe Rick Hammey says that.  Got it.  All right, well, we are coming up to the end of the hour.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:51:55):**  Do any of you have any final thoughts  you would like to add to the conversation,  things that we haven't talked about,  questions that I haven't asked,  anything else that is important to discuss that we've missed?  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:04):**  John, if I can real quick.  You know, we talked a little bit about bailing  some of these forages.  We really gotta be cautious on the nitrate levels on that,  nitrate and persic acid,  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:14):**  but we're either being grazed or being bailed off  to make sure we're not setting ourselves up  for a very catastrophic event with our livestock as well.  Thank you, David.  I want to thank each of you for joining  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:29):**  and for being a panelist here.  I know that many growers find this information  to be very valuable.  Many people will be listening to this  and I'm sure it'll be very valuable information.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/weather-resilience-through-cover-cropping-a-panel-discussion/#t=0:52:39):**  So, I want to say thank you for being here  and thank you for sharing  and look forward to having more conversations  with you in the future and happy growing.  Talk to you soon.

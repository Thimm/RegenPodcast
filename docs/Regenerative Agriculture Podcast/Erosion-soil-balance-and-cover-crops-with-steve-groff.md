**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm John Kempf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:06):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:02:47):**  and I also appreciate everything you're doing for agriculture and glad to be a part of this  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:02:53):**  discussion. Thanks, Steve. Steve, you've had a very fascinating pathway that has brought you to  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:02:58):**  the various activities and projects that you're working on today. What are some of the memorable  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:02):**  moments that led you to where you are today? Well, that goes back, I think, to the early 80s  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:08):**  when I started no-till. At that time, it was only for one reason. That was to stop soil erosion.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:15):**  I had no concept of soil health or not much of cover crops or anything. I didn't think it was  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:20):**  right that the soil was eroding off my fields. Every once in a while, I had to close the ditches  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:25):**  in order to be able to harvest my crops. That was my only motivation. It was just a nuisance.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:32):**  Plus, I didn't think it was right. I think that part of, I guess you'd say, a feeling  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:37):**  is valuable in knowing why I have continued to pursue what a lot of people call environmentally  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:43):**  friendly practices and so forth. A key moment was three years into no-till. I noticed that my soil  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:50):**  was beginning to mellow out. That surprised me. Nobody told me that was going to happen. I didn't  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:03:56):**  expect it. Just standard thought is you don't till, the soil is going to get hard. If it's  
**[0:04:01-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:01):**  addicted to tillage, it will. What we know today, we can transition from a till situation to a no-till  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:09):**  situation much faster than we could before. That was a key moment to actually see that occur here  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:17):**  on my field. The other thing was back in 1995. I was speaking, that was when I first started  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:25):**  speaking. Dr. Ray Weil was in the audience. He was talking about cover crops. When I  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:31):**  followed him, I asked the question in my speech, do cover crops pay? He came up to me afterwards  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:38):**  and said, I'd like to find out as well. Would you be willing to do some research on your farm?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:43):**  That ended up to be 12 years of cover crop research on my farm from 1995 to 2007. On the  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:52):**  fourth year of that, we had a drought year. Where I'd used cover crops, I had 28 bushels more of corn  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:04:58):**  that year. Now, it was preceding the previous three years. That was a key moment. Ever since  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:04):**  that, even though I still get the question today, do cover crops pay, I'm all in. I'd like to tell  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:10):**  people you can't pay me not to plant cover crops. I've seen the benefit. Then I'll just briefly say,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:15):**  finally here in this, John, that when the radishes came, Dr. Weil brought them to my farm.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:22):**  I was able to take that concept and develop a variety and establish the tillage radies.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:28):**  That really became a spark plug for cover crop interest across the country. That's going back  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:34):**  now about 17 years. To see the effect of that and everything has been a surprise to me.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:44):**  I have more of a gratefulness to discovering these things because everything I just told you about,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:52):**  I wasn't really looking for. It developed right under my feet almost. To see that experience,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:05:58):**  live with it, and now really actively promote it and teach people, I consider it a privilege to  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:06):**  have this platform. Steve, I'd like to learn more about your experiences and observations with  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:13):**  erosion, both on your own farm as well as other farms that you've worked on. When we look at the  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:18):**  USDA NRCS data for the state of Iowa, which is the one state that I'm intimately familiar with  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:24):**  the data for, the state of Iowa on average annually loses two pounds of topsoil for every  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:30):**  pound of corn produced. If you look just at the corn yield numbers across the entire state  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:35):**  and the soil loss numbers, it's two pounds of corn for every pound of, excuse me, two pounds  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:40):**  of topsoil for every pound of grain. That is an incredible number. When you extrapolate that out  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:46):**  into feeding beef, that means that every quarter pound hamburger represents the equivalent of four  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:52):**  pounds of topsoil. Wow. I've never heard it stated that way before. I'm usually amused at tons per  
**[0:06:57-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:06:57):**  acre, but that's actually more compelling because it's more relatable to people. My comment to that,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:05):**  and again with my journey involved in this, is why? Why? We have so much technology and  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:11):**  information now. We put a person on the moon what 40, 50 years ago, and we've done so many  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:17):**  great things in technology, but we haven't solved this erosion problem yet. To me, it gets me a  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:25):**  little excited as you can tell because it's just not necessary. Just last week, there was more  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:30):**  dust storms in Oklahoma, in Kansas, in Colorado, where they were concerned on the interstate  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:38):**  about traffic issues because of blowing dust. A month ago, it was the same problem. They shut  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:43):**  down I-70 from blowing dust. That's something you can physically see. What people don't see  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:51):**  is when the soil is eroded with water. Yeah, we see dirty water, but it's kind of like hidden.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:07:57):**  You don't really see it leaving. Last year, in the middle of May, there were two people killed  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:04):**  in Illinois with blowing dust where there's pile-ups on the roads. It just doesn't need to be.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:12):**  I just feel that with the use of cover crops, less tillage, no tillage, and judicious crop rotation,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:19):**  all this could be all but solved. Not only that, erosion is just a symptom of a bigger problem,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:26):**  not having a healthy soil. When you look at... We don't have so much of a runoff problem in  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:32):**  this country. We have an infiltration problem. Basically, once we get to learn how to grow a  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:40):**  healthy soil, how to create a healthy soil, what are the steps involved? Cover crops are certainly  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:46):**  a big part of that. When we learn to do that, the soil is simply not going to blow. It's simply not  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:51):**  going to wash away. Then we can start talking a little bit more technically of the soil aggregate  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:08:58):**  and glomalin that holds the aggregates together. All that stuff occurs in a healthy soil.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:05):**  We won't have all these problems. It's just a big... One of those many things in our mindset  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:11):**  that we're going to have to address. I guess you'd say encourage that with the... I'll call  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:18):**  it the regenerative agriculture movement that's emerging now. Some of this stuff is now being  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:24):**  looked at by mainstream agriculture. I don't want to get too far in my answer here, but I'm  
**[0:09:31-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:31):**  encouraged with what I'm seeing. In spite of where we're at, I'm encouraged with the awareness and  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:40):**  the direction we're headed here in the last couple of years. Do you believe that using cover crops  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:45):**  and these regenerative farming practices in developing... You mentioned a very key phrase  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:51):**  that really caught my attention. We don't have a runoff problem. We have a water infiltration  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:09:55):**  problem. That rings really true because when you have good soil porosity, of course, that removes  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:02):**  both wind and water erosion to a very substantial degree. It definitely has a big impact. I guess  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:08):**  the question that I'd have for you is, can we completely resolve erosion with the use of cover  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:13):**  crops? It's not just cover crops. There's a lot of other practices go in there. To answer your  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:19):**  question very directly, we can greatly, greatly reduce it. I don't want to say we can completely  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:26):**  eliminate it because there are some events sometimes that are catastrophic that happen.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:32):**  Some of that is what it is. The Grand Canyon was eroded. I doubt if it was the lack of cover crops.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:41):**  That's an extreme example. Cover crops are a key component. Again, we're talking about  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:48):**  a healthy system. Cover crops are just a part of the system because just using a cover crop  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:10:55):**  has got to go beyond that. Because really stepping back from the tools, which cover crop is a tool,  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:03):**  I guess that's what I'm trying to say. How you manage that tool is very important. I like to  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:09):**  use the example of a hammer. You give me a hammer, I'm not the best guy to build a house because  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:15):**  that's not what I do. You give the hammer to a carpenter, they're going to build a beautiful house,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:21):**  whatever they're building. Same with cover crops, same with no-till. Those are just tools.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:27):**  Just because you buy a bag of cover crop seeds doesn't make you a cover crop farmer. So we step  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:33):**  back and we look at the principles. Some of those principles directly include cover crops.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:39):**  Having a living root in the soil as much as possible, I'm going to say year-round if possible.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:46):**  Having our soil covered, and that's going to occur if there's something growing there.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:51):**  Having diversity of species, we can greatly enhance that with cover crops because we can  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:11:56):**  plant multiple species together or related to that is an intensive crop rotation. I get the fact that  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:03):**  some areas of the country, it's a little less options as far as what kind of a cash crop that  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:09):**  they literally can grow and have a market for, although I think that's an excuse used by a lot  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:13):**  of people too often. So there's some limitations, but if you can sneak a cover crop in there and  
**[0:12:18-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:18):**  plant four, five, twelve different species together, you got that. And then the final part is less or  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:26):**  low, no soil disturbance. So those are part of the big principles. Cover crops are a part of that  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:32):**  big principles in the scenario there. You say that cover crops are a tool for farmers to use. What  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:39):**  are some of the other important tools that farmers should consider incorporating into their systems?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:44):**  Beyond cover crops, what comes to mind here is your fertility management. I think that plays a  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:51):**  huge role again in your soil health and some of the no-nos in my opinion, and then again,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:12:59):**  I know there's different people listening to this, but in hydrocemonia, you want to avoid that,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:05):**  especially for the corn farmers out there, if at all possible. It just doesn't help your soil's  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:11):**  health. Some of the high salt fertilizers and so forth or other things that are just not good,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:18):**  fertility is a tool. And again, it's knowing how to manage what is out there, what's available.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:24):**  But I would also mention while on that topic that once you get your soil functioning and allow the  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:30):**  microbes to come back in their diversity and all their, just the magnitude of opportunities there  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:38):**  with the microbes, they can start in a kind of an indirect way and maybe direct way helping the  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:45):**  soil fertility, unlocking things that were locked up before, making different elements and minerals  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:52):**  more available. So sometimes we don't have a fertility problem, we have a microbial problem,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:13:58):**  and there's a definite relation to that. So again, fertility is a tool and tillage is a tool. Again,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:05):**  I'm a no-till farmer. That's what I do on my farm. It works well for me, but I'm not saying  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:12):**  that the whole world should go to no-till. There's certainly exceptions could be argued for that,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:18):**  but I will strongly say that less tillage is the least tillage is possible. Tillage is a destructive  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:26):**  event. It can harm fungi, it can harm soil life. We all know earthworms are not really happy when  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:33):**  we ruin their homes and so forth. So again, tillage is a tool. Learning how to use it  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:40):**  appropriately, or I could say not using it appropriately, is going to help us have a  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:46):**  better and healthier soil. So that's just a couple that come to mind there, John. I know there's more  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:53):**  tools out there that go on, but that's probably some of the key ones. Yeah, I certainly agree with  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:14:58):**  you that tillage is, I believe that tillage is a very important tool and it needs to be used in the  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:04):**  right place at the right time for the right reasons. It can be a very powerful tool, but it can  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:08):**  also be very disruptive if mismanaged. Completely agree. Yeah. How important, you mentioned the  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:14):**  value of having a diversity of crops and diversity in crop rotation, which has been a recurring theme  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:20):**  with the various guests that I've had on the podcast. How important do you believe it is to  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:24):**  have a diversity of cover crops? Yeah, well first of all, I have done literally thousands of research  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:34):**  tests over the last 15 years here on my farm. And just so you know, some of them are very small,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:41):**  10 by 10 type things. So just to give a little perspective there. That being said, is I would say  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:49):**  there is a time and a place sometimes for single species cover crops. The most notable is when it  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:15:57):**  gets late in the fall, pretty much only cereal rye or maybe triticale can survive. So there's a,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:04):**  it's pretty obvious in that situation. If you're maybe looking at a compaction issue that's fairly  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:13):**  substantial, at least using something like radishes or like an annual rye grass to help break  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:19):**  up that compaction deep in the soil is an argument for just single species. Or I'll just say, while  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:25):**  we're talking about radishes, they're such an easy cover crop to establish, to get going, and they  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:30):**  usually winter kill in most areas that it gets leased to the mid-teens over the winter. So it's  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:34):**  like a cover crop with training wheels, I like to say. And that's a nice way to get farmers started  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:40):**  because they can usually see a difference. Now as far as mixed species, I always plant mixed  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:46):**  species. And that becomes like a kind of like a science in itself. And I don't want to make it too  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:52):**  complicated, but you have to start playing around with some stuff and see what works on your own  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:16:58):**  farm. Most farmers don't like when I say that because they want us to give them a prescription,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:03):**  and this is the magic formula here. It just doesn't work that way. And through my experience  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:10):**  over time, I have come to desire certain species in the mixes of my farm. I'll just say a couple  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:17):**  where I like to have a radish in whenever it's in its planting window. And something like the  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:25):**  cesalia, which is kind of a rare cover crop yet, but it's very popular in Europe. I really like  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:30):**  to have a little bit of that mixed in. And then of course, some of the grains and some of the  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:36):**  summer annuals and winter annuals, sorghum, sedan grass, and sun hemp over summer. They're some of  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:41):**  the key, I call them the foundational ingredients of a cover crop mix. And then if there's nuances  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:47):**  that you're trying to address, you can stick in some other ones. Or sometimes the seed cost is  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:53):**  inexpensive or expensive on certain species that you need to kind of ebb and flow from the  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:17:59):**  economic side of it. Now I get the question frequently, well how many species do you need?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:07):**  Because you hear of guys, 12 to 20 species, and I've done all that. But what I have found is once  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:16):**  you get beyond six to eight species, the advantages start to level off. Now if you have a reason to  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:23):**  use 12 species, 14, 18, whatever, that's fine. Just know what you're doing and mixing them together.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:30):**  And I will say for those who've never done this, mixed species doesn't necessarily mean higher  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:35):**  cost per acre. You do need to adjust rates and ratios. And that being said, with the synergistic  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:42):**  effects that happen because of mixed species, you can reduce your seeding rate to less than  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:48):**  the division of the amount of seeds in your mix that you're planting if you're basing it on single  
**[0:18:55-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:18:55):**  species planting rates of each of those species. So I like to say in cover crop mixes, one plus one  
**[0:19:03-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:03):**  equals three. So you can really bring back the total amount in your mix. But I haven't seen a  
**[0:19:12-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:12):**  lot of benefits beyond six or so. So in my situation here on my farm, I want to have at least  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:20):**  five or six species if I can in the planting window. That's kind of where I have it pegged out  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:27):**  here, what my experience has been. And that has been looking at yields, subsequent yields of  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:32):**  different species and so forth. And so that's just where I've found to work. I would say in a grazing  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:38):**  situation where you're going to use your cover crops to graze, which by the way is really the  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:43):**  best way to do it if you have animals. But there I could see an argument for upping your amount of  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:49):**  species as well, just to diversify the diet and so forth of those that are the animals that are  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:19:55):**  eating it. So yeah, I'm thinking in the sixth range is the amount of species I like to see,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:00):**  but if there's a reason to go higher, that's fine as well. Yeah. And just to add to your thoughts,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:08):**  I have, we have one other place or one other situation where I see a lot of value in using  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:13):**  single species. And that is where we particularly want to develop a disease suppressive soil very  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:20):**  quickly. So if we want to develop a disease suppressive soil for specific soil, more pathogens  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:25):**  like the cerium or verticillium, a cover crop that is primarily or 100% oats or mustard or something  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:31):**  like that can have a major impact very, very quickly. I agree. What is something that you  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:36):**  have puzzled over for a long period of time? Well, what comes to mind, I'm probably going to bring  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:41):**  this up a couple of times is, and I'm going to skip ahead here a little bit. I haven't been  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:45):**  talking about this much. I know you're involved in this, but the whole link to human health,  
**[0:20:51-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:20:51):**  and I'll just say from the way we grow our plants that eventually get into the, to humans eating  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:01):**  their plants, how we grow and the nutrients that are available in that plant or that food product.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:09):**  The word nutrient density is being used quite frequently these days by kind of the, I'll just  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:15):**  call it yet the cutting edge of regenerative agriculture. And I'm trying to figure that out.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:21):**  I know that I have something with my cropping system here of long-term no-till and long-term  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:26):**  use of cover crops and a fairly diverse species on my farm. I've done a little bit of testing  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:34):**  with this, but that's what I'm active in now. So maybe the word is not puzzling. Maybe it's  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:40):**  more curious, but at least it feels a little puzzling to me now because I hear different  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:44):**  things. I'm trying to figure out how can I do this and then also to help others with the knowledge I  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:50):**  have. So that's where I, that's where I, how to answer that question at the moment. That's what  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:21:54):**  came to mind first. And where are you on your journey of discovery at this point? What have  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:00):**  you found that has been really intriguing? Well, I've taken some nutritional analysis of like my  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:06):**  butternut squash and the only thing we have to go on now as far as the standard is the average  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:13):**  that the USDA publishes. And I dug into that a little bit and they don't really tell you,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:20):**  or they won't tell you, I got to say it that way, when and where, and how do they establish  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:28):**  their average of a butternut squash? You know, how much of those nutrients are actually,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:35):**  you know, what was the background of all that? So I just have to assume they probably pull some off  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:41):**  the shelf at a couple of different places and run the numbers together. Now, when I've looked at  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:46):**  mine, I, my butternut squash is tested higher in everything but sodium. And I'm not sure if that  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:22:54):**  might be a good thing if it wasn't higher in sodium. But I've not got into the complex  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:00):**  enzyme and vitamins and stuff yet, but it's encouraging what I'm seeing here. So since I  
**[0:23:06-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:06):**  grow a lot of vegetables, squash and tomatoes, multiple types of squash, I am going to be  
**[0:23:16-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:16):**  looking into and I've set in motion creating some sort of a label and branding for that.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:23):**  And I'm starting to work with some of the retailers that are actually interested in.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:29):**  There aren't many yet that are seriously interested. Some of them say, yeah, yeah,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:33):**  they like that idea, but they don't even hardly know what they're talking about yet. So I see  
**[0:23:39-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:39):**  that is the future of agriculture, where we can literally market our produce. And I will say  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:48):**  eventually the commodities on a nutritional basis, rather than yield. And as I'm understanding,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:23:56):**  we are within the year we will have a smartphone app that you'll be able to actually use to go up  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:03):**  in a store and be able to get a fairly basic readout of nutritional density of products and  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:09):**  stores. So if indeed that does occur and is consistent, I think that's going to help and drive  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:16):**  this market because farmers, if they have an opportunity for marketing, they will figure it  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:22):**  out. That's the way farmers are. So I'm really optimistic about that. I think that's where the  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:30):**  future's gone. So that's kind of where I'm at now, trying to figure it out, trying to find my way.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:36):**  But I'm committed to learning more along those lines. Steve, this is a fascinating topic that I'm  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:42):**  personally very passionate about as well. So there's a number of thoughts that pop into  
**[0:24:49-0:24:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:49):**  mind. Perhaps the first very simple one, one of my colleagues did some digging into the USDA data.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:24:57):**  This is going back half a dozen years or more and discovered that at least historically, perhaps  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:02):**  not so much recently, but historically much of that database might be composed of perhaps six or  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:09):**  eight samples for a given crop for an entire year across the entire US. That's nothing. That's an  
**[0:25:16-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:16):**  extremely small representative pool, but you're right. It really is nothing. So I personally,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:24):**  going back to one of the comments that you made quite some time ago, I suspect that the reality  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:29):**  is that our crops are perhaps not as nutrient deficient as some people might expect when  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:35):**  compared with historical standards, particularly in the area of the mineral profile, zinc,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:41):**  manganese, copper, and so forth. I'm sure there have been some shifts and changes. Where I suspect  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:46):**  there possibly have been substantial changes is in the profile of the various secondary metabolites,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:52):**  phytoalexins, and so forth. I think those immune compounds or medicinal compounds and aroma and  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:25:58):**  flavor compounds probably have shifted substantially. There's many reasons for that.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:04):**  So based on what you're describing, do you believe it's possible, you mentioned this,  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:08):**  but I just wanted to go back to it again. Do you believe it's possible that farmers will actually  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:13):**  be compensated for growing quality? Well, maybe I'll answer it this way,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:19):**  but I'll just generally answer yes. We have been paid on yield, and the repurbations of that are  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:29):**  through every aspect of the whole food chain, and I'm specifically thinking back to plant breeders.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:37):**  Plant breeders are breeding the plants that we farm for yield, and that's a problem because we  
**[0:26:46-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:46):**  now have the majority of our genetics in our plant are made for yield. So it's going to take a while,  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:26:54):**  I think, to get this right, decades probably, or probably even more because it's such a complex  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:02):**  issue. But again, I'm encouraged. I just found out recently there is indeed some plant breeders now  
**[0:27:11-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:11):**  who are going to breed for flavor, nutrient density, and such aspects as simply basically  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:19):**  human health aspects. And sure, we've got to have a decent yield coming out of it. I mean,  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:24):**  that's kind of understood. So I'm actively, I'm going to be a part of some of that. I'm actually  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:31):**  testing some seeds this year that are coming out of some preliminary breeding work that's being  
**[0:27:37-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:37):**  done, just to see where we're at on that. So I think the breeding aspect of it is a very important  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:46):**  component of this as well, one that sometimes people don't think about. So yeah, I do believe  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:27:53):**  that we're going to be able to make changes, and I believe that farmers will, it's going to happen  
**[0:28:00-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:00):**  two ways. Some will compensate them for it. I don't think farmers should be holding out for like  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:08):**  a 25% premium for a nutritionally dense food. I think that's the wrong way to think about it.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:15):**  I think that you need to study and do your own research, collaborate with others to make it  
**[0:28:21-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:21):**  happen. And along the way, there will be markets that will develop that will pay you that 25%  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:29):**  extra, but you're going to have to prove it first. And I'm not sure how that's all going to filter  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:36):**  out. So in some aspects, you're going to have the first adopters on the retail side as saying,  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:43):**  this is what we want, and then you will probably not be able to grow enough for them what they  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:49):**  want. So I think it's going to come two ways. It's going to come from demand, and also I think there  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:53):**  will be a price incentive or a compensation, I'm going to call it, involved in it, but I don't  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:28:58):**  think to grow it for that. I think that's the wrong way to approach it. And that's, I'll just  
**[0:29:04-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:04):**  say an example, and I'll just use the organic model. If you're growing organic food and organic  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:12):**  methods just to get a price premium, you probably are not the best caretaker of the soil. That's not  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:20):**  saying that's exclusive, but in my experience in looking at what I'm going to call the good organic  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:26):**  farms are the ones who are doing it based on principle, not because they're getting a premium.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:31):**  So I'll just make that analogy crossover what I think, let's just use the word regenerative  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:38):**  agriculture here now, nutrient density. I believe that you, instead of doing it for a premium,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:44):**  you need to do it because that's the future, that's what we're going to be doing. And yeah,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:48):**  you'll have a market for it if you accomplish it. I have a few thoughts based on what you've said,  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:29:53):**  Steve. One of them is that I think it's sometimes easy for us as farmers to disconnect from the fact  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:00):**  that the first priority for the crops that we're producing is to grow food. It's sometimes easy  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:06):**  for us to become disconnected from that. And so I think what I see evolving, that there's kind of  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:12):**  two different macro trends, if you will. One of them is in the commodity crops, corn grains,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:18):**  et cetera. I do see, I suspect that in the future, from what I'm observing, we will see an evolution  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:26):**  of the market where growers will be compensated directly for components, protein content,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:32):**  test weight, so forth, which is already beginning to happen in some regions and I think is going to  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:36):**  become even more pronounced. Sure. In the fruit and vegetable space, obviously that would also  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:42):**  be a possibility, but I think there is something else that is much more immediate and much more  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:46):**  direct in the fruit and vegetable space than components. What fruit and vegetable buyers  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:30:52):**  care about is flavor and aroma. They care about flavor and aroma. And those components,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:00):**  the compounds that produce flavor and components are of course the same compounds that are a result  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:06):**  of nutrient density. So I think when we talk about measuring nutrient density on fruits and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:12):**  vegetables and measuring nutritional profiles, it becomes a very complicated conversation very  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:16):**  just because there's so many compounds and there's so much that we don't know about them yet.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:22):**  Everybody understands flavor and aroma. Right. Well, I'll just take off on that a little bit.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:27):**  You're exactly right. And flavor and aroma is what generates repeat customers, which that's a great  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:34):**  business model when you think about it. And the beauty of it is generally, and I think you pretty  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:40):**  much just said this, when you have great flavor, when you have great aroma, you undoubtedly have  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:46):**  great nutritional density. So I think that will be a key driver in this. My, I guess you'd say caution  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:31:54):**  for some people is, is it is very complex sometimes to achieve this. I don't even know if I can  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:01):**  achieve it the way I want to yet. I'm working on it. I'm getting somewhere. But it's as we say,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:09):**  it's a journey and we're learning, but this is certainly the direction that we want to be headed  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:14):**  in. And there's nothing better. And I've already got these comments. There's nothing better than,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:20):**  you know, wow, your tomatoes are sweeter or your pumpkins are brighter orange, your gourds are  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:26):**  brighter, they're more brilliant. I've heard that several times. And, you know, that has to be traced  
**[0:32:30-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:30):**  back to healthy or something, you know, minerals, whatever you want to say. And that has certainly  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:39):**  solidified some of my markets because they like what they're seeing in that. And then the whole  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:45):**  taste is as well. And I will just reiterate again, taste, even aroma can also be partly traced back to  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:53):**  genetic in a plant and plant breeding. And so it's not just nutrition. And if you have a, if you,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:32:59):**  if you have a tomato that was used in the 1980s that was popular back then, that really didn't  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:05):**  taste good, or even now yet we have some that are just made for shipping, you know, you can maybe  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:10):**  help that tomato by good nutrition, but you're really trying to restore a shabby house  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:16):**  when you're trying to do that. So building from the ground up, and that's why I think it goes back  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:20):**  to the genetics of some of the plants that are important here. It's a missing ingredient in some  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:25):**  of these discussions of nutritional density. And, you know, I know we all go back and talk about  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:30):**  heirloom varieties and everything, but, you know, heirloom varieties are great in that, but there's  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:35):**  some other weaknesses they have and we can improve. So I like, that's what I like about 21st century  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:40):**  agriculture. It's a combination of biology and technology. So to bringing all these things  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:46):**  together here now, going back and getting some of the things we forgot and then marrying them with  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:53):**  current technology and plant breeding and all that, I think we definitely have opportunity to  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:33:58):**  move forward with a better tasting product. And this, you know, we talk about, you know,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:04):**  vegetables, humans, consumption, everything, but the same applies to corn, soybeans that are fed  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:09):**  to pigs and cows and everything else. We'll be able to do that with less feed, more nutritious,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:16):**  and even the meat will taste better. So, you know, everything we apply to our soil almost can be,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:23):**  you can almost take it so far as it's the same thing that applies to our gut. And I know that's  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:28):**  a big stretch for some people, but there is a connection there. And that's something, again,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:33):**  you asked earlier about puzzling me. I'm still trying to connect the dots on that. I'm just a  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:39):**  farmer, you know, but it still does interest me. I think I got to know a little bit so I can  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:44):**  understand how to best manage to make this happen. Well, I would certainly say that the  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:49):**  similarities between the microbiome in our digestive tract and the microbiome in a rhizosphere,  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:34:55):**  the similarities are much greater than the differences for certain. And I completely agree  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:00):**  with you on the genetics piece. Genetics are a very important part. And what has been fascinating  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:05):**  for us is we've developed the use of plant sap analysis and have begun looking at nutritional  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:11):**  profiles of different varieties. We found that there's actually a nutritional foundation for the  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:19):**  performance of different genetics. So, you can have three varieties of tomatoes grown in the  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:24):**  exact same soil with the exact same management, and they will have three completely different  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:28):**  nutritional profiles based on their genetic capability of absorbing nutrients. So, genetics  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:32):**  are definitely a very important. Yeah, I believe that. And we see some of that work being done  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:37):**  in grains, for example, with some of the work that Charlie Brown is doing with corn seed, with  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:43):**  Brown seed genetics, some very impressive work in increasing the quality of grain crops. Good.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:50):**  Steve, what is something that has surprised you in the work that you've been doing? Well, if I answer  
**[0:35:55-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:35:55):**  that question in the context of basically my, I'll just say last 30, 40 years of agriculture,  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:03):**  and I alluded to this at the very beginning, what has surprised me is I had no idea what soil health  
**[0:36:09-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:09):**  was, what cover crops could do, what less no tillage could do. So, that has totally surprised  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:17):**  me. If you would take me back to 1982, when I first started, that's the year I graduated from  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:22):**  high school. When I first started farming the farm here with my dad, I took over more  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:27):**  responsibilities at that point. And you would have said, what I'm doing today, I would have said,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:32):**  I just wouldn't believe you. So, I think that's probably the thing that sticks out to me,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:38):**  everything that soil health can do. And I think more recently here, in the last 10 years now,  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:45):**  and this is again, I'd never expected this, once you get this system working, you don't need as  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:51):**  much input, you don't need as much fertilizer, you don't need as much pesticides. And the degree of  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:36:57):**  how you reduce all that is very inherent to your philosophy and everything. But it's exciting for  
**[0:37:04-0:37:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:04):**  me to be able to have a healthier soil, it's actually more economical. That has surprised me.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:14):**  I know this is kind of big picture type stuff here, but that's a pleasant surprise. I guess  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:20):**  I'd have to say. And I want to continue that because I am now, I guess you'd say I'm old  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:27):**  enough to realize that I'm expecting to be surprised in the next 10 to 20 years as well.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:33):**  And I'm just looking for those surprises. And that's why I like to be a farmer because  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:39):**  we're not going to figure this out in my lifetime. And I can wake up every morning kind of wondering  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:46):**  what I may discover today. And I know a lot of farmers don't carry that kind of mindset,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:51):**  but I think they should in a small way in order to make this happen. You have to be committed to it.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:37:57):**  What do you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other people  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:04):**  might not believe to be true? Well, I might have just said one of them there. When I talk about  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:11):**  reducing inputs like fertilizer, the common reaction from some is, oh, you're going to mine  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:16):**  out the soil. Yeah, that might work for a couple of years. But I'm getting into this far enough  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:22):**  now that that argument's becoming debunked because we're actually using less than ever  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:27):**  purchased fertilizer. And so right there, I think modern agriculture certainly is not doing that.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:34):**  The other thing I guess I would say is that it kind of goes along with that, just the use of  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:40):**  insecticides and fungicides and so forth can be decreased. And for instance, last two years,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:46):**  I have not used any insecticides on my pumpkins. And I grow 48, 49 acres of pumpkins last year.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:52):**  So it's not like it's a garden plot. And when you talk about that with challenges of squash  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:38:58):**  bug and cucumber beetle and marmorated stink bug, that's a pretty big deal. Well, it's a big deal.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:04):**  Well, it is. And I actually haven't advertised that very much because I'm still kind of almost  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:11):**  a skeptic myself. And I will say this, John, that if there's a flare up, it's a pretty valuable crop.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:18):**  And I need to do some kind of control. I'll do it. And hopefully the least impacting way they do.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:25):**  They do have some better insecticides now that are more narrow spectrum, but I don't  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:29):**  indiscriminately spray. I mean, I have heard of people who are throwing insecticide every  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:34):**  time they spray their pumpkins, and then they wonder why they have aphid problems.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:38):**  So I also, I mean, there's more to the story. I plant pollinator plots around my woods to encourage  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:46):**  and attract beneficial insects. Because of my long-term no-till here, some of my fields  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:52):**  haven't been tilled for 37 years, I got nice habitats of ground dwelling insects,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:39:57):**  particularly the squash bee. I do not bring in extra beehives. I got plenty of bees. People talk  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:03):**  about bees, low number of, I know they're mainly talking about honeybees, but I have the native  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:09):**  pollinators here. They're actually better than honeybees. And we've had Penn State in here and  
**[0:40:13-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:13):**  USDA. And when you go out in my field in July in the morning in a pumpkin field, you can just hear  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:20):**  the buzzing everywhere. So maybe I'll have a tangent there a little bit. But again, I did not  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:26):**  start going down this trail to try to accomplish this. But now that I'm seeing what's going on,  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:34):**  I'm now like, hey, how can I take this even further? So I think that for modern agriculture,  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:40):**  they find that hard to believe that you can actually reduce. And I'm not going to say I've  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:46):**  eliminated yet. I've only done it two years. But again, I might never say that I eliminated,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:51):**  because I always, I guess that's one reason why I'm not organic. Because if there is some years,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:40:58):**  for whatever reason, either my management screw up or whatever, I want the availability to,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:04):**  I guess you say rescue the crop. But I have gone away from the routine application of an  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:11):**  insurance policy type on that. I heard someone say already, and this makes people think,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:17):**  would you take chemo to prevent cancer? So maybe a little bit of a pretty wide,  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:25):**  a wild analogy, but there's a point there. So anyway, but...  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:29):**  Yeah, there absolutely is a point with what we have learned about the impact of pesticides on  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:35):**  plants from a protein synthesis perspective. There absolutely is a very credible point there.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:39):**  That's right.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:40):**  Yeah. Steve, what do you think is the biggest opportunity in agriculture today?  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:43):**  Well, I think because in the context of general low commodity prices, and I'm just speaking here  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:49):**  of general agriculture, right now we're kind of in a, I guess you'd say a depressed ag economy,  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:41:56):**  especially the dairy. These cycles happen and it's not new, and there doesn't seem to be a  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:04):**  promising end in sight, so to speak. But boy, this whole concept of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:11):**  and being able to grow healthier crops with less inputs certainly should have an impact. Because  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:21):**  I have heard of several farmers who have backed into this whole philosophy because they simply  
**[0:42:27-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:27):**  could not afford to buy fertilizer or to buy input. And because of that, now they are very  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:34):**  successful farmers. And they have said that had that not occurred, they may not have ever got into  
**[0:42:40-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:40):**  cover crops or got into no-till. So there's opportunity out there. I believe I'm also a  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:48):**  farmer, I'm a realist, and if you're in dairy right now, you have a high investment in your  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:53):**  livestock and probably your buildings and everything else. You just can't just magically  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:42:59):**  snap your fingers and pull out of it. But just in thinking of the reality though of long-term,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:05):**  I think this way of growing things is a win-win-win. It's a win for the farmer, lower cost.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:11):**  It's a win for providing better nutritious food. And then as a side benefit, the environment  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:18):**  is treated better. And farmers get defensive sometimes when you talk about the environment  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:25):**  or environmentalism, and I get that. And I still react too to some environmental regulations that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:32):**  are out there. But I live in the Chesapeake Bay region, and people ask me when I'm out of my  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:39):**  region, so what's it like to live in the Chesapeake Bay with all those regulations you have to put up  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:44):**  with and everything? And I say it hasn't affected me at all. I've already been doing it. And I've  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:50):**  got awards for it, and I didn't do it for the awards. And you could say we're doing the right  
**[0:43:56-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:43:56):**  thing. But my motivation is it is the right thing, but it's also economically attractive once you  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:04):**  understand it. And this is where we're kind of at a junction here with, I'll just say, cover crops,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:10):**  and use that example, that it's kind of the cool thing to do. You see it in every magazine that  
**[0:44:16-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:16):**  comes out. But it's a very simple concept, but very complex to be able to achieve. And the example  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:25):**  I like to give there, it's like going from being a nurse to a surgeon. There's a lot, lot more  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:30):**  involved to make that jump and that switch. And frankly, we haven't had the experience or the  
**[0:44:36-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:36):**  knowledge here in the last 50, 60 years, especially using cover crops. And we have to reach back  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:43):**  sometimes for that. But also in the context of modern technology, we're going to have to  
**[0:44:48-0:44:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:48):**  sift some of this stuff out. So I believe that there's bright future ahead. And this is just,  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:44:55):**  just obviously I'm committed to it and trying to show others how to do the same.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:00):**  Steve, what is a book or resource that you recommend the most often to growers?  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:06):**  Well, oh, I got, I should look at my bookshelf here. And by the way, I read books. I think  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:13):**  that's part of my success to gain knowledge all the time. As far as recommendations go,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:20):**  one of the last ones I've read was by David Montgomery, Growing a Revolution. And that's just  
**[0:45:26-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:26):**  to really give you a kind of a broad picture view of examples of case studies, if you will,  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:33):**  farmers who are actually doing this and making it work. Yeah, that's one of them right there that  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:39):**  just came out that I recommend. I've been influenced over the years by some of Dan Skow's  
**[0:45:46-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:46):**  books, Pigeon's another one, Gary Zimmer, the biological farmer. Way back in the beginning,  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:45:54):**  I would say for me, Carlos Criveto from the country of Chile was one of the world's leading  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:00):**  no-till farmers and uses cover crops. He had a book called Double Over the Soil that was good.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:05):**  Another book that would make people think is The One-Stroll Revolution. It's by Masanobuko  
**[0:46:11-0:46:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:11):**  Fukuoka. Took me a while to learn how to say that, by the way. He's a Japanese guy. And that'll make  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:21):**  you think. I mean, he did some things there in Japan. It's not new. That book is not new,  
**[0:46:27-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:27):**  but it'll cause you to, you know, for some introspection there and how food is grown. So,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:34):**  yeah, there's a lot of good materials out there. It depends a little bit on what your specific  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:39):**  angle is, but that's just some of them that have impacted me. Yeah, I believe the other two,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:44):**  one of them being The One-Stroll Revolution, and then also a second one titled Natural Farming,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:48):**  and both of them are good. Yes. What technology or ideas are you excited about for the future  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:46:54):**  of agriculture? We've talked a bit about cover crops and the development of genetics for crops  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:00):**  that have a greater degree of nutritional integrity. What other things do you see happening  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:05):**  in the future of agriculture that you're really excited about? Well, one of them now, and it does  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:09):**  relate to cover crops, is the advancement on equipment needed to handle cover crops,  
**[0:47:16-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:16):**  all the way from cover crop rollers to planter attachments to accommodate standing cover crops  
**[0:47:25-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:25):**  or rolling down cover crops as you're planting. To see mainline companies now starting to see it to  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:33):**  be worthwhile to produce some equipment like this, I just saw, for instance, Kinsey, which is probably  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:40):**  the number two corn planter company next to John Deere, I'm assuming. I don't know the numbers,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:45):**  but they're really, really strong and popular. They just started making a cover crop feeding  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:52):**  this so they can use, for instance, their 15-inch soybean planters to plant cover crops with  
**[0:47:57-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:47:57):**  precision planters. That's a great signal to me that now I can say mainstream agriculture is  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:05):**  starting to acknowledge cover crops. Some of the big sprayers that were used to spray or to put on  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:11):**  fertilizer are now being converted to apply cover crops in standing corn or corn anywhere from  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:18):**  knee-high to three weeks before harvest, high clearance vehicles that can get through.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:23):**  Some of that technology out there, one of the things that I'm excited about that is on the  
**[0:48:30-0:48:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:30):**  horizon is there's a company in Canada that made a planter or seeder that can actually carry six  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:39):**  different types of feed as it is planting in the field. It's pretty much of a state-of-the-art  
**[0:48:45-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:45):**  system where you can actually theoretically yet, but they're actually working on it. I've talked  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:48:54):**  to the company. You can actually adjust your species, for instance, in cover crops here.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:00):**  You can adjust the species to soil types. As you plant across the field, you can program in  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:06):**  different areas of the field for different cover crop mixes that you would want to plant.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:10):**  And that would be absolutely cool to see a field that was variable rate precision planted with mixed  
**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:18):**  species of cover crop after that cover crop comes up and just see how that looks. Again, if you  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:25):**  think ahead, that's going to take a lot of research. What are the best species for certain  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:30):**  areas? One of the things that'll be easy in that is variable seeding rate where cover crops may go  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:36):**  the opposite of cash crops where you may want to up the seeding rate in poor areas and decrease the  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:42):**  seeding rate on good parts of the field. So there again, that's why I say it's this exciting times  
**[0:49:47-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:47):**  here, 21st century, marrying biology with modern technology where we can actually utilize something  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:49:57):**  like our cover crop tool here and maximize that across our field. So that's some things that come  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:03):**  to mind on what I see, what spikes me about coming up in the future. Steve, this has been a  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:09):**  very intriguing conversation. I've got to ask you this question. Are you having fun? Oh, am I having  
**[0:50:14-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:14):**  fun? Yes, I am having fun. No one ever asked me that before. That's great. Yeah, it's not just  
**[0:50:25-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:25):**  fun. There's a sense of, yeah, how should I say this? A sense of, I don't know what the word is  
**[0:50:34-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:34):**  here, but when I travel and sometimes to other countries, international, when I'm coming home,  
**[0:50:43-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:43):**  it's just like, it's just a good feeling of I'm able to help farmers, number one. And then for me,  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:51):**  just from my approach to life, number two is being a steward of God's earth and being able to be a  
**[0:50:57-0:51:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:50:57):**  part of that is humbling, but yet very, very satisfying. So that pretty much maybe would sum  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:03):**  up a little bit more of how I feel about what I do. I think perhaps the word you were looking for  
**[0:51:09-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:09):**  is fulfillment. I know. Yeah, that's it. I believe you're right. Yeah, it is. It is. Yep. What is the  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:16):**  one action that you would recommend that any farmer who is new and starting down this pathway  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:21):**  should take right away? Well, first of all, if we're talking about cover crops is to think about  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:27):**  what you want to accomplish. Going way back for me, it was simply soil erosion. What is it for you  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:33):**  as a farmer? What are you trying to accomplish? And that's very important. It can be more than  
**[0:51:38-0:51:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:38):**  one thing, but you might want to prioritize it, especially if you're new, because you want to be  
**[0:51:44-0:51:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:44):**  very specific about trying to achieve whatever that goal is. And then you start asking the next  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:49):**  questions, what time of the year is it that will determine the plant species that are planted?  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:51:55):**  And then you just can kind of go from there, but it's very, very fundamental. What are you trying  
**[0:52:00-0:52:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:00):**  to accomplish? And then I would also caution farmers to only apply a new practice to the amount  
**[0:52:09-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:09):**  of acres that they can afford to either lose or afford to not have maybe quite the standards that  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:20):**  they're used to. And I have seen recently with the momentum of the cover crop movement, some farmers  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:27):**  all of a sudden say, yep, that's what I want to do. I want all these beneficial things. And they  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:32):**  don't understand all the nuances. I mean, I've been doing this for like 25 years, very intensively in  
**[0:52:37-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:37):**  cover crops, and I'm learning stuff every year. So learn all you can would be another advice I would  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:45):**  give. And that, you know, if there's meetings in your area, if there's local farms that are doing  
**[0:52:50-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:50):**  this, I think a local farmer that is accomplishing what you want to do is one of your best resources.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:52:58):**  If that farmer is willing to talk with you, that would be ideal. Or I'd actually identify,  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:06):**  I'll just say a mentor or someone that you hear about that's doing what you want to accomplish.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:12):**  That's who you want to follow. Follow those who are doing what you want to accomplish,  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:17):**  not saying what you want, but are doing to have a track record. And that's not against people who  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:21):**  aren't happen to be farmers, but and are saying some good things, but I just, you should sift it  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:27):**  through that. And that's a key right there. Now I have seen successful farmers, and I've talked  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:33):**  to a few who have said everything they learned about cover cropping was watching YouTube videos  
**[0:53:38-0:53:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:38):**  on the internet. And I'm not saying that that is right or wrong, but I am saying you have to sift  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:46):**  through what other people are saying from other areas, and what way work on their farm may not  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:51):**  apply to your farm. And sometimes even those of us who speak or those you watch a video, you just  
**[0:53:58-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:53:58):**  can't say everything in that amount of time given to make or almost guarantee success. So yeah,  
**[0:54:05-0:54:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:05):**  there's a lot of options out there for farmers that are just starting out. But I would say  
**[0:54:12-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:12):**  avoid going to, you know, you got to be prudent on how much a new practice you want to do. You  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:19):**  want to make your mistakes small and then build upon them and grow from there.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:22):**  Yeah, I think one of the most valuable things that I ever did was to develop a group of mentors that  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:31):**  kept me on the straight and narrow and got my learning process. It was absolutely invaluable.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:37):**  I owe those people a tremendous thanks. What is the question you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:54:43-0:54:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:43):**  Oh my, well, we've covered pretty much everything. That is a good question, John.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:51):**  You caught me off guard there a little bit. I think we didn't touch a whole lot on the economics,  
**[0:54:58-0:55:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:54:58):**  and maybe that comes to mind because that's a key question that farmers ask. So this all sounds  
**[0:55:06-0:55:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:06):**  great, but how can I do this and survive or flourish even? So I do think that farmers need to  
**[0:55:16-0:55:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:16):**  push the pencil, so to speak, on some of this. Some of these practices are extra, like cover  
**[0:55:24-0:55:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:24):**  crops. There's extra costs in seed and extra costs for driving through the field and planting.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:29):**  And then trying to put numbers to the value that you get out of that. It's a little difficult to  
**[0:55:36-0:55:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:36):**  assign those numbers sometimes. So I guess, yeah, how the economics work out, and I would just  
**[0:55:43-0:55:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:43):**  answer that, that it is something you cannot ignore. So they are very important. And there  
**[0:55:51-0:56:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:55:51):**  are a few good stories out there on the economic value of cover crops. And so there's a couple  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:00):**  resources, not a lot, partly because it's tough to be able to distill down and get some good numbers,  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:06):**  but because it's so subjective. So I guess that's what I'll have to settle on there, John.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:11):**  The economic of this will work if done correctly. Yeah, so let's unravel that just a little bit,  
**[0:56:18-0:56:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:18):**  if we can, from your personal experience. What has been the economic impact in general terms  
**[0:56:24-0:56:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:24):**  on your own operation over the last 20 years since you've been using cover crops? Well, I actually  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:31):**  went back, I didn't go back 20 years, but I went back, I believe it was five years,  
**[0:56:36-0:56:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:36):**  because in the last five years, I have become comfortable to reduce input. So I don't keep track  
**[0:56:45-0:56:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:45):**  of every penny per acre. I'm just not quite that type of farmer. I don't have enough of accounting  
**[0:56:52-0:56:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:52):**  in me, I guess. But I just looked at my schedule F, and I looked at my chemical costs and my  
**[0:56:59-0:57:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:56:59):**  fertilizer costs, because they're a line item on a schedule F for the farmers. And I divided  
**[0:57:06-0:57:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:06):**  that by the amount of acres that I farmed those years, because it changes a little bit. I have  
**[0:57:11-0:57:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:11):**  some rented ground and so forth. And when I looked back five years, my fertilizer went down a little  
**[0:57:22-0:57:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:22):**  over 50%, and my chemicals went down, I think it was 37%. That made me feel good, because I know  
**[0:57:30-0:57:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:30):**  that I'm not done yet. So yeah, to me, that's real numbers. That's on the schedule F. That's what it  
**[0:57:37-0:57:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:37):**  all comes down to. And I'll just say that I get a little annoyed by some proponents of cover crops,  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:44):**  where they will take either one year data of something, or they'll take a fantastic result  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:49):**  and kind of promote it as this is what you can expect all the time. And sometimes farmers are  
**[0:57:55-0:58:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:57:55):**  gullible for that. And sometimes they're like, it's almost not helpful when they're sitting there  
**[0:58:01-0:58:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:01):**  thinking, well, that just can't be true all the time. So I feel, for me, that's reality. Schedule  
**[0:58:07-0:58:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:07):**  F, that shows pretty much what the difference has been. So Steve, if you don't mind sharing,  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:13):**  I'd like to just dig a little bit deeper into that, because we mentioned that you're growing  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:18):**  pumpkins, and I know that you're also growing some broadacre crops, and those numbers can vary quite  
**[0:58:23-0:58:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:23):**  dramatically. I have two follow-up questions. One of them is, what was the cost of achieving those  
**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:30):**  results? What was the cost in cover crop applications, feeding and so forth? And second  
**[0:58:35-0:58:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:35):**  was, can you give us a general approximation or range when you talk about 50% reduction  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:41):**  in fertilizer costs? If you're growing corn, that might be $40 an acre, and if you're growing  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:46):**  pumpkins, it might be $400 an acre. So I'm just trying to get a sense of approximately where that  
**[0:58:50-0:58:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:50):**  was. Well, again, I'm going to, like I said, I was using those broad numbers there, and I did not  
**[0:58:56-0:59:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:58:56):**  look at my cover crop costs as far as on that side of the equation. And I'll just mention this.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:03):**  It kind of is a part of this question here. I am now trying to grow as many cover crop seeds as I  
**[0:59:09-0:59:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:09):**  can for my use. Some of them are difficult to grow here. So that's also a cost savings for me  
**[0:59:16-0:59:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:16):**  on the expense side of the ledger book. So just the fact of growing your own cover, which I would  
**[0:59:23-0:59:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:23):**  encourage farmers to do if they can. And some are relatively easy to grow. But to your point,  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:29):**  what I found on corn, let's just use that. And again, I'm going to have to give you some general  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:33):**  numbers here. I cannot give you exact numbers. As I said earlier, I'm not that good of an accountant  
**[0:59:39-0:59:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:39):**  on my own farm. But I can grow corn sometimes when I have a really nice legume cover crop,  
**[0:59:49-0:59:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:49):**  able to get it planted in time in the fall and let it grow long enough in the spring, where I can  
**[0:59:54-1:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=0:59:54):**  just use 60 to 80 pounds of nitrogen instead of 175, 180, or 200, which would be normal in my area  
**[1:00:06-1:00:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:06):**  here. And my field, just so maybe everyone gets a context of that, I do live in Lancaster County,  
**[1:00:12-1:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:12):**  Pennsylvania, but I'm in the River Hills section of it. So the River Hills. And my average corn  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:19):**  yield is between 185 and 200. So not as good as some areas, that's for sure. So just to give you  
**[1:00:25-1:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:25):**  a little perspective there. So there are times though, when I'm planting my corn into like a  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:33):**  cereal rye cover crop where I cannot reduce it that much because the cereal rye takes up more  
**[1:00:38-1:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:38):**  nitrogen. As far as pumpkins go, when I can grow a nice cover crop of Hairy Vets critical, I can  
**[1:00:46-1:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:46):**  cut my nitrogen rate in half the pumpkins instead of 90 pounds per acre, I can go down to 45,  
**[1:00:52-1:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:52):**  50 pounds per acre because the Hairy Vets is providing that. And as far as phosphorus goes,  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:00:58):**  we talk about some of the nutrients, my soils are high in phosphorus, I never apply phosphorus.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:05):**  I will sometimes put some potassium on in the pumpkin cycle because they can use that.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:12):**  Although that's something I've been looking at a little bit more here recently. So I don't know  
**[1:01:18-1:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:18):**  if I'm answering your questions, I don't know if I have enough real good data to actually answer  
**[1:01:23-1:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:23):**  specifically your questions on that as far as how I'm reducing fertilizer and or reducing costs  
**[1:01:33-1:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:33):**  associated with this system of the added expense of using the cover crop and so forth. But that's  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:01:38):**  just a little bit of a, I guess an overview. Great, well thank you for sharing that. Steve,

**[1:02:24-1:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:24):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  
**[1:02:31-1:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:31):**  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops. We also believe that healthy plants  
**[1:02:37-1:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:37):**  are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants, we must first think  
**[1:02:42-1:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:42):**  differently about agriculture, about empowering life instead of suppressing life, about regeneration  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:48):**  instead of degeneration. To achieve this, we formulate and sell products that help growers  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/erosion-soil-balance-and-cover-crops-with-steve-groff/#t=1:02:54):**  produce higher quality yield with less risk of crop failure. In short, we help growers make more

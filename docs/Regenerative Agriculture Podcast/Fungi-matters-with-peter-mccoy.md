### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-10-17)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission  to have these regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which  all other growing systems are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:14):**  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media  or email me, john at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.

**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:31):**  Greetings friends.  Welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  I'm really excited with the guest we have today,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:37):**  Peter McCoy, the founder of MycoLogos,  the country's first mycology teaching school  where Peter describes how to grow fungi  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:49):**  and how to introduce them into our ecosystems.  Peter is also the author of a really incredible  fungi textbook titled Radical Mycology.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:58):**  Peter, we're very excited to have you here with us today.  Thank you for joining us.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:04):**  Thanks for having me on.  I'm excited to dive into the often overlooked aspects  of fungi in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:13):**  Peter, you've done some very interesting work  with fungi over the last decade or more.  Can you tell us a little bit about the pathway  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:20):**  and the journey that you've been on?  What has brought you to this point?  And can you describe for us a little bit  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:24):**  about the work that you're doing today?  Sure.  So I picked up an interest in mycology  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:31):**  when I was a teenager, about 15 or so.  And it was among my many other interests,  kind of a random hobby and curiosity  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:40):**  that essentially over the years always stayed  high on my list of interests and other things came and went.  But as with many other people,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:48):**  as you start to learn about this quite interesting science,  you kind of can't let it go because it's so intriguing,  so fascinating, so unusual, but also very important,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:58):**  not only in the environment,  fungi are ecologically significant in many aspects,  but also the implications for what applied mycology offers  
**[0:03:07-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:07):**  for humans and human design systems, food systems,  building systems, societal organizational systems.  And all those points of interest really stood out to me  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:18):**  back then and over the years,  what I came to realize was that even though for me,  this topic was clearly quite interesting and important,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:25):**  most of the folks that I would meet and friends and family  didn't know how to relate to the topic.  And essentially I came to realize that that was just because  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:33):**  they hadn't read what I had read.  They didn't learn about this in school.  As I came to realize, I had never learned about it in school  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:39):**  and over the years I came to realize that mycology  is incredibly significant,  but most people just don't know about it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:45):**  And when I was in my mid early twenties,  I kind of made a conscious choice to essentially start to  advocate for mycology and to help educate other people  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:55):**  to show them what they've been missing out on,  to sort of bring a spotlight onto this overlooked topic that  as one of our youngest natural sciences has just not been  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:04):**  able to get a strong footing and get a good break,  I guess, in the education system.  And it's sort of been overlooked in so many ways.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:10):**  So, so that started when I was in my early twenties  with a couple of friends kind of started this,  this grassroots group we called radical mycology,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:17):**  kind of a ragtag approach to saying mushrooms and fungi  are really cool.  And here's all the ways that they are cool to you.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:25):**  And that hooked and sunk into a number of people,  but we, it was sort of a few introductory topics  is where it started.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:32):**  But as the years progressed and as I learned more  and as I met more people and intentionally brought  my knowledge of fungi to organizations and groups  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:40):**  and demographics that I went into knowing that they probably  knew very little about fungi,  I started to learn how they would adapt this knowledge  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:48):**  and new insights would come to me about,  as I learned about different aspects of society and culture,  et cetera, that this topic, mycology applies to,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:56):**  to everything.  And sometimes again, and really profound  and unexplored ways.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:01):**  So it was, it's been sort of an evolving dialogue  that I've tried to contribute to, but also, you know,  learning from over the years and actively trying to evolve  
**[0:05:09-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:09):**  through articulating and broadening horizons  that have essentially been unexplored in human history.  So that organization sort of helped get the word out.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:20):**  I like to think of radical mycology,  which is still quite active as an advocacy organization  and sort of our culture creation around fungi appreciation.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:29):**  And that was so successful or our work there has been  so effective that several years ago,  I wrote a book by the same name called Radical Mycology  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:36):**  that basically puts all these big ideas on paper  and these skills.  Most of the book is a hands-on and how to reference book.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:43):**  And then that did so well as a book that essentially  I'm working to translate those offerings  into even more in-depth online courses,  
**[0:05:51-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:51):**  really going quite deep into fungal ecology, cultivation,  what's known as micro remediation or applying fungi  to mitigate pollution, natural medicine making,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:00):**  and many other aspects of all that fungi offer,  starting with online courses, as I say,  but then also expanding in-person offerings  
**[0:06:08-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:08):**  in Portland, Oregon, where I'm based  and eventually abroad as well.  So it's essentially the first mycology-focused school  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:16):**  really ever in the world.  There are other online courses you might come across,  short introductions to things, of course,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:21):**  and different universities offer varying degrees  of mycology education, but nothing like this  has ever really existed where it's very in-depth,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:29):**  really not only teaching what's known,  but courses will be sculpted in a way that will enable  and inspire, hopefully, and empower the students  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:38):**  to actively contribute to the growth of the science.  One of the great things about mycology is that  being so young and with so little known,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:46):**  there's many, many ways that the average person  can actively contribute to its growth  and come up with even simple applications,  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:55):**  again, even in the regenerative agricultural fields,  especially, that have yet to be explored  because we just need more hands on deck  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:02):**  to put all these ideas to practice.  So that's always been my greatest interest  is enabling that growth of the science,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:09):**  sort of, again, starting with an advocacy  and now just getting personally better at educating  and articulating what can be complex ideas  
**[0:07:16-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:16):**  for the beginner into frameworks and approaches  that are very relatable and contextualized.  I'm very excited that you are starting this school  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:26):**  and I would encourage all of our listeners  to do some more research,  look at the work that Peter is doing,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:31):**  look at the work that other people have done,  get the book, read the book as we go through  this conversation, I'm sure you're going to discover  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:37):**  some of the reasons why it is so important  for us to understand fungi better.  So, Peter, perhaps to begin,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:44):**  I'd love to ask you the question,  particularly within the domain of regenerative agriculture  and agricultural ecosystems in general,  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:51):**  there is a growing awareness of the value  of some types of symbiotic fungi,  particularly mycorrhizal fungi,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:00):**  people are gaining an appreciation for trichoderma  and perhaps a few other fungi,  but by and large, there hasn't really been any adoption  
**[0:08:08-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:08):**  or any in-depth understanding of why fungi are important  and how we can manage them.  And so the question that I'd love to begin with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:18):**  is why are fungi important in agricultural ecosystems  other than just mycorrhizal fungi?  Well, when we look at fungi in an ecological context,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:27):**  they are nature's greatest chemists.  And on the one end, they're the grand disassemblers  and decomposers able to break down wood  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:37):**  and seemingly almost anything humans create as well,  from toxic chemicals to, you know,  for varying degrees even plastics we're now finding.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:43):**  So they're great at breaking things down.  And that of course leads to soil building  and overall soil health.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:49):**  But then as the mycorrhizae redistribute nutrients as well  as part of their roles as chemists,  and they actually solubilize nutrients out of the soil  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:57):**  and feed them to plants and dose them out  in a way that is not as wasteful, of course,  is applying soluble liquid-based fertilizers  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:05):**  as the other approach to feeding plants.  And then even inside of plants, all plants are permeated,  we believe, you know, essentially 100% of their tissues  
**[0:09:13-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:13):**  are from roots to leaf tip with internal fungi  that are known as endophytic fungi  and are likely contributing to varying degrees,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:22):**  big question marks loom here,  but I would bet good money that they're influencing  essentially the immune system of the plant,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:29):**  helping protect against invading fungi,  pathogenic fungi, insect herbivory,  perhaps to some degree sort of stimulating  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:37):**  the immune response in plants  and just enabling to survive droughts  and high temperatures.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:43):**  And this we do know in some instances to be true,  and also even producing some of the medicinal compounds  in plants and the perhaps some of the nutritional profiling  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:50):**  of plants is influenced by the health and chemical  manipulations, if you will,  that these internal fungi are offering.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:57):**  So they're doing so much to move nutrients in the world.  And that's just a quick snapshot of all that they do.  So, you know, so much of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:06-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:06):**  or life in general, we're concerned about our NPKs  and all the other minerals and elements of life  and making sure that they're distributed and moving around.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:16):**  In natural systems, fungi are key players in that  on many, many fronts.  And just that awareness I think is often overlooked,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:23):**  again, primarily just due to a lack of education,  not because people don't care,  it's just that we don't get told  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:30):**  or we don't learn early on or don't learn in depth  even if we obtain higher education in environmental studies,  often fungi are just sort of overlooked  
**[0:10:37-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:37):**  or very poorly acknowledged.  So with that sort of that blind spot being pointed out,  we can reposition our paradigms a bit  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:46):**  by considering fungi from a new light.  You know, in my mind, which is a bit biased,  I'm always thinking about fungi first  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:53):**  in any ecological context  and also in a human designed context, you know,  how do fungi influence the system?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:00):**  How could they be brought in to influence the system?  What of the many different ecological functions  they perform could be incorporated to support  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:08):**  and enhance what I'm already working on or designing  to make the system more holistic, more closed loop.  You know, fungi are the loop closers  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:16):**  in especially nutrient cycling  and through their decomposition rules  as just powerhouse disassemblers.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:22):**  And I mean, just on that front alone,  they could be substantially beneficial  in top soil building and the breakdown of almost any,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:31):**  you know, woody debris or agricultural residue  that isn't really good fodder,  maybe isn't even possible to be fed to animals as is,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:39):**  but you can grow decomposing fungi,  whether or not they produce mushrooms,  of course, edible mushrooms,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:44):**  of course, that's a benefit as well.  And then they break down the material  and very likely, or depending on the species of mushroom,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:50):**  the leftover of that fungal fermentation  of that agricultural waste actually has become  a viable fodder for an animal.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:58):**  And it's protein infused with the fungal tissue  and the fungus might've broken down, say tannins,  if they were in the material  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:04):**  that the animal couldn't tolerate before that.  And that's just one example of how we can,  by incorporating the skillset of cultivating fungi  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:12):**  and awareness and appreciation  and bringing that skillset into, again,  holistic farm or just nutrient management,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:20):**  resource management strategy,  fungi can close a pretty big gap that may be existing.  And then of course, it's just gonna depend  
**[0:12:26-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:26):**  on a given situation, a given crop or farmland  or design how fungi may fit in to a significant degree  or to a minor degree.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:35):**  The two sort of broad groups you mentioned,  the trichoderma molds have been well-studied for decades  and are quite appreciated overseas,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:41):**  especially say in India,  they're much more commonly applied to root systems  to protect against pathogens or to compost piles  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:49):**  to speed up the breakdown.  But it just hasn't gotten over here as quick,  but we're starting to catch up in the West,  
**[0:12:55-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:55):**  generally speaking, Asian cultures  and down in Southeast Asia and things as well,  the appreciation and awareness of mushrooms especially,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:04):**  but other fungi is much more ingrained in the culture  and moldy foods, there are certain moldy foods  that are central to the cuisine of say China and Japan.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:15):**  Miso and soy sauce, these are products of a mold,  essentially, the culture relationship is just so different  and let alone the mushroom consumption.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:22):**  In the West, we have an aversion to fungi  that dates back 100, 200 years  and is a bit outdated nowadays,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:30):**  but still looms and has kept us distanced.  And as awareness grows, as education spreads  and excitement around all the fungi seem to offer  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:39):**  becomes more available,  then we're gonna start to have that critical mass  and that sea change of awareness.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:45):**  And in my hope, really one day,  that consideration of fungi first will play into  so much of our ecological and environmental education  
**[0:13:54-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:54):**  and as practitioners are planning.  I really do feel as strongly that fungi  are such critical keystone components of any ecosystem  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:03):**  that they need to be much more central to our paradigms.  That's not to dismiss the bacterial players  and everything else of course,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:10):**  it's just can't overlook one of the biggest branches  in the tree of life.  I asked you why fungi other than mycorrhizae  
**[0:14:17-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:17):**  and Trichoderma are also important and you, my goodness,  the key pieces that you mentioned, bioremediation,  nutrient transport, immune reactions, drought stress,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:28):**  moisture use efficiency, nutrient transportation,  those are, I feel like we could speak about  each one of those topics in and of itself  
**[0:14:35-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:35):**  for quite an extended period.  So I know that one of the major interests  that the growers have today we're experiencing,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:45):**  we just have vagaries of the weather,  we don't have a climate anymore.  A major concern for many growers is developing  
**[0:14:51-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:51):**  more drought resilient crops and being able to  survive drought stress and be more moisture efficient.  Could you expand for just a little bit on  
**[0:15:01-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:01):**  how fungi can help do that work better?  Well, the easier answers are the more straightforward  and familiar ones is building lots of good topsoil  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:11):**  that can hold more water, good structure,  good humus content and fungi play into that  as I've sort of mentioned.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:19):**  One of the categories of mycorrhizal fungi,  there are seven categories we recognize  and one of those categories are the more commonly  
**[0:15:26-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:26):**  appreciated agricultural mycorrhizae  and these are known as arbuscular mycorrhizae  and they produce a protein called glomalin  
**[0:15:35-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:35):**  that takes essentially the micro aggregates  of soil particles that bacteria essentially produce  through their biofilm and they aggregate those smaller bits  
**[0:15:44-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:44):**  into larger aggregates and that's really what makes  the true tilth and the larger structured porosity  of good soil with good drainage but also  
**[0:15:53-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:53):**  good water holding capacity as well.  It's actually a significant contributor to calcium sinking  is not only that compound which is very stable  
**[0:16:02-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:02):**  and high in carbon itself but also the fungal tissue  is very high in carbon and is essentially  the primary translator of atmospheric CO2  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:12):**  via the plant but actually sinking it to the soil  is primarily done with fungal mycelium  and the exudates they release.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:18):**  So that's sort of a tangential aspect  maybe of climate variations is the CO2 sinking  but as far as tolerating drought and mitigating those  
**[0:16:27-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:27):**  impacts, helping the plant's root system  be more resilient in various ways  and also just holding more nutrients, more water  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:36):**  through good soil, these mycorrhizae will help  certainly in that capacity and then the decomposers  as I've said will just contribute to your other  
**[0:16:43-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:43):**  composting processes to just speed up soil building.  You know shading and all this can't really be done  by fungi so they're just contributing to the growth  
**[0:16:53-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:53):**  of higher canopies to try to mitigate heat and things  but the other aspects of their building soil  is reducing erosion through this stabilizing  
**[0:17:03-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:03):**  they perform not only with the glues  but also the tissue itself, this network of fungal tissue  in the soil will help hold it together and produce,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:11):**  reduce rather the erosion that can lead to desertification  caused by high heat.  And so those are sort of the more straightforward approaches  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:19):**  you know ultimately they are the grand solution  for this really major global issue of course  but they can help again alleviate some of the stress  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:27):**  on the plant by supporting essentially the plant's  own immune system.  The fungi I mentioned a couple minutes ago  
**[0:17:32-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:32):**  that have been shown to reduce stress and heat  and drought tolerance from inside of the plant.  Those have been isolated from plants found in say  
**[0:17:41-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:41):**  thermal pools near volcanically active areas,  really hot water that the plant shouldn't be able  to tolerate yet this fungus enables it to tolerate  
**[0:17:51-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:51):**  is one example and they've isolated those fungi  I've identified them from within the plant  and there is some research looking into say applying  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:59):**  those fungi to other plants to try to confer  this drought tolerance and heat tolerance.  My concern there always as a word of caution  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:06):**  is just that we don't know the long term effects of that  and that could actually potentially have a negative impact  on the other natural or native internal fungi  
**[0:18:14-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:14):**  in that new host plant and there could be unforeseen  ecological effects and effects on the plant's overall health  by sort of shifting this internal fungal population  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:24):**  to try to bring about drought resistance  if that makes sense.  So it's a little bit of you know going beyond  
**[0:18:30-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:30):**  our field of awareness and sort of shooting blindly.  So rather than taking that approach which is not something  I advocate, it's more about trying to build  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:39):**  more resilient crops if possible and then just providing  what they need to deal with the heat in general  of shade and water.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:47):**  You've mentioned a couple of pieces which I think  are important to follow up on a bit.  One of them being the humification process,  
**[0:18:56-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:56):**  carbon sequestration, carbon sinking.  There's getting to be a much better understanding  that the really important work of carbon sequestration  
**[0:19:05-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:05):**  happens when you have plants that are photosynthesizing  really well and transmitting an abundant quantity of sugars  out through the root systems as root exudates.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:14):**  And I think from that point once we have root exudates,  that's where the conversation starts becoming really muddy  about different roles of fungi versus bacteria, et cetera  
**[0:19:25-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:25):**  and there's a substantial lack of clarity  around the role of fungi in producing stable humic  substances and stable soil aggregates.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:34):**  So what is the value and the importance of fungi in,  I know you mentioned this and already described it  to some degree but what is the function of fungi  
**[0:19:43-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:43):**  relative to bacteria and how can we improve the function  of fungal populations in our agricultural soils?  Well it's certainly an ecology down there  
**[0:19:56-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:56):**  so everything is sort of working together.  One good example of a strong fungal bacteria relationship  plant producers might be interested in is the exchange  
**[0:20:06-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:06):**  between rhizobia, nitrogen fixing bacteria  and the arbuscular mycorrhizae that I was just talking about  so there's actually in natural systems  
**[0:20:15-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:15):**  it's a three-way exchange and we might try to bring in  rhizobia or even inoculate our leguminous plants with them  but we would also benefit to bring in these AM fungi.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:25):**  They work synergistically where the fungi are bringing in  elements that the plant can then use  to then feed the rhizobia so the enzymes that fix nitrogen  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:34):**  are produced and active and then it feeds back to the plant  which then feeds back to the fungus  that's attached to the plant  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:40):**  so the three of them work together.  The mycelium travels as a network  and for folks that aren't familiar  
**[0:20:47-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:47):**  these fungi clamp on a plant roots and extend into the soil  essentially increasing the surface area  of the plant's own root system 10 to a thousand fold.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:56):**  The fungal tissue is much thinner in diameter  and can travel faster and can do a lot of chemistry  essentially that the plant never evolved to do.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:04):**  The exudates they release is primarily to attract fungi  and bacteria helpers both for nutrient provision  and also for defense that especially the fungi provide.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:16):**  So the plant is providing these exudates yes  but that goes on to feed the other microbes  that actually do much of the work in the soil  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:23):**  but then also a lot to sink it especially via the fungi  as I mentioned with their tissue and their own exudates.  We need all these players together  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:31):**  in a long-term soil succession.  Soils of course become more fungal dominant  with a complex of especially ectomycorrhizal mushrooms  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:40):**  that come typically with more tree crops  in an established forest.  And in agricultural setting you know  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:45):**  you're not really gonna be able to accomplish that as much.  You're more trying to bring in whichever mycorrhizae  are known to associate with whatever plants you work with.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:54):**  And if it's annuals or perennial shrubs or something  it's probably gonna be more the arbusculomycorrhizae.  These are non-mushroom forming fungi  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:02):**  as opposed to what I just mentioned.  The ectomycorrhizae these are the mushroom formers,  mushroom and truffle formers in our forests.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:08):**  Those are much more difficult to establish in an orchard  as probably orchards who've looked into trying to grow  say chanterelles might know.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:15):**  But there are these other fungi we can bring in.  And the dynamics between the different communities  you know in my opinion also isn't as well studied  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:24):**  as it could be.  Most of the emphasis has gone towards  looking at the bacterial players  
**[0:22:29-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:29):**  noting when certain types of fungi might indicate problems  or just many are lumped together essentially as bad fungi.  And you know some writings you'll read.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:38):**  But the honest truth is that our understanding  of soil fungi is very cursory.  We've identified certain types of mycorrhizae  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:45):**  that are beneficial.  And of the many that are out there  there's about 300 especially these ectomycorrhizae.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:51):**  Only a couple dozen are really appreciated  from a cultivation standpoint  primarily because they establish well  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:57):**  through our human endeavors.  Many won't establish, won't regenerate from spore.  We don't know why yet.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:03):**  So there's only a handful that we commonly find  in inoculum products  because they're more guaranteed to work.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:10):**  And even among them certain species  have been highlighted more.  But that's just a small, small piece  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:14):**  of all the fungi that are out there.  There's many types of molds and yeast  and other types of fungi called chytrids  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:21):**  say that are in soils.  And though we can name many of them at this point  we know very little about their ecological role  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:28):**  other than saying they're a decomposer,  they eat keratin, they eat chitin,  they eat certain things, they eat pollen.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:34):**  But how does that really ripple out  and connect to everything?  And what's a good design system  
**[0:23:38-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:38):**  that brings all the pieces together thanks to fungi?  I mean, we're far from having a clear plan for that.  What I gravitate towards more and appreciate more  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:49):**  is the sort of Korean natural farming approach  bringing in, they say indigenous microorganisms  but it's really like indigenous molds  
**[0:23:55-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:55):**  essentially indigenous fungi  where you go to a relatively healthy forest system  bring some rice, some partially cooked rice  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:04):**  let it sit out for several days or weeks  and mold will just naturally grow on it  from the surrounding airflow.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:10):**  And you bring back that moldy rice  and essentially mix it into your soil  through a series of dilutions.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:15):**  And the thought is you're just trying to bring back  fungal diversity.  You could, if you were a mycologist, look under scope  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:20):**  and try to figure out which ones you're actually bringing in  but it's a bit more, you know  just letting nature take its course  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:25):**  and just trying to bring back fungal diversity in general.  Because through all of our human endeavors  and disturbance of soil on so many fronts,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:33):**  it's very likely, I mean, it's certain  that we've lost innumerable fungi  whether they're now extinct through human activity  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:42):**  in certain parts of the world perhaps  or just their population.  And certainly diversity is gonna be significantly repressed.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:49):**  And even some of the best, you know  organic farms or things or even no-till farms  where they try to not disturb the soil microbes  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:56):**  if those fungi are absent  it's gonna take a very long time for them to come back.  So you're trying to speed that up  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:01):**  trying to bring back that natural diversity  say through the Korean natural farming method  is one approach with the thought, with the hope  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:08):**  that it will all sort of balance itself out in the long run.  You know, some people like that  some people don't, cause it's not as precise  
**[0:25:15-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:15):**  but the reality of where our knowledge is with soil fungi  and the right approaches is sort of there at this moment.  Again, as I said earlier, we need more hands on deck  
**[0:25:24-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:24):**  just trying different approaches, especially in this front.  To your point that we don't really understand the role  and know a lot about what these different fungal populations  
**[0:25:35-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:35):**  are doing, we had an experience a couple of years ago  working with mycorrhizal fungi  where we're working with a spinach crop  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:45):**  with soils that are very saline soils  very high sodium content.  And we're adding bicoron inoculants  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:51):**  in an effort to sequester some of the sodium  and take it out of the system, which historically  in other operations has been very successful.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:58):**  And on this farm, we're not getting the results  that we are used to observing.  So we added a mycorrhizal fungi inoculant  
**[0:26:08-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:08):**  and voila, we get this tremendous  sodium sequestration response.  Even though spinach is supposedly not  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:16):**  a mycorrhizal symbiotic crop,  yet we got a very strong soil remediation effect  of the high concentrations of sodium.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:24):**  So I think that's just one little example  of something that we observed and experienced  that was counter to what we think we may know  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:35):**  about these organisms.  Yeah, I mean, that's all those types of examples  and taking a chance is really where it's at  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:43):**  with especially applied mycology.  It's a bit like the wild west  where there's just a lot of unexplored terrain.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:50):**  And it's one of those things too  where unfortunately maybe some things have been done  say in Japan or in China where much more research  
**[0:26:56-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:56):**  has gone into some of these applications  but perhaps the papers haven't been translated  into English or they're just of course hard to access.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:05):**  There is a lot of good knowledge out there  with mycological fungi related experiments  that have been done in many different capacities  
**[0:27:13-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:13):**  but they're sort of buried if you will in the literature  and again, many are not translated.  So in the Western world, in the English speaking world  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:23):**  and also just in a different sort of cultural context  I guess and maybe different approach  than maybe is happening in other parts of the world.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:29):**  Taking what is known and as you say,  both trying new things, trying things  that maybe aren't even supposed to work  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:35):**  or even just taking what's supposed to work  and then seeing how it really plays out  in your soil and your climate,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:40):**  building up this local awareness.  I mean, just as we have with many different plant crops  and different regional farming associations  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:47):**  where you can get that local knowledge  of how things have played out over the centuries or decades,  we don't have that with fungi.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:53):**  I mean, we have to start somewhere.  Of course, trying with the best starting point  but also not being afraid to branch out.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:59):**  I mean, I've done many things personally  with mushroom cultivation.  So more just a standard indoor approach, I guess,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:05):**  to growing mushrooms.  But even in that arena,  there's so much room for innovation still  
**[0:28:10-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:10):**  and I've intentionally done many things  that weren't supposed to work and got them to work.  And my interest nowadays is more going  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:18):**  into these broader applications,  these larger scale ecological approaches  to working with fungi, both for sort of human endeavors,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:27):**  human labors, but also for just general  environmental restoration on many fronts.  And there we have very few anecdotes.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:34):**  The field is wide open, which is exciting  but also a bit intimidating depending on how you look at it.  But yeah, I mean, that anecdote is something I'll hold on to  
**[0:28:44-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:44):**  for sure and probably share it in the future.  There is a growing desire and a growing conversation,  particularly in the domain of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:28:54-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:54):**  to develop what are termed disease suppressive soils,  soils which actively antagonize the development  of pathogenic communities.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:05):**  There's two questions that are tied to disease suppression.  One of them is how can we develop all the communities  that will contribute to disease suppression?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:14):**  And secondly, there seems to be an inverse relationship  between disease suppressive soils  and soils that have had a historical accumulation  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:25):**  of pesticide applications.  So there's kind of two parts to that ecosystem.  One is we need to bioremediate  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:33):**  some of the toxin applications  and also hopefully help to shift the fungal population  in that soil profile to develop a much more  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:40):**  disease suppressive soil.  How can growers manage fungi and use fungi  to achieve some of those benefits?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:47):**  Yeah, it sounds like a one, two fungal punch, if you will,  where the problem perhaps is the severe disturbance  of the soil through tillage,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:59):**  again, the loss of microbial diversity,  especially fungal diversity through all that's been done  to stress the soil along with the chemical application.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:09):**  And if that is still suppressing fungi from returning,  they're not able to do essentially  what I see all fungi do, broadly speaking,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:17):**  which is essentially balance the ecosystem  and hear the ecosystem of the soil.  You maybe don't have many important players represented.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:24):**  And so what we consider pathogenic organisms predominate,  things that are able to tolerate  and they're not being suppressed or sort of checked  
**[0:30:32-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:32):**  and balanced by controlled mechanisms like fungi.  So the remediation and the breakdown of chemical pollutants  in soil is one of the applications of fungal remediation  
**[0:30:43-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:43):**  or micoremediation that is a bit more  of a lower hanging fruit than some of the other applications.  There's a number of ways fungi can deal with pollutants  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:50):**  in the soil and in water systems,  but some are though interesting, quite inaccessible  to even advanced practitioners  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:57):**  without some heavy duty equipment or expensive equipment.  But to deal with what you're describing  is actually a bit approachable.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:03):**  In essence, if the chemical contaminant is known,  there are a series of steps a cultivator practitioner  can go through to determine which fungus,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:14):**  often it's a mushroom, but it can be a mold  that is tolerant of that compound  and perhaps quite capable of breaking it down  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:23):**  and degrading it essentially as a food source.  And there's even more advanced methods  that can be done to what we say train  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:29):**  or acclimate the fungus to eat that  and tolerate that compound.  So you can develop an organism that is targeted  
**[0:31:36-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:36):**  to this contaminant of this pollutant in your soil system.  Once that's been done, the mycelium can be bulked up  into large, large quantities  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:45):**  and then mass applied into the soil.  This might be one of those instances  where the soil needs to be excavated  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:51):**  to really infuse the mycelium throughout it  and also to provide good airflow so it can breathe  while it does its work of growing through that pollution  
**[0:31:59-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:59):**  and breaking it down, hopefully to tolerable levels  or below sort of effective levels.  Once that's done, then it gets put back into place.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:08):**  And then now the soil perhaps has been heavily disturbed  through even additional excavation.  So the biology needs to be brought up real quick  
**[0:32:15-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:15):**  through these different mycorrhizal and other fungal  inoculums, other microbial inoculums, compost, compost tea.  I mean, I'm a fan of all of it using sort of the best  
**[0:32:25-0:32:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:25):**  approach that the grower has available to provide.  You know, the mediation of chemically polluted soil  is actually an approach that could be done  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:35):**  by a local grower or even a really dedicated farmer  who wants to learn these skills.  It does take time, is the drawback.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:43):**  The whole time you're sort of waiting for months,  not sure if it's really gonna work.  So there's that sort of anxiety that might come with it.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:50):**  And then there's some suggested costs,  additional cost of testing and perhaps doing a number  of tests to ensure that it's really breaking down  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:57):**  before, during and after the experiment runs  and those tests add up.  So those are some of the barriers,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:03):**  but if a given farmer or landowner wants to take  that approach to really deal with their acreage  and if it goes well, it might very well be successful  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:11):**  within several months.  You know, there's a lot of variables, but it's not impossible  and then the soil is essentially cleaned  
**[0:33:17-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:17):**  of this major prohibitor of beneficial life,  really building out the quality of the soil that's desired  and then sort of the more familiar approaches  
**[0:33:26-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:26):**  can be attempted after that.  Peter, there is so much that we don't know  about the types of fungi that we might desire.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:35):**  You described the Asian approach of just adapting  to what is present in the local environment.  How would implementing this process that you're describing  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:47):**  look like on scale?  Is it practical to apply on a larger scale,  on a scale of a thousand acres or more?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:53):**  And if so, what would it look like?  Can you kind of walk us through the process a little bit  just on a very high level?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:00):**  It is scalable.  You can start with the harder ones  and maybe go to the easier one.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:04):**  So it ends on a good note, if you will.  Probably the less accessible approach would be trying  to chemically or remediate chemically polluted soils  
**[0:34:12-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:12):**  that span acres or even hectares.  However large, because you're essentially trying  to collect that soil, gather it and inoculate it,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:22):**  roughly 20 to 30% of its entire volume  should be this fungal inoculum.  This mushroom usually is what's often used  
**[0:34:28-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:28):**  in these instances.  To grow that out, whether onsite or to commission  a local grower or another grower somewhere in the country,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:38):**  to produce that, I mean, it really adds up both  with the volume of that inoculum to bring in,  the mixing it in, the weighting,  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:46):**  and then also even providing shade  so that the material doesn't grow out,  or at least keeping it moist.  
**[0:34:51-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:51):**  The fungus needs to stay moist while it grows.  So it is scalable, but it's just quite a large endeavor.  It might be more feasible, manageable to do it  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:00):**  one acre at a time, one half acre at a time.  But if you have an incredibly large operation  that might not play out with a timeline,  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:07):**  so there's that.  Now, so that's the biggest challenge, perhaps,  is really cleaning up large contaminated areas.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:15):**  Generally just bringing in fungal inoculum,  I mean, that can be done many number of ways,  as probably is familiar to a number of the listeners,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:22):**  where a lot of these products that you can either buy  or even create yourself are primarily just fungal spores  of various types or little fragments of their tissue  
**[0:35:33-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:33):**  that are heavily diluted in a carrier,  whether that's, say, clay or any other sort of soil mix.  I mean, if you're already, say, top dressing,  
**[0:35:42-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:42):**  or you can mix it into your compost  if you're gonna be laying that in,  or top dressing again on top of your crop for the year.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:49):**  If you have a mixer, a large soil mixer  or something like that, or whatever your detractor  or machinery that seeds the field, et cetera,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:59):**  these inoculums can be mixed in and diluted.  You only need, in theory, a couple active spores  to really get the job started.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:07):**  So we work in higher numbers to hedge our bets  that by putting out a lot of spores,  we'll get something to take.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:12):**  But at the end of the day, one single, say, mushroom,  or one grow container of arbusculomycorrhizae  might be producing hundreds or more likely thousands,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:23):**  if not tens of thousands, depending on the grow size  of the spores of these fungi  that you really don't need very many of  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:31):**  to start the establishment of a network  throughout your whole field.  So it is doable.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:36):**  Even with the Korean approach that I mentioned,  where you're gathering sort of moldy rice,  it does go through a series of dilutions,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:43):**  and the final product is heavily diluted.  I don't know the numbers I have taught in my head,  but a relatively small amount of the material  
**[0:36:51-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:51):**  can be extensively spread throughout whole orchards.  That is commonly done in Asia, and also in, say, Hawaii,  where these practices have actually become quite popular.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:01):**  So it's not unfeasible,  especially with these microfungi, as we call them,  as opposed to the macro fungi, the mushrooms,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:07):**  which can take quite a bit more to really grow en masse.  Peter, if a grower were to want to learn more  about how to implement these practices and these ideas,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:20):**  obviously there's your own book, Radical Mycology,  and the courses that you're developing,  which I would highly recommend.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:25):**  Are there any other resources or any other books  that you would point people to  that they should look to as an additional resource  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:30):**  for more information and to learn how to implement  and apply these practices and ideas?  Well, the Korean natural farming approach,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:35):**  perhaps one of the easiest approaches  to doing some of what I've described,  because you're essentially just putting moldy rice  
**[0:37:41-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:41):**  into a nearby woodlot forest and letting it get moldy.  The go-to book on that, most people point towards,  is called JADAM, so J-A-D-A-M,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:52):**  Organic Farming by Master Cho.  And that goes through many aspects  of Korean natural farming,  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:58):**  but also gets into these approaches.  The arbusculomycorrhizae,  now you can buy all kinds of products,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:04):**  as I've sort of mentioned, you've mentioned,  but there are techniques to grow onsite and farm scale  amounts of arbusculomycorrhizal inoculum.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:12):**  In short, the methodology was developed  by the Rodale Institute through a seven-year study  and is available online through their website.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:21):**  I synthesize it in my book,  the book, Mycorrhizal Planet by Michael Phillips,  also discusses it and sort of synthesizes it,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:29):**  but it all points back to the Rodale Institute  that did the actual work.  And in essence, you take mycorrhizal spores,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:35):**  whether from a commercial product  or actually just from the top soil of a nearby forest  that's been left undisturbed for several years.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:41):**  And there should be mycorrhizal spores there,  arbusculomycorrhizal spores.  You use those to inoculate some grass or allium starts  
**[0:38:49-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:49):**  or seeds rather in a low nutrient medium.  The plant grows, the roots are starved,  and they will accept the fungus as a partner  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:58):**  to help feed it.  And then you grow out the plant continuously  under low nutrient conditions.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:03):**  And over a series of months, once the plant is big enough  and the fungus network is established in the grow medium,  the fungus will naturally start to produce spores.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:11):**  And then you can harvest the spores  and even the mycelium from that soil  in the following season, dilute it into your compost  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:19):**  or your top dressing soil or what have you  as a way to inoculate.  And this has been designed intentionally by Rodale  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:25):**  for farm scale approach.  So that's a great resource, thanks to them  for their years of researching that.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:31):**  The remediation aspect is quite a bit more technical,  quite a few steps as I've noted.  And of course the details are even finer  
**[0:39:38-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:38):**  once you get into it.  I would say that my book is one that goes  sort of the clearest into detailing those methodologies,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:46):**  really explaining the theory  and the practices and principles.  There are quite a number of other  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:51):**  micro remediation focused textbooks  and technical literature that's out there.  But it's not very accessible and it's not written  
**[0:39:58-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:58):**  with this agricultural context really in mind.  It's more speaking from an objective scientific standpoint,  but it will help explain some of the theory,  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:06):**  the actual application and the how to  is detailed in my book in a way that I have yet to see  produced elsewhere.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:13):**  It's again, as a burgeoning field,  there really is not a lot of literature,  just on mycology in general.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:19):**  Even just good books for the lay person  on any of these aspects, there's very few out there.  It's one of the reasons I wrote my book  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:24):**  is to try to synthesize all these great ideas  that are otherwise hard to find.  But yeah, those are some resources.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:31):**  Good resources.  Thank you, Peter.  We've talked about a lot of different topics.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:35):**  We've covered a lot of territory relatively quickly.  What is the question that you wish I would have asked?  What is something that we haven't yet spoken about  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:42):**  that you believe is very important?  Um, it's a great question.  I mean, the thing that I always think about  
**[0:40:49-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:49):**  and am constantly trying to challenge myself to answer  is how to best spread this knowledge and awareness  around the world as quickly as possible.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:59):**  And that's kind of always been the emphasis of my work.  And I'm just constantly trying to evolve that  or elaborate on better and better ways to do that.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:06):**  And in this context, it's hard for me  to know the best approach really,  because people come at their crop production  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:13):**  and their awareness and appreciation of fungi  from so many different angles  to be able to give the right context  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:20):**  can be a bit of a challenge.  But at the same time, the ability to just communicate it  for any of the listeners, I guess I'm saying,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:27):**  that have started to get a sense  that there is something to this topic,  as I've tried to emphasize.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:32):**  Hopefully they take that deeper into their own knowledge.  And as I teach all my students or say to them  or encourage them to consider,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:41):**  is that thereafter they have been essentially knighted  a fungal ambassador.  And to whatever capacity makes sense  
**[0:41:48-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:48):**  and to whatever social contexts allow,  to not be afraid to share your newfound interest  and knowledge around this is still relatively inaccessible  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:58):**  or more obscure topic.  And there's only so much I, as one person, can do  to spread the word.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:04):**  It's much more powerful when it becomes  sort of a groundswell and essentially a grassroots effort  to bring fungi more to the fore  
**[0:42:12-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:12):**  and to not be afraid to try new things  and all that we've touched on.  I think that that's where it's gonna be the best approach.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:20):**  That includes educating children,  attempting all kinds of methods  to bring it into educational sectors  
**[0:42:25-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:25):**  at every level of education  and with every approach under the sun,  from theater to standup comedy,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:32):**  to going to your local farmers association  and seeking out grant funding  for experimental approaches on your own farm.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:40):**  All these things in the long run will pool together  in probably ways we can't quite imagine  to create in time a greater appreciation  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:48):**  and literacy around fungi in the West  that we have yet to fully embrace.  And that's when things will get interesting.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:54):**  So I just encourage the listener to, again,  not be afraid to dive in,  start looking into any of these topics.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:00):**  And as with many people, perhaps once you start to dive in,  you'll just keep diving deeper and maybe never let it go.  Wonderful.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:09):**  Peter, thank you very much for sharing your thoughts  and your knowledge.  We really appreciate the new information  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:17):**  that you've been able to share with our audience.  So thank you very much for being here  and we look forward to having more conversations  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:21):**  with you in the future.  Yeah, it's been an absolute pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:27):**  Hi, this is Robin.  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:35):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:46):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant  to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  we must first think differently about agriculture,  
**[0:43:55-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:55):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  about regeneration versus degeneration.  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:44:05-0:44:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:05):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  and make more money with less risk.  Thank you for listening.  
**[0:44:41-0:45:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:41):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:46:11-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:46:11):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:47:41-0:48:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:47:41):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:49:11-0:50:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:49:11):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

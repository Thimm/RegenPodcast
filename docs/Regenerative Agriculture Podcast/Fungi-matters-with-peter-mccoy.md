### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 23:29:45)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:46):**  to have these regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:52):**  all other growing systems are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:11):**  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:14):**  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,

**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:31):**  Greetings friends.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:35):**  I'm really excited with the guest we have today,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:37):**  Peter McCoy, the founder of MycoLogos,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:41):**  the country's first mycology teaching school  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:45):**  where Peter describes how to grow fungi  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:49):**  and how to introduce them into our ecosystems.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:52):**  Peter is also the author of a really incredible  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:55):**  fungi textbook titled Radical Mycology.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:58):**  Peter, we're very excited to have you here with us today.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you for joining us.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:03):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:04):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:05):**  I'm excited to dive into the often overlooked aspects  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:09):**  of fungi in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:13):**  Peter, you've done some very interesting work  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:15):**  with fungi over the last decade or more.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:18):**  Can you tell us a little bit about the pathway  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:20):**  and the journey that you've been on?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:21):**  What has brought you to this point?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:23):**  And can you describe for us a little bit  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:24):**  about the work that you're doing today?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:27):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:28):**  So I picked up an interest in mycology  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:31):**  when I was a teenager, about 15 or so.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:34):**  And it was among my many other interests,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:37):**  kind of a random hobby and curiosity  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:40):**  that essentially over the years always stayed  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:43):**  high on my list of interests and other things came and went.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:46):**  But as with many other people,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:48):**  as you start to learn about this quite interesting science,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:51):**  you kind of can't let it go because it's so intriguing,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:54):**  so fascinating, so unusual, but also very important,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:58):**  not only in the environment,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:00):**  fungi are ecologically significant in many aspects,  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:03):**  but also the implications for what applied mycology offers  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:07):**  for humans and human design systems, food systems,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:11):**  building systems, societal organizational systems.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:14):**  And all those points of interest really stood out to me  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:18):**  back then and over the years,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:19):**  what I came to realize was that even though for me,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:22):**  this topic was clearly quite interesting and important,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:25):**  most of the folks that I would meet and friends and family  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:28):**  didn't know how to relate to the topic.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:30):**  And essentially I came to realize that that was just because  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:33):**  they hadn't read what I had read.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:34):**  They didn't learn about this in school.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:36):**  As I came to realize, I had never learned about it in school  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:39):**  and over the years I came to realize that mycology  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:42):**  is incredibly significant,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:43):**  but most people just don't know about it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:45):**  And when I was in my mid early twenties,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:48):**  I kind of made a conscious choice to essentially start to  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:51):**  advocate for mycology and to help educate other people  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:55):**  to show them what they've been missing out on,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:57):**  to sort of bring a spotlight onto this overlooked topic that  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:01):**  as one of our youngest natural sciences has just not been  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:04):**  able to get a strong footing and get a good break,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:07):**  I guess, in the education system.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:08):**  And it's sort of been overlooked in so many ways.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:10):**  So, so that started when I was in my early twenties  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:13):**  with a couple of friends kind of started this,  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:15):**  this grassroots group we called radical mycology,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:17):**  kind of a ragtag approach to saying mushrooms and fungi  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:21):**  are really cool.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:22):**  And here's all the ways that they are cool to you.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:25):**  And that hooked and sunk into a number of people,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:29):**  but we, it was sort of a few introductory topics  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:31):**  is where it started.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:32):**  But as the years progressed and as I learned more  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:35):**  and as I met more people and intentionally brought  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:37):**  my knowledge of fungi to organizations and groups  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:40):**  and demographics that I went into knowing that they probably  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:44):**  knew very little about fungi,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:45):**  I started to learn how they would adapt this knowledge  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:48):**  and new insights would come to me about,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:51):**  as I learned about different aspects of society and culture,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:53):**  et cetera, that this topic, mycology applies to,  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:56):**  to everything.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:57):**  And sometimes again, and really profound  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:59):**  and unexplored ways.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:01):**  So it was, it's been sort of an evolving dialogue  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:03):**  that I've tried to contribute to, but also, you know,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:06):**  learning from over the years and actively trying to evolve  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:09):**  through articulating and broadening horizons  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:12):**  that have essentially been unexplored in human history.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:17):**  So that organization sort of helped get the word out.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:20):**  I like to think of radical mycology,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:22):**  which is still quite active as an advocacy organization  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:24):**  and sort of our culture creation around fungi appreciation.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:29):**  And that was so successful or our work there has been  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:31):**  so effective that several years ago,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:33):**  I wrote a book by the same name called Radical Mycology  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:36):**  that basically puts all these big ideas on paper  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:38):**  and these skills.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:39):**  Most of the book is a hands-on and how to reference book.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:43):**  And then that did so well as a book that essentially  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:46):**  I'm working to translate those offerings  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:48):**  into even more in-depth online courses,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:51):**  really going quite deep into fungal ecology, cultivation,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:55):**  what's known as micro remediation or applying fungi  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:57):**  to mitigate pollution, natural medicine making,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:00):**  and many other aspects of all that fungi offer,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:03):**  starting with online courses, as I say,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:05):**  but then also expanding in-person offerings  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:08):**  in Portland, Oregon, where I'm based  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:10):**  and eventually abroad as well.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:12):**  So it's essentially the first mycology-focused school  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:16):**  really ever in the world.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:17):**  There are other online courses you might come across,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:19):**  short introductions to things, of course,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:21):**  and different universities offer varying degrees  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:24):**  of mycology education, but nothing like this  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:26):**  has ever really existed where it's very in-depth,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:29):**  really not only teaching what's known,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:31):**  but courses will be sculpted in a way that will enable  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:34):**  and inspire, hopefully, and empower the students  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:38):**  to actively contribute to the growth of the science.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:42):**  One of the great things about mycology is that  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:44):**  being so young and with so little known,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:46):**  there's many, many ways that the average person  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:48):**  can actively contribute to its growth  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:51):**  and come up with even simple applications,  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:55):**  again, even in the regenerative agricultural fields,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:58):**  especially, that have yet to be explored  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:00):**  because we just need more hands on deck  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:02):**  to put all these ideas to practice.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:04):**  So that's always been my greatest interest  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:06):**  is enabling that growth of the science,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:09):**  sort of, again, starting with an advocacy  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:11):**  and now just getting personally better at educating  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:14):**  and articulating what can be complex ideas  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:16):**  for the beginner into frameworks and approaches  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:20):**  that are very relatable and contextualized.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:23):**  I'm very excited that you are starting this school  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:26):**  and I would encourage all of our listeners  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:27):**  to do some more research,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:29):**  look at the work that Peter is doing,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:31):**  look at the work that other people have done,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:33):**  get the book, read the book as we go through  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:34):**  this conversation, I'm sure you're going to discover  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:37):**  some of the reasons why it is so important  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:40):**  for us to understand fungi better.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:42):**  So, Peter, perhaps to begin,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:44):**  I'd love to ask you the question,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:46):**  particularly within the domain of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:49):**  and agricultural ecosystems in general,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:51):**  there is a growing awareness of the value  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:55):**  of some types of symbiotic fungi,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:58):**  particularly mycorrhizal fungi,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:00):**  people are gaining an appreciation for trichoderma  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:03):**  and perhaps a few other fungi,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:04):**  but by and large, there hasn't really been any adoption  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:08):**  or any in-depth understanding of why fungi are important  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:13):**  and how we can manage them.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:15):**  And so the question that I'd love to begin with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:18):**  is why are fungi important in agricultural ecosystems  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:21):**  other than just mycorrhizal fungi?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:24):**  Well, when we look at fungi in an ecological context,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:27):**  they are nature's greatest chemists.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:31):**  And on the one end, they're the grand disassemblers  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:34):**  and decomposers able to break down wood  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:37):**  and seemingly almost anything humans create as well,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:39):**  from toxic chemicals to, you know,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:41):**  for varying degrees even plastics we're now finding.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:43):**  So they're great at breaking things down.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:45):**  And that of course leads to soil building  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:47):**  and overall soil health.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:49):**  But then as the mycorrhizae redistribute nutrients as well  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:52):**  as part of their roles as chemists,  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:54):**  and they actually solubilize nutrients out of the soil  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:57):**  and feed them to plants and dose them out  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:00):**  in a way that is not as wasteful, of course,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:02):**  is applying soluble liquid-based fertilizers  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:05):**  as the other approach to feeding plants.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:07):**  And then even inside of plants, all plants are permeated,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:10):**  we believe, you know, essentially 100% of their tissues  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:13):**  are from roots to leaf tip with internal fungi  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:17):**  that are known as endophytic fungi  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:20):**  and are likely contributing to varying degrees,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:22):**  big question marks loom here,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:24):**  but I would bet good money that they're influencing  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:27):**  essentially the immune system of the plant,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:29):**  helping protect against invading fungi,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:32):**  pathogenic fungi, insect herbivory,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:35):**  perhaps to some degree sort of stimulating  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:37):**  the immune response in plants  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:38):**  and just enabling to survive droughts  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:41):**  and high temperatures.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:43):**  And this we do know in some instances to be true,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:45):**  and also even producing some of the medicinal compounds  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:47):**  in plants and the perhaps some of the nutritional profiling  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:50):**  of plants is influenced by the health and chemical  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:55):**  manipulations, if you will,  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:56):**  that these internal fungi are offering.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:57):**  So they're doing so much to move nutrients in the world.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:01):**  And that's just a quick snapshot of all that they do.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:04):**  So, you know, so much of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:06):**  or life in general, we're concerned about our NPKs  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:10):**  and all the other minerals and elements of life  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:13):**  and making sure that they're distributed and moving around.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:16):**  In natural systems, fungi are key players in that  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:18):**  on many, many fronts.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:20):**  And just that awareness I think is often overlooked,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:23):**  again, primarily just due to a lack of education,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:26):**  not because people don't care,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:28):**  it's just that we don't get told  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:30):**  or we don't learn early on or don't learn in depth  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:32):**  even if we obtain higher education in environmental studies,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:35):**  often fungi are just sort of overlooked  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:37):**  or very poorly acknowledged.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:40):**  So with that sort of that blind spot being pointed out,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:43):**  we can reposition our paradigms a bit  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:46):**  by considering fungi from a new light.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:49):**  You know, in my mind, which is a bit biased,  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:51):**  I'm always thinking about fungi first  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:53):**  in any ecological context  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:55):**  and also in a human designed context, you know,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:58):**  how do fungi influence the system?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:00):**  How could they be brought in to influence the system?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:02):**  What of the many different ecological functions  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:05):**  they perform could be incorporated to support  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:08):**  and enhance what I'm already working on or designing  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:12):**  to make the system more holistic, more closed loop.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:14):**  You know, fungi are the loop closers  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:16):**  in especially nutrient cycling  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:18):**  and through their decomposition rules  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:20):**  as just powerhouse disassemblers.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:22):**  And I mean, just on that front alone,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:24):**  they could be substantially beneficial  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:27):**  in top soil building and the breakdown of almost any,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:31):**  you know, woody debris or agricultural residue  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:34):**  that isn't really good fodder,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:36):**  maybe isn't even possible to be fed to animals as is,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:39):**  but you can grow decomposing fungi,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:42):**  whether or not they produce mushrooms,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:43):**  of course, edible mushrooms,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:44):**  of course, that's a benefit as well.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:46):**  And then they break down the material  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:47):**  and very likely, or depending on the species of mushroom,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:50):**  the leftover of that fungal fermentation  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:53):**  of that agricultural waste actually has become  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:56):**  a viable fodder for an animal.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:58):**  And it's protein infused with the fungal tissue  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:00):**  and the fungus might've broken down, say tannins,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:03):**  if they were in the material  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:04):**  that the animal couldn't tolerate before that.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:06):**  And that's just one example of how we can,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:09):**  by incorporating the skillset of cultivating fungi  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:12):**  and awareness and appreciation  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:13):**  and bringing that skillset into, again,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:17):**  holistic farm or just nutrient management,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:20):**  resource management strategy,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:22):**  fungi can close a pretty big gap that may be existing.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:25):**  And then of course, it's just gonna depend  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:26):**  on a given situation, a given crop or farmland  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:29):**  or design how fungi may fit in to a significant degree  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:33):**  or to a minor degree.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:35):**  The two sort of broad groups you mentioned,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:37):**  the trichoderma molds have been well-studied for decades  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:39):**  and are quite appreciated overseas,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:41):**  especially say in India,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:43):**  they're much more commonly applied to root systems  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:46):**  to protect against pathogens or to compost piles  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:49):**  to speed up the breakdown.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:51):**  But it just hasn't gotten over here as quick,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:53):**  but we're starting to catch up in the West,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:55):**  generally speaking, Asian cultures  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:58):**  and down in Southeast Asia and things as well,  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:00):**  the appreciation and awareness of mushrooms especially,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:04):**  but other fungi is much more ingrained in the culture  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:07):**  and moldy foods, there are certain moldy foods  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:10):**  that are central to the cuisine of say China and Japan.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:15):**  Miso and soy sauce, these are products of a mold,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:18):**  essentially, the culture relationship is just so different  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:20):**  and let alone the mushroom consumption.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:22):**  In the West, we have an aversion to fungi  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:24):**  that dates back 100, 200 years  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:27):**  and is a bit outdated nowadays,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:30):**  but still looms and has kept us distanced.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:33):**  And as awareness grows, as education spreads  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:35):**  and excitement around all the fungi seem to offer  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:39):**  becomes more available,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:40):**  then we're gonna start to have that critical mass  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:42):**  and that sea change of awareness.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:45):**  And in my hope, really one day,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:47):**  that consideration of fungi first will play into  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:50):**  so much of our ecological and environmental education  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:54):**  and as practitioners are planning.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:57):**  I really do feel as strongly that fungi  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:59):**  are such critical keystone components of any ecosystem  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:03):**  that they need to be much more central to our paradigms.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:07):**  That's not to dismiss the bacterial players  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:09):**  and everything else of course,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:10):**  it's just can't overlook one of the biggest branches  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:13):**  in the tree of life.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:15):**  I asked you why fungi other than mycorrhizae  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:17):**  and Trichoderma are also important and you, my goodness,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:22):**  the key pieces that you mentioned, bioremediation,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:25):**  nutrient transport, immune reactions, drought stress,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:28):**  moisture use efficiency, nutrient transportation,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:30):**  those are, I feel like we could speak about  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:33):**  each one of those topics in and of itself  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:35):**  for quite an extended period.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:38):**  So I know that one of the major interests  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:41):**  that the growers have today we're experiencing,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:45):**  we just have vagaries of the weather,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:46):**  we don't have a climate anymore.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:48):**  A major concern for many growers is developing  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:51):**  more drought resilient crops and being able to  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:55):**  survive drought stress and be more moisture efficient.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:59):**  Could you expand for just a little bit on  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:01):**  how fungi can help do that work better?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:05):**  Well, the easier answers are the more straightforward  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:08):**  and familiar ones is building lots of good topsoil  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:11):**  that can hold more water, good structure,  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:14):**  good humus content and fungi play into that  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:17):**  as I've sort of mentioned.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:19):**  One of the categories of mycorrhizal fungi,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:21):**  there are seven categories we recognize  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:24):**  and one of those categories are the more commonly  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:26):**  appreciated agricultural mycorrhizae  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:28):**  and these are known as arbuscular mycorrhizae  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:31):**  and they produce a protein called glomalin  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:35):**  that takes essentially the micro aggregates  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:38):**  of soil particles that bacteria essentially produce  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:41):**  through their biofilm and they aggregate those smaller bits  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:44):**  into larger aggregates and that's really what makes  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:48):**  the true tilth and the larger structured porosity  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:50):**  of good soil with good drainage but also  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:53):**  good water holding capacity as well.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:56):**  It's actually a significant contributor to calcium sinking  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:00):**  is not only that compound which is very stable  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:02):**  and high in carbon itself but also the fungal tissue  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:05):**  is very high in carbon and is essentially  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:07):**  the primary translator of atmospheric CO2  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:12):**  via the plant but actually sinking it to the soil  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:14):**  is primarily done with fungal mycelium  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:16):**  and the exudates they release.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:18):**  So that's sort of a tangential aspect  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:20):**  maybe of climate variations is the CO2 sinking  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:23):**  but as far as tolerating drought and mitigating those  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:27):**  impacts, helping the plant's root system  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:31):**  be more resilient in various ways  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:33):**  and also just holding more nutrients, more water  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:36):**  through good soil, these mycorrhizae will help  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:38):**  certainly in that capacity and then the decomposers  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:41):**  as I've said will just contribute to your other  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:43):**  composting processes to just speed up soil building.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:47):**  You know shading and all this can't really be done  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:50):**  by fungi so they're just contributing to the growth  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:53):**  of higher canopies to try to mitigate heat and things  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:57):**  but the other aspects of their building soil  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:59):**  is reducing erosion through this stabilizing  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:03):**  they perform not only with the glues  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:05):**  but also the tissue itself, this network of fungal tissue  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:08):**  in the soil will help hold it together and produce,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:11):**  reduce rather the erosion that can lead to desertification  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:14):**  caused by high heat.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:16):**  And so those are sort of the more straightforward approaches  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:19):**  you know ultimately they are the grand solution  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:21):**  for this really major global issue of course  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:24):**  but they can help again alleviate some of the stress  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:27):**  on the plant by supporting essentially the plant's  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:29):**  own immune system.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:31):**  The fungi I mentioned a couple minutes ago  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:32):**  that have been shown to reduce stress and heat  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:35):**  and drought tolerance from inside of the plant.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:38):**  Those have been isolated from plants found in say  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:41):**  thermal pools near volcanically active areas,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:46):**  really hot water that the plant shouldn't be able  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:48):**  to tolerate yet this fungus enables it to tolerate  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:51):**  is one example and they've isolated those fungi  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:54):**  I've identified them from within the plant  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:56):**  and there is some research looking into say applying  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:59):**  those fungi to other plants to try to confer  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:02):**  this drought tolerance and heat tolerance.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:04):**  My concern there always as a word of caution  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:06):**  is just that we don't know the long term effects of that  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:09):**  and that could actually potentially have a negative impact  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:11):**  on the other natural or native internal fungi  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:14):**  in that new host plant and there could be unforeseen  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:18):**  ecological effects and effects on the plant's overall health  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:21):**  by sort of shifting this internal fungal population  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:24):**  to try to bring about drought resistance  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:26):**  if that makes sense.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:27):**  So it's a little bit of you know going beyond  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:30):**  our field of awareness and sort of shooting blindly.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:33):**  So rather than taking that approach which is not something  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:36):**  I advocate, it's more about trying to build  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:39):**  more resilient crops if possible and then just providing  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:42):**  what they need to deal with the heat in general  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:44):**  of shade and water.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:47):**  You've mentioned a couple of pieces which I think  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:49):**  are important to follow up on a bit.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:53):**  One of them being the humification process,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:56):**  carbon sequestration, carbon sinking.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:59):**  There's getting to be a much better understanding  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:01):**  that the really important work of carbon sequestration  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:05):**  happens when you have plants that are photosynthesizing  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:07):**  really well and transmitting an abundant quantity of sugars  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:11):**  out through the root systems as root exudates.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:14):**  And I think from that point once we have root exudates,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:18):**  that's where the conversation starts becoming really muddy  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:21):**  about different roles of fungi versus bacteria, et cetera  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:25):**  and there's a substantial lack of clarity  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:27):**  around the role of fungi in producing stable humic  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:31):**  substances and stable soil aggregates.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:34):**  So what is the value and the importance of fungi in,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:38):**  I know you mentioned this and already described it  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:41):**  to some degree but what is the function of fungi  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:43):**  relative to bacteria and how can we improve the function  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:48):**  of fungal populations in our agricultural soils?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:52):**  Well it's certainly an ecology down there  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:56):**  so everything is sort of working together.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:58):**  One good example of a strong fungal bacteria relationship  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:02):**  plant producers might be interested in is the exchange  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:06):**  between rhizobia, nitrogen fixing bacteria  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:09):**  and the arbuscular mycorrhizae that I was just talking about  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:13):**  so there's actually in natural systems  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:15):**  it's a three-way exchange and we might try to bring in  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:18):**  rhizobia or even inoculate our leguminous plants with them  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:22):**  but we would also benefit to bring in these AM fungi.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:25):**  They work synergistically where the fungi are bringing in  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:29):**  elements that the plant can then use  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:31):**  to then feed the rhizobia so the enzymes that fix nitrogen  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:34):**  are produced and active and then it feeds back to the plant  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:37):**  which then feeds back to the fungus  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:39):**  that's attached to the plant  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:40):**  so the three of them work together.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:42):**  The mycelium travels as a network  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:45):**  and for folks that aren't familiar  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:47):**  these fungi clamp on a plant roots and extend into the soil  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:50):**  essentially increasing the surface area  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:52):**  of the plant's own root system 10 to a thousand fold.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:56):**  The fungal tissue is much thinner in diameter  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:59):**  and can travel faster and can do a lot of chemistry  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:02):**  essentially that the plant never evolved to do.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:04):**  The exudates they release is primarily to attract fungi  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:06):**  and bacteria helpers both for nutrient provision  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:11):**  and also for defense that especially the fungi provide.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:16):**  So the plant is providing these exudates yes  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:18):**  but that goes on to feed the other microbes  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:20):**  that actually do much of the work in the soil  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:23):**  but then also a lot to sink it especially via the fungi  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:26):**  as I mentioned with their tissue and their own exudates.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:28):**  We need all these players together  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:31):**  in a long-term soil succession.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:33):**  Soils of course become more fungal dominant  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:36):**  with a complex of especially ectomycorrhizal mushrooms  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:40):**  that come typically with more tree crops  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:42):**  in an established forest.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:44):**  And in agricultural setting you know  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:45):**  you're not really gonna be able to accomplish that as much.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:48):**  You're more trying to bring in whichever mycorrhizae  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:51):**  are known to associate with whatever plants you work with.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:54):**  And if it's annuals or perennial shrubs or something  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:57):**  it's probably gonna be more the arbusculomycorrhizae.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:00):**  These are non-mushroom forming fungi  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:02):**  as opposed to what I just mentioned.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:03):**  The ectomycorrhizae these are the mushroom formers,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:05):**  mushroom and truffle formers in our forests.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:08):**  Those are much more difficult to establish in an orchard  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:11):**  as probably orchards who've looked into trying to grow  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:13):**  say chanterelles might know.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:15):**  But there are these other fungi we can bring in.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:18):**  And the dynamics between the different communities  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:21):**  you know in my opinion also isn't as well studied  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:24):**  as it could be.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:25):**  Most of the emphasis has gone towards  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:27):**  looking at the bacterial players  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:29):**  noting when certain types of fungi might indicate problems  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:33):**  or just many are lumped together essentially as bad fungi.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:36):**  And you know some writings you'll read.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:38):**  But the honest truth is that our understanding  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:40):**  of soil fungi is very cursory.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:43):**  We've identified certain types of mycorrhizae  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:45):**  that are beneficial.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:47):**  And of the many that are out there  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:48):**  there's about 300 especially these ectomycorrhizae.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:51):**  Only a couple dozen are really appreciated  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:54):**  from a cultivation standpoint  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:55):**  primarily because they establish well  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:57):**  through our human endeavors.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:59):**  Many won't establish, won't regenerate from spore.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:02):**  We don't know why yet.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:03):**  So there's only a handful that we commonly find  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:06):**  in inoculum products  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:07):**  because they're more guaranteed to work.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:10):**  And even among them certain species  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:12):**  have been highlighted more.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:13):**  But that's just a small, small piece  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:14):**  of all the fungi that are out there.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:16):**  There's many types of molds and yeast  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:18):**  and other types of fungi called chytrids  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:21):**  say that are in soils.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:23):**  And though we can name many of them at this point  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:25):**  we know very little about their ecological role  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:28):**  other than saying they're a decomposer,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:30):**  they eat keratin, they eat chitin,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:32):**  they eat certain things, they eat pollen.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:34):**  But how does that really ripple out  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:35):**  and connect to everything?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:36):**  And what's a good design system  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:38):**  that brings all the pieces together thanks to fungi?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:42):**  I mean, we're far from having a clear plan for that.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:45):**  What I gravitate towards more and appreciate more  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:49):**  is the sort of Korean natural farming approach  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:51):**  bringing in, they say indigenous microorganisms  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:53):**  but it's really like indigenous molds  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:55):**  essentially indigenous fungi  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:57):**  where you go to a relatively healthy forest system  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:01):**  bring some rice, some partially cooked rice  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:04):**  let it sit out for several days or weeks  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:06):**  and mold will just naturally grow on it  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:08):**  from the surrounding airflow.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:10):**  And you bring back that moldy rice  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:11):**  and essentially mix it into your soil  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:13):**  through a series of dilutions.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:15):**  And the thought is you're just trying to bring back  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:17):**  fungal diversity.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:18):**  You could, if you were a mycologist, look under scope  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:20):**  and try to figure out which ones you're actually bringing in  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:23):**  but it's a bit more, you know  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:24):**  just letting nature take its course  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:25):**  and just trying to bring back fungal diversity in general.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:29):**  Because through all of our human endeavors  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:31):**  and disturbance of soil on so many fronts,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:33):**  it's very likely, I mean, it's certain  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:36):**  that we've lost innumerable fungi  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:38):**  whether they're now extinct through human activity  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:42):**  in certain parts of the world perhaps  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:44):**  or just their population.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:45):**  And certainly diversity is gonna be significantly repressed.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:49):**  And even some of the best, you know  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:51):**  organic farms or things or even no-till farms  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:53):**  where they try to not disturb the soil microbes  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:56):**  if those fungi are absent  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:58):**  it's gonna take a very long time for them to come back.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:00):**  So you're trying to speed that up  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:01):**  trying to bring back that natural diversity  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:04):**  say through the Korean natural farming method  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:06):**  is one approach with the thought, with the hope  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:08):**  that it will all sort of balance itself out in the long run.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:12):**  You know, some people like that  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:14):**  some people don't, cause it's not as precise  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:15):**  but the reality of where our knowledge is with soil fungi  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:19):**  and the right approaches is sort of there at this moment.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:21):**  Again, as I said earlier, we need more hands on deck  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:24):**  just trying different approaches, especially in this front.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:29):**  To your point that we don't really understand the role  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:32):**  and know a lot about what these different fungal populations  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:35):**  are doing, we had an experience a couple of years ago  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:39):**  working with mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:41):**  where we're working with a spinach crop  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:45):**  with soils that are very saline soils  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:47):**  very high sodium content.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:49):**  And we're adding bicoron inoculants  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:51):**  in an effort to sequester some of the sodium  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:53):**  and take it out of the system, which historically  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:56):**  in other operations has been very successful.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:58):**  And on this farm, we're not getting the results  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:02):**  that we are used to observing.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:04):**  So we added a mycorrhizal fungi inoculant  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:08):**  and voila, we get this tremendous  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:11):**  sodium sequestration response.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:13):**  Even though spinach is supposedly not  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:16):**  a mycorrhizal symbiotic crop,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:18):**  yet we got a very strong soil remediation effect  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:23):**  of the high concentrations of sodium.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:24):**  So I think that's just one little example  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:28):**  of something that we observed and experienced  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:31):**  that was counter to what we think we may know  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:35):**  about these organisms.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, I mean, that's all those types of examples  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:40):**  and taking a chance is really where it's at  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:43):**  with especially applied mycology.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:45):**  It's a bit like the wild west  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:46):**  where there's just a lot of unexplored terrain.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:50):**  And it's one of those things too  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:51):**  where unfortunately maybe some things have been done  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:53):**  say in Japan or in China where much more research  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:56):**  has gone into some of these applications  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:59):**  but perhaps the papers haven't been translated  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:01):**  into English or they're just of course hard to access.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:05):**  There is a lot of good knowledge out there  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:07):**  with mycological fungi related experiments  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:10):**  that have been done in many different capacities  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:13):**  but they're sort of buried if you will in the literature  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:16):**  and again, many are not translated.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:19):**  So in the Western world, in the English speaking world  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:23):**  and also just in a different sort of cultural context  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:26):**  I guess and maybe different approach  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:27):**  than maybe is happening in other parts of the world.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:29):**  Taking what is known and as you say,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:31):**  both trying new things, trying things  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:33):**  that maybe aren't even supposed to work  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:35):**  or even just taking what's supposed to work  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:37):**  and then seeing how it really plays out  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:38):**  in your soil and your climate,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:40):**  building up this local awareness.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:41):**  I mean, just as we have with many different plant crops  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:45):**  and different regional farming associations  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:47):**  where you can get that local knowledge  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:49):**  of how things have played out over the centuries or decades,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:52):**  we don't have that with fungi.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:53):**  I mean, we have to start somewhere.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:56):**  Of course, trying with the best starting point  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:58):**  but also not being afraid to branch out.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:59):**  I mean, I've done many things personally  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:01):**  with mushroom cultivation.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:03):**  So more just a standard indoor approach, I guess,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:05):**  to growing mushrooms.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:06):**  But even in that arena,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:07):**  there's so much room for innovation still  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:10):**  and I've intentionally done many things  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:12):**  that weren't supposed to work and got them to work.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:14):**  And my interest nowadays is more going  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:18):**  into these broader applications,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:20):**  these larger scale ecological approaches  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:23):**  to working with fungi, both for sort of human endeavors,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:27):**  human labors, but also for just general  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:28):**  environmental restoration on many fronts.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:31):**  And there we have very few anecdotes.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:34):**  The field is wide open, which is exciting  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:37):**  but also a bit intimidating depending on how you look at it.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:40):**  But yeah, I mean, that anecdote is something I'll hold on to  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:44):**  for sure and probably share it in the future.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:47):**  There is a growing desire and a growing conversation,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:51):**  particularly in the domain of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:54):**  to develop what are termed disease suppressive soils,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:58):**  soils which actively antagonize the development  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:02):**  of pathogenic communities.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:05):**  There's two questions that are tied to disease suppression.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:08):**  One of them is how can we develop all the communities  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:12):**  that will contribute to disease suppression?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:14):**  And secondly, there seems to be an inverse relationship  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:17):**  between disease suppressive soils  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:20):**  and soils that have had a historical accumulation  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:25):**  of pesticide applications.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:27):**  So there's kind of two parts to that ecosystem.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:30):**  One is we need to bioremediate  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:33):**  some of the toxin applications  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:35):**  and also hopefully help to shift the fungal population  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:39):**  in that soil profile to develop a much more  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:40):**  disease suppressive soil.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:43):**  How can growers manage fungi and use fungi  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:45):**  to achieve some of those benefits?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:47):**  Yeah, it sounds like a one, two fungal punch, if you will,  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:51):**  where the problem perhaps is the severe disturbance  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:56):**  of the soil through tillage,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:59):**  again, the loss of microbial diversity,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:01):**  especially fungal diversity through all that's been done  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:05):**  to stress the soil along with the chemical application.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:09):**  And if that is still suppressing fungi from returning,  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:13):**  they're not able to do essentially  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:15):**  what I see all fungi do, broadly speaking,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:17):**  which is essentially balance the ecosystem  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:19):**  and hear the ecosystem of the soil.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:21):**  You maybe don't have many important players represented.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:24):**  And so what we consider pathogenic organisms predominate,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:29):**  things that are able to tolerate  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:30):**  and they're not being suppressed or sort of checked  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:32):**  and balanced by controlled mechanisms like fungi.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:35):**  So the remediation and the breakdown of chemical pollutants  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:39):**  in soil is one of the applications of fungal remediation  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:43):**  or micoremediation that is a bit more  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:44):**  of a lower hanging fruit than some of the other applications.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:47):**  There's a number of ways fungi can deal with pollutants  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:50):**  in the soil and in water systems,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:52):**  but some are though interesting, quite inaccessible  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:55):**  to even advanced practitioners  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:57):**  without some heavy duty equipment or expensive equipment.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:59):**  But to deal with what you're describing  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:02):**  is actually a bit approachable.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:03):**  In essence, if the chemical contaminant is known,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:07):**  there are a series of steps a cultivator practitioner  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:11):**  can go through to determine which fungus,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:14):**  often it's a mushroom, but it can be a mold  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:18):**  that is tolerant of that compound  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:20):**  and perhaps quite capable of breaking it down  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:23):**  and degrading it essentially as a food source.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:25):**  And there's even more advanced methods  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:27):**  that can be done to what we say train  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:29):**  or acclimate the fungus to eat that  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:31):**  and tolerate that compound.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:33):**  So you can develop an organism that is targeted  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:36):**  to this contaminant of this pollutant in your soil system.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:40):**  Once that's been done, the mycelium can be bulked up  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:43):**  into large, large quantities  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:45):**  and then mass applied into the soil.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:47):**  This might be one of those instances  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:48):**  where the soil needs to be excavated  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:51):**  to really infuse the mycelium throughout it  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:53):**  and also to provide good airflow so it can breathe  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:56):**  while it does its work of growing through that pollution  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:59):**  and breaking it down, hopefully to tolerable levels  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:03):**  or below sort of effective levels.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:06):**  Once that's done, then it gets put back into place.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:08):**  And then now the soil perhaps has been heavily disturbed  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:10):**  through even additional excavation.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:12):**  So the biology needs to be brought up real quick  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:15):**  through these different mycorrhizal and other fungal  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:19):**  inoculums, other microbial inoculums, compost, compost tea.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:23):**  I mean, I'm a fan of all of it using sort of the best  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:25):**  approach that the grower has available to provide.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:30):**  You know, the mediation of chemically polluted soil  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:32):**  is actually an approach that could be done  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:35):**  by a local grower or even a really dedicated farmer  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:39):**  who wants to learn these skills.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:41):**  It does take time, is the drawback.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:43):**  The whole time you're sort of waiting for months,  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:45):**  not sure if it's really gonna work.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:47):**  So there's that sort of anxiety that might come with it.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:50):**  And then there's some suggested costs,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:52):**  additional cost of testing and perhaps doing a number  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:54):**  of tests to ensure that it's really breaking down  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:57):**  before, during and after the experiment runs  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:00):**  and those tests add up.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:01):**  So those are some of the barriers,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:03):**  but if a given farmer or landowner wants to take  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:06):**  that approach to really deal with their acreage  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:08):**  and if it goes well, it might very well be successful  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:11):**  within several months.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:13):**  You know, there's a lot of variables, but it's not impossible  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:15):**  and then the soil is essentially cleaned  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:17):**  of this major prohibitor of beneficial life,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:21):**  really building out the quality of the soil that's desired  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:24):**  and then sort of the more familiar approaches  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:26):**  can be attempted after that.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:28):**  Peter, there is so much that we don't know  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:31):**  about the types of fungi that we might desire.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:35):**  You described the Asian approach of just adapting  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:39):**  to what is present in the local environment.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:42):**  How would implementing this process that you're describing  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:47):**  look like on scale?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:48):**  Is it practical to apply on a larger scale,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:51):**  on a scale of a thousand acres or more?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:53):**  And if so, what would it look like?  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:55):**  Can you kind of walk us through the process a little bit  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:58):**  just on a very high level?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:00):**  It is scalable.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:02):**  You can start with the harder ones  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:03):**  and maybe go to the easier one.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:04):**  So it ends on a good note, if you will.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:07):**  Probably the less accessible approach would be trying  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:09):**  to chemically or remediate chemically polluted soils  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:12):**  that span acres or even hectares.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:15):**  However large, because you're essentially trying  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:19):**  to collect that soil, gather it and inoculate it,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:22):**  roughly 20 to 30% of its entire volume  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:25):**  should be this fungal inoculum.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:27):**  This mushroom usually is what's often used  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:28):**  in these instances.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:30):**  To grow that out, whether onsite or to commission  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:34):**  a local grower or another grower somewhere in the country,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:38):**  to produce that, I mean, it really adds up both  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:41):**  with the volume of that inoculum to bring in,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:44):**  the mixing it in, the weighting,  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:46):**  and then also even providing shade  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:48):**  so that the material doesn't grow out,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:50):**  or at least keeping it moist.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:51):**  The fungus needs to stay moist while it grows.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:54):**  So it is scalable, but it's just quite a large endeavor.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:57):**  It might be more feasible, manageable to do it  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:00):**  one acre at a time, one half acre at a time.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:03):**  But if you have an incredibly large operation  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:05):**  that might not play out with a timeline,  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:07):**  so there's that.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:08):**  Now, so that's the biggest challenge, perhaps,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:12):**  is really cleaning up large contaminated areas.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:15):**  Generally just bringing in fungal inoculum,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:17):**  I mean, that can be done many number of ways,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:20):**  as probably is familiar to a number of the listeners,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:22):**  where a lot of these products that you can either buy  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:25):**  or even create yourself are primarily just fungal spores  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:30):**  of various types or little fragments of their tissue  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:33):**  that are heavily diluted in a carrier,  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:35):**  whether that's, say, clay or any other sort of soil mix.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:40):**  I mean, if you're already, say, top dressing,  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:42):**  or you can mix it into your compost  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:44):**  if you're gonna be laying that in,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:45):**  or top dressing again on top of your crop for the year.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:49):**  If you have a mixer, a large soil mixer  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:52):**  or something like that, or whatever your detractor  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:55):**  or machinery that seeds the field, et cetera,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:59):**  these inoculums can be mixed in and diluted.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:01):**  You only need, in theory, a couple active spores  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:04):**  to really get the job started.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:07):**  So we work in higher numbers to hedge our bets  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:09):**  that by putting out a lot of spores,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:11):**  we'll get something to take.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:12):**  But at the end of the day, one single, say, mushroom,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:17):**  or one grow container of arbusculomycorrhizae  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:20):**  might be producing hundreds or more likely thousands,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:23):**  if not tens of thousands, depending on the grow size  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:27):**  of the spores of these fungi  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:29):**  that you really don't need very many of  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:31):**  to start the establishment of a network  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:33):**  throughout your whole field.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:35):**  So it is doable.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:36):**  Even with the Korean approach that I mentioned,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:38):**  where you're gathering sort of moldy rice,  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:40):**  it does go through a series of dilutions,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:43):**  and the final product is heavily diluted.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:46):**  I don't know the numbers I have taught in my head,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:48):**  but a relatively small amount of the material  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:51):**  can be extensively spread throughout whole orchards.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:55):**  That is commonly done in Asia, and also in, say, Hawaii,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:58):**  where these practices have actually become quite popular.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:01):**  So it's not unfeasible,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:02):**  especially with these microfungi, as we call them,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:04):**  as opposed to the macro fungi, the mushrooms,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:07):**  which can take quite a bit more to really grow en masse.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:12):**  Peter, if a grower were to want to learn more  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:15):**  about how to implement these practices and these ideas,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:20):**  obviously there's your own book, Radical Mycology,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:22):**  and the courses that you're developing,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:23):**  which I would highly recommend.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:25):**  Are there any other resources or any other books  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:27):**  that you would point people to  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:28):**  that they should look to as an additional resource  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:30):**  for more information and to learn how to implement  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:32):**  and apply these practices and ideas?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:33):**  Well, the Korean natural farming approach,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:35):**  perhaps one of the easiest approaches  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:37):**  to doing some of what I've described,  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:39):**  because you're essentially just putting moldy rice  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:41):**  into a nearby woodlot forest and letting it get moldy.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:45):**  The go-to book on that, most people point towards,  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:48):**  is called JADAM, so J-A-D-A-M,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:52):**  Organic Farming by Master Cho.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:55):**  And that goes through many aspects  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:56):**  of Korean natural farming,  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:58):**  but also gets into these approaches.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:00):**  The arbusculomycorrhizae,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:02):**  now you can buy all kinds of products,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:04):**  as I've sort of mentioned, you've mentioned,  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:06):**  but there are techniques to grow onsite and farm scale  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:09):**  amounts of arbusculomycorrhizal inoculum.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:12):**  In short, the methodology was developed  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:14):**  by the Rodale Institute through a seven-year study  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:18):**  and is available online through their website.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:21):**  I synthesize it in my book,  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:22):**  the book, Mycorrhizal Planet by Michael Phillips,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:25):**  also discusses it and sort of synthesizes it,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:29):**  but it all points back to the Rodale Institute  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:31):**  that did the actual work.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:33):**  And in essence, you take mycorrhizal spores,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:35):**  whether from a commercial product  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:36):**  or actually just from the top soil of a nearby forest  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:39):**  that's been left undisturbed for several years.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:41):**  And there should be mycorrhizal spores there,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:43):**  arbusculomycorrhizal spores.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:45):**  You use those to inoculate some grass or allium starts  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:49):**  or seeds rather in a low nutrient medium.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:52):**  The plant grows, the roots are starved,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:55):**  and they will accept the fungus as a partner  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:58):**  to help feed it.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:59):**  And then you grow out the plant continuously  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:01):**  under low nutrient conditions.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:03):**  And over a series of months, once the plant is big enough  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:06):**  and the fungus network is established in the grow medium,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:09):**  the fungus will naturally start to produce spores.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:11):**  And then you can harvest the spores  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:14):**  and even the mycelium from that soil  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:16):**  in the following season, dilute it into your compost  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:19):**  or your top dressing soil or what have you  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:21):**  as a way to inoculate.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:22):**  And this has been designed intentionally by Rodale  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:25):**  for farm scale approach.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:26):**  So that's a great resource, thanks to them  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:29):**  for their years of researching that.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:31):**  The remediation aspect is quite a bit more technical,  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:35):**  quite a few steps as I've noted.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:36):**  And of course the details are even finer  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:38):**  once you get into it.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:39):**  I would say that my book is one that goes  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:42):**  sort of the clearest into detailing those methodologies,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:46):**  really explaining the theory  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:47):**  and the practices and principles.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:49):**  There are quite a number of other  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:51):**  micro remediation focused textbooks  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:53):**  and technical literature that's out there.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:56):**  But it's not very accessible and it's not written  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:58):**  with this agricultural context really in mind.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:01):**  It's more speaking from an objective scientific standpoint,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:04):**  but it will help explain some of the theory,  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:06):**  the actual application and the how to  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:08):**  is detailed in my book in a way that I have yet to see  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:12):**  produced elsewhere.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:13):**  It's again, as a burgeoning field,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:15):**  there really is not a lot of literature,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:17):**  just on mycology in general.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:19):**  Even just good books for the lay person  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:21):**  on any of these aspects, there's very few out there.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:23):**  It's one of the reasons I wrote my book  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:24):**  is to try to synthesize all these great ideas  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:26):**  that are otherwise hard to find.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:28):**  But yeah, those are some resources.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:31):**  Good resources.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:32):**  Thank you, Peter.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:33):**  We've talked about a lot of different topics.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:35):**  We've covered a lot of territory relatively quickly.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:39):**  What is the question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:41):**  What is something that we haven't yet spoken about  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:42):**  that you believe is very important?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:44):**  Um, it's a great question.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:46):**  I mean, the thing that I always think about  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:49):**  and am constantly trying to challenge myself to answer  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:53):**  is how to best spread this knowledge and awareness  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:57):**  around the world as quickly as possible.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:59):**  And that's kind of always been the emphasis of my work.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:01):**  And I'm just constantly trying to evolve that  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:03):**  or elaborate on better and better ways to do that.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:06):**  And in this context, it's hard for me  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:09):**  to know the best approach really,  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:11):**  because people come at their crop production  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:13):**  and their awareness and appreciation of fungi  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:16):**  from so many different angles  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:17):**  to be able to give the right context  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:20):**  can be a bit of a challenge.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:22):**  But at the same time, the ability to just communicate it  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:25):**  for any of the listeners, I guess I'm saying,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:27):**  that have started to get a sense  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:29):**  that there is something to this topic,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:30):**  as I've tried to emphasize.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:32):**  Hopefully they take that deeper into their own knowledge.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:36):**  And as I teach all my students or say to them  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:39):**  or encourage them to consider,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:41):**  is that thereafter they have been essentially knighted  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:44):**  a fungal ambassador.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:46):**  And to whatever capacity makes sense  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:48):**  and to whatever social contexts allow,  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:51):**  to not be afraid to share your newfound interest  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:55):**  and knowledge around this is still relatively inaccessible  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:58):**  or more obscure topic.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:59):**  And there's only so much I, as one person, can do  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:03):**  to spread the word.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:04):**  It's much more powerful when it becomes  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:06):**  sort of a groundswell and essentially a grassroots effort  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:09):**  to bring fungi more to the fore  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:12):**  and to not be afraid to try new things  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:14):**  and all that we've touched on.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:16):**  I think that that's where it's gonna be the best approach.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:20):**  That includes educating children,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:21):**  attempting all kinds of methods  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:22):**  to bring it into educational sectors  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:25):**  at every level of education  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:27):**  and with every approach under the sun,  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:28):**  from theater to standup comedy,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:32):**  to going to your local farmers association  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:35):**  and seeking out grant funding  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:37):**  for experimental approaches on your own farm.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:40):**  All these things in the long run will pool together  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:43):**  in probably ways we can't quite imagine  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:45):**  to create in time a greater appreciation  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:48):**  and literacy around fungi in the West  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:50):**  that we have yet to fully embrace.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:52):**  And that's when things will get interesting.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:54):**  So I just encourage the listener to, again,  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:56):**  not be afraid to dive in,  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:58):**  start looking into any of these topics.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:00):**  And as with many people, perhaps once you start to dive in,  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:03):**  you'll just keep diving deeper and maybe never let it go.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:08):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:09):**  Peter, thank you very much for sharing your thoughts  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:11):**  and your knowledge.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:13):**  We really appreciate the new information  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:17):**  that you've been able to share with our audience.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:19):**  So thank you very much for being here  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:20):**  and we look forward to having more conversations  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:21):**  with you in the future.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:23):**  Yeah, it's been an absolute pleasure.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:25):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:27):**  Hi, this is Robin.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:28):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:31):**  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:35):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:39):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:42):**  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:46):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:49):**  to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:52):**  we must first think differently about agriculture,  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:55):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:59):**  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:02):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:05):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:07):**  and make more money with less risk.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:11):**  Thank you for listening.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:45:11):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:45:41):**  Thank you.

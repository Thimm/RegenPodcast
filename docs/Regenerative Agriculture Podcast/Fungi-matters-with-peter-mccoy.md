### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-29-17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:46):**  to have these regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which  all other growing systems are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:19):**  or email me, john at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.

**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  I'm really excited with the guest we have today,  Peter McCoy, the founder of MycoLogos,  the country's first mycology teaching school  where Peter describes how to grow fungi  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:01:49):**  and how to introduce them into our ecosystems.  Peter is also the author of a really incredible  fungi textbook titled Radical Mycology.  Peter, we're very excited to have you here with us today.  Thank you for joining us.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:03):**  Yeah, absolutely.  Thanks for having me on.  I'm excited to dive into the often overlooked aspects  of fungi in regenerative agriculture.  Peter, you've done some very interesting work  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:15):**  with fungi over the last decade or more.  Can you tell us a little bit about the pathway  and the journey that you've been on?  What has brought you to this point?  And can you describe for us a little bit  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:24):**  about the work that you're doing today?  Sure.  So I picked up an interest in mycology  when I was a teenager, about 15 or so.  And it was among my many other interests,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:37):**  kind of a random hobby and curiosity  that essentially over the years always stayed  high on my list of interests and other things came and went.  But as with many other people,  as you start to learn about this quite interesting science,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:02:51):**  you kind of can't let it go because it's so intriguing,  so fascinating, so unusual, but also very important,  not only in the environment,  fungi are ecologically significant in many aspects,  but also the implications for what applied mycology offers  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:07):**  for humans and human design systems, food systems,  building systems, societal organizational systems.  And all those points of interest really stood out to me  back then and over the years,  what I came to realize was that even though for me,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:22):**  this topic was clearly quite interesting and important,  most of the folks that I would meet and friends and family  didn't know how to relate to the topic.  And essentially I came to realize that that was just because  they hadn't read what I had read.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:34):**  They didn't learn about this in school.  As I came to realize, I had never learned about it in school  and over the years I came to realize that mycology  is incredibly significant,  but most people just don't know about it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:03:45):**  And when I was in my mid early twenties,  I kind of made a conscious choice to essentially start to  advocate for mycology and to help educate other people  to show them what they've been missing out on,  to sort of bring a spotlight onto this overlooked topic that  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:01):**  as one of our youngest natural sciences has just not been  able to get a strong footing and get a good break,  I guess, in the education system.  And it's sort of been overlooked in so many ways.  So, so that started when I was in my early twenties  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:13):**  with a couple of friends kind of started this,  this grassroots group we called radical mycology,  kind of a ragtag approach to saying mushrooms and fungi  are really cool.  And here's all the ways that they are cool to you.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:25):**  And that hooked and sunk into a number of people,  but we, it was sort of a few introductory topics  is where it started.  But as the years progressed and as I learned more  and as I met more people and intentionally brought  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:37):**  my knowledge of fungi to organizations and groups  and demographics that I went into knowing that they probably  knew very little about fungi,  I started to learn how they would adapt this knowledge  and new insights would come to me about,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:04:51):**  as I learned about different aspects of society and culture,  et cetera, that this topic, mycology applies to,  to everything.  And sometimes again, and really profound  and unexplored ways.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:01):**  So it was, it's been sort of an evolving dialogue  that I've tried to contribute to, but also, you know,  learning from over the years and actively trying to evolve  through articulating and broadening horizons  that have essentially been unexplored in human history.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:17):**  So that organization sort of helped get the word out.  I like to think of radical mycology,  which is still quite active as an advocacy organization  and sort of our culture creation around fungi appreciation.  And that was so successful or our work there has been  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:31):**  so effective that several years ago,  I wrote a book by the same name called Radical Mycology  that basically puts all these big ideas on paper  and these skills.  Most of the book is a hands-on and how to reference book.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:43):**  And then that did so well as a book that essentially  I'm working to translate those offerings  into even more in-depth online courses,  really going quite deep into fungal ecology, cultivation,  what's known as micro remediation or applying fungi  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:05:57):**  to mitigate pollution, natural medicine making,  and many other aspects of all that fungi offer,  starting with online courses, as I say,  but then also expanding in-person offerings  in Portland, Oregon, where I'm based  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:10):**  and eventually abroad as well.  So it's essentially the first mycology-focused school  really ever in the world.  There are other online courses you might come across,  short introductions to things, of course,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:21):**  and different universities offer varying degrees  of mycology education, but nothing like this  has ever really existed where it's very in-depth,  really not only teaching what's known,  but courses will be sculpted in a way that will enable  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:34):**  and inspire, hopefully, and empower the students  to actively contribute to the growth of the science.  One of the great things about mycology is that  being so young and with so little known,  there's many, many ways that the average person  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:06:48):**  can actively contribute to its growth  and come up with even simple applications,  again, even in the regenerative agricultural fields,  especially, that have yet to be explored  because we just need more hands on deck  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:02):**  to put all these ideas to practice.  So that's always been my greatest interest  is enabling that growth of the science,  sort of, again, starting with an advocacy  and now just getting personally better at educating  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:14):**  and articulating what can be complex ideas  for the beginner into frameworks and approaches  that are very relatable and contextualized.  I'm very excited that you are starting this school  and I would encourage all of our listeners  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:27):**  to do some more research,  look at the work that Peter is doing,  look at the work that other people have done,  get the book, read the book as we go through  this conversation, I'm sure you're going to discover  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:37):**  some of the reasons why it is so important  for us to understand fungi better.  So, Peter, perhaps to begin,  I'd love to ask you the question,  particularly within the domain of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:07:49):**  and agricultural ecosystems in general,  there is a growing awareness of the value  of some types of symbiotic fungi,  particularly mycorrhizal fungi,  people are gaining an appreciation for trichoderma  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:03):**  and perhaps a few other fungi,  but by and large, there hasn't really been any adoption  or any in-depth understanding of why fungi are important  and how we can manage them.  And so the question that I'd love to begin with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:18):**  is why are fungi important in agricultural ecosystems  other than just mycorrhizal fungi?  Well, when we look at fungi in an ecological context,  they are nature's greatest chemists.  And on the one end, they're the grand disassemblers  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:34):**  and decomposers able to break down wood  and seemingly almost anything humans create as well,  from toxic chemicals to, you know,  for varying degrees even plastics we're now finding.  So they're great at breaking things down.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:45):**  And that of course leads to soil building  and overall soil health.  But then as the mycorrhizae redistribute nutrients as well  as part of their roles as chemists,  and they actually solubilize nutrients out of the soil  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:08:57):**  and feed them to plants and dose them out  in a way that is not as wasteful, of course,  is applying soluble liquid-based fertilizers  as the other approach to feeding plants.  And then even inside of plants, all plants are permeated,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:10):**  we believe, you know, essentially 100% of their tissues  are from roots to leaf tip with internal fungi  that are known as endophytic fungi  and are likely contributing to varying degrees,  big question marks loom here,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:24):**  but I would bet good money that they're influencing  essentially the immune system of the plant,  helping protect against invading fungi,  pathogenic fungi, insect herbivory,  perhaps to some degree sort of stimulating  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:37):**  the immune response in plants  and just enabling to survive droughts  and high temperatures.  And this we do know in some instances to be true,  and also even producing some of the medicinal compounds  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:09:47):**  in plants and the perhaps some of the nutritional profiling  of plants is influenced by the health and chemical  manipulations, if you will,  that these internal fungi are offering.  So they're doing so much to move nutrients in the world.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:01):**  And that's just a quick snapshot of all that they do.  So, you know, so much of regenerative agriculture  or life in general, we're concerned about our NPKs  and all the other minerals and elements of life  and making sure that they're distributed and moving around.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:16):**  In natural systems, fungi are key players in that  on many, many fronts.  And just that awareness I think is often overlooked,  again, primarily just due to a lack of education,  not because people don't care,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:28):**  it's just that we don't get told  or we don't learn early on or don't learn in depth  even if we obtain higher education in environmental studies,  often fungi are just sort of overlooked  or very poorly acknowledged.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:40):**  So with that sort of that blind spot being pointed out,  we can reposition our paradigms a bit  by considering fungi from a new light.  You know, in my mind, which is a bit biased,  I'm always thinking about fungi first  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:10:53):**  in any ecological context  and also in a human designed context, you know,  how do fungi influence the system?  How could they be brought in to influence the system?  What of the many different ecological functions  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:05):**  they perform could be incorporated to support  and enhance what I'm already working on or designing  to make the system more holistic, more closed loop.  You know, fungi are the loop closers  in especially nutrient cycling  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:18):**  and through their decomposition rules  as just powerhouse disassemblers.  And I mean, just on that front alone,  they could be substantially beneficial  in top soil building and the breakdown of almost any,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:31):**  you know, woody debris or agricultural residue  that isn't really good fodder,  maybe isn't even possible to be fed to animals as is,  but you can grow decomposing fungi,  whether or not they produce mushrooms,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:43):**  of course, edible mushrooms,  of course, that's a benefit as well.  And then they break down the material  and very likely, or depending on the species of mushroom,  the leftover of that fungal fermentation  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:11:53):**  of that agricultural waste actually has become  a viable fodder for an animal.  And it's protein infused with the fungal tissue  and the fungus might've broken down, say tannins,  if they were in the material  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:04):**  that the animal couldn't tolerate before that.  And that's just one example of how we can,  by incorporating the skillset of cultivating fungi  and awareness and appreciation  and bringing that skillset into, again,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:17):**  holistic farm or just nutrient management,  resource management strategy,  fungi can close a pretty big gap that may be existing.  And then of course, it's just gonna depend  on a given situation, a given crop or farmland  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:29):**  or design how fungi may fit in to a significant degree  or to a minor degree.  The two sort of broad groups you mentioned,  the trichoderma molds have been well-studied for decades  and are quite appreciated overseas,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:41):**  especially say in India,  they're much more commonly applied to root systems  to protect against pathogens or to compost piles  to speed up the breakdown.  But it just hasn't gotten over here as quick,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:12:53):**  but we're starting to catch up in the West,  generally speaking, Asian cultures  and down in Southeast Asia and things as well,  the appreciation and awareness of mushrooms especially,  but other fungi is much more ingrained in the culture  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:07):**  and moldy foods, there are certain moldy foods  that are central to the cuisine of say China and Japan.  Miso and soy sauce, these are products of a mold,  essentially, the culture relationship is just so different  and let alone the mushroom consumption.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:22):**  In the West, we have an aversion to fungi  that dates back 100, 200 years  and is a bit outdated nowadays,  but still looms and has kept us distanced.  And as awareness grows, as education spreads  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:35):**  and excitement around all the fungi seem to offer  becomes more available,  then we're gonna start to have that critical mass  and that sea change of awareness.  And in my hope, really one day,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:13:47):**  that consideration of fungi first will play into  so much of our ecological and environmental education  and as practitioners are planning.  I really do feel as strongly that fungi  are such critical keystone components of any ecosystem  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:03):**  that they need to be much more central to our paradigms.  That's not to dismiss the bacterial players  and everything else of course,  it's just can't overlook one of the biggest branches  in the tree of life.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:15):**  I asked you why fungi other than mycorrhizae  and Trichoderma are also important and you, my goodness,  the key pieces that you mentioned, bioremediation,  nutrient transport, immune reactions, drought stress,  moisture use efficiency, nutrient transportation,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:30):**  those are, I feel like we could speak about  each one of those topics in and of itself  for quite an extended period.  So I know that one of the major interests  that the growers have today we're experiencing,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:45):**  we just have vagaries of the weather,  we don't have a climate anymore.  A major concern for many growers is developing  more drought resilient crops and being able to  survive drought stress and be more moisture efficient.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:14:59):**  Could you expand for just a little bit on  how fungi can help do that work better?  Well, the easier answers are the more straightforward  and familiar ones is building lots of good topsoil  that can hold more water, good structure,  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:14):**  good humus content and fungi play into that  as I've sort of mentioned.  One of the categories of mycorrhizal fungi,  there are seven categories we recognize  and one of those categories are the more commonly  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:26):**  appreciated agricultural mycorrhizae  and these are known as arbuscular mycorrhizae  and they produce a protein called glomalin  that takes essentially the micro aggregates  of soil particles that bacteria essentially produce  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:41):**  through their biofilm and they aggregate those smaller bits  into larger aggregates and that's really what makes  the true tilth and the larger structured porosity  of good soil with good drainage but also  good water holding capacity as well.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:15:56):**  It's actually a significant contributor to calcium sinking  is not only that compound which is very stable  and high in carbon itself but also the fungal tissue  is very high in carbon and is essentially  the primary translator of atmospheric CO2  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:12):**  via the plant but actually sinking it to the soil  is primarily done with fungal mycelium  and the exudates they release.  So that's sort of a tangential aspect  maybe of climate variations is the CO2 sinking  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:23):**  but as far as tolerating drought and mitigating those  impacts, helping the plant's root system  be more resilient in various ways  and also just holding more nutrients, more water  through good soil, these mycorrhizae will help  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:38):**  certainly in that capacity and then the decomposers  as I've said will just contribute to your other  composting processes to just speed up soil building.  You know shading and all this can't really be done  by fungi so they're just contributing to the growth  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:16:53):**  of higher canopies to try to mitigate heat and things  but the other aspects of their building soil  is reducing erosion through this stabilizing  they perform not only with the glues  but also the tissue itself, this network of fungal tissue  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:08):**  in the soil will help hold it together and produce,  reduce rather the erosion that can lead to desertification  caused by high heat.  And so those are sort of the more straightforward approaches  you know ultimately they are the grand solution  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:21):**  for this really major global issue of course  but they can help again alleviate some of the stress  on the plant by supporting essentially the plant's  own immune system.  The fungi I mentioned a couple minutes ago  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:32):**  that have been shown to reduce stress and heat  and drought tolerance from inside of the plant.  Those have been isolated from plants found in say  thermal pools near volcanically active areas,  really hot water that the plant shouldn't be able  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:17:48):**  to tolerate yet this fungus enables it to tolerate  is one example and they've isolated those fungi  I've identified them from within the plant  and there is some research looking into say applying  those fungi to other plants to try to confer  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:02):**  this drought tolerance and heat tolerance.  My concern there always as a word of caution  is just that we don't know the long term effects of that  and that could actually potentially have a negative impact  on the other natural or native internal fungi  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:14):**  in that new host plant and there could be unforeseen  ecological effects and effects on the plant's overall health  by sort of shifting this internal fungal population  to try to bring about drought resistance  if that makes sense.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:27):**  So it's a little bit of you know going beyond  our field of awareness and sort of shooting blindly.  So rather than taking that approach which is not something  I advocate, it's more about trying to build  more resilient crops if possible and then just providing  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:42):**  what they need to deal with the heat in general  of shade and water.  You've mentioned a couple of pieces which I think  are important to follow up on a bit.  One of them being the humification process,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:18:56):**  carbon sequestration, carbon sinking.  There's getting to be a much better understanding  that the really important work of carbon sequestration  happens when you have plants that are photosynthesizing  really well and transmitting an abundant quantity of sugars  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:11):**  out through the root systems as root exudates.  And I think from that point once we have root exudates,  that's where the conversation starts becoming really muddy  about different roles of fungi versus bacteria, et cetera  and there's a substantial lack of clarity  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:27):**  around the role of fungi in producing stable humic  substances and stable soil aggregates.  So what is the value and the importance of fungi in,  I know you mentioned this and already described it  to some degree but what is the function of fungi  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:19:43):**  relative to bacteria and how can we improve the function  of fungal populations in our agricultural soils?  Well it's certainly an ecology down there  so everything is sort of working together.  One good example of a strong fungal bacteria relationship  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:02):**  plant producers might be interested in is the exchange  between rhizobia, nitrogen fixing bacteria  and the arbuscular mycorrhizae that I was just talking about  so there's actually in natural systems  it's a three-way exchange and we might try to bring in  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:18):**  rhizobia or even inoculate our leguminous plants with them  but we would also benefit to bring in these AM fungi.  They work synergistically where the fungi are bringing in  elements that the plant can then use  to then feed the rhizobia so the enzymes that fix nitrogen  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:34):**  are produced and active and then it feeds back to the plant  which then feeds back to the fungus  that's attached to the plant  so the three of them work together.  The mycelium travels as a network  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:45):**  and for folks that aren't familiar  these fungi clamp on a plant roots and extend into the soil  essentially increasing the surface area  of the plant's own root system 10 to a thousand fold.  The fungal tissue is much thinner in diameter  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:20:59):**  and can travel faster and can do a lot of chemistry  essentially that the plant never evolved to do.  The exudates they release is primarily to attract fungi  and bacteria helpers both for nutrient provision  and also for defense that especially the fungi provide.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:16):**  So the plant is providing these exudates yes  but that goes on to feed the other microbes  that actually do much of the work in the soil  but then also a lot to sink it especially via the fungi  as I mentioned with their tissue and their own exudates.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:28):**  We need all these players together  in a long-term soil succession.  Soils of course become more fungal dominant  with a complex of especially ectomycorrhizal mushrooms  that come typically with more tree crops  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:42):**  in an established forest.  And in agricultural setting you know  you're not really gonna be able to accomplish that as much.  You're more trying to bring in whichever mycorrhizae  are known to associate with whatever plants you work with.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:21:54):**  And if it's annuals or perennial shrubs or something  it's probably gonna be more the arbusculomycorrhizae.  These are non-mushroom forming fungi  as opposed to what I just mentioned.  The ectomycorrhizae these are the mushroom formers,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:05):**  mushroom and truffle formers in our forests.  Those are much more difficult to establish in an orchard  as probably orchards who've looked into trying to grow  say chanterelles might know.  But there are these other fungi we can bring in.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:18):**  And the dynamics between the different communities  you know in my opinion also isn't as well studied  as it could be.  Most of the emphasis has gone towards  looking at the bacterial players  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:29):**  noting when certain types of fungi might indicate problems  or just many are lumped together essentially as bad fungi.  And you know some writings you'll read.  But the honest truth is that our understanding  of soil fungi is very cursory.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:43):**  We've identified certain types of mycorrhizae  that are beneficial.  And of the many that are out there  there's about 300 especially these ectomycorrhizae.  Only a couple dozen are really appreciated  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:22:54):**  from a cultivation standpoint  primarily because they establish well  through our human endeavors.  Many won't establish, won't regenerate from spore.  We don't know why yet.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:03):**  So there's only a handful that we commonly find  in inoculum products  because they're more guaranteed to work.  And even among them certain species  have been highlighted more.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:13):**  But that's just a small, small piece  of all the fungi that are out there.  There's many types of molds and yeast  and other types of fungi called chytrids  say that are in soils.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:23):**  And though we can name many of them at this point  we know very little about their ecological role  other than saying they're a decomposer,  they eat keratin, they eat chitin,  they eat certain things, they eat pollen.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:34):**  But how does that really ripple out  and connect to everything?  And what's a good design system  that brings all the pieces together thanks to fungi?  I mean, we're far from having a clear plan for that.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:45):**  What I gravitate towards more and appreciate more  is the sort of Korean natural farming approach  bringing in, they say indigenous microorganisms  but it's really like indigenous molds  essentially indigenous fungi  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:23:57):**  where you go to a relatively healthy forest system  bring some rice, some partially cooked rice  let it sit out for several days or weeks  and mold will just naturally grow on it  from the surrounding airflow.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:10):**  And you bring back that moldy rice  and essentially mix it into your soil  through a series of dilutions.  And the thought is you're just trying to bring back  fungal diversity.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:18):**  You could, if you were a mycologist, look under scope  and try to figure out which ones you're actually bringing in  but it's a bit more, you know  just letting nature take its course  and just trying to bring back fungal diversity in general.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:29):**  Because through all of our human endeavors  and disturbance of soil on so many fronts,  it's very likely, I mean, it's certain  that we've lost innumerable fungi  whether they're now extinct through human activity  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:42):**  in certain parts of the world perhaps  or just their population.  And certainly diversity is gonna be significantly repressed.  And even some of the best, you know  organic farms or things or even no-till farms  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:24:53):**  where they try to not disturb the soil microbes  if those fungi are absent  it's gonna take a very long time for them to come back.  So you're trying to speed that up  trying to bring back that natural diversity  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:04):**  say through the Korean natural farming method  is one approach with the thought, with the hope  that it will all sort of balance itself out in the long run.  You know, some people like that  some people don't, cause it's not as precise  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:15):**  but the reality of where our knowledge is with soil fungi  and the right approaches is sort of there at this moment.  Again, as I said earlier, we need more hands on deck  just trying different approaches, especially in this front.  To your point that we don't really understand the role  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:32):**  and know a lot about what these different fungal populations  are doing, we had an experience a couple of years ago  working with mycorrhizal fungi  where we're working with a spinach crop  with soils that are very saline soils  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:47):**  very high sodium content.  And we're adding bicoron inoculants  in an effort to sequester some of the sodium  and take it out of the system, which historically  in other operations has been very successful.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:25:58):**  And on this farm, we're not getting the results  that we are used to observing.  So we added a mycorrhizal fungi inoculant  and voila, we get this tremendous  sodium sequestration response.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:13):**  Even though spinach is supposedly not  a mycorrhizal symbiotic crop,  yet we got a very strong soil remediation effect  of the high concentrations of sodium.  So I think that's just one little example  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:28):**  of something that we observed and experienced  that was counter to what we think we may know  about these organisms.  Yeah, I mean, that's all those types of examples  and taking a chance is really where it's at  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:43):**  with especially applied mycology.  It's a bit like the wild west  where there's just a lot of unexplored terrain.  And it's one of those things too  where unfortunately maybe some things have been done  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:26:53):**  say in Japan or in China where much more research  has gone into some of these applications  but perhaps the papers haven't been translated  into English or they're just of course hard to access.  There is a lot of good knowledge out there  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:07):**  with mycological fungi related experiments  that have been done in many different capacities  but they're sort of buried if you will in the literature  and again, many are not translated.  So in the Western world, in the English speaking world  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:23):**  and also just in a different sort of cultural context  I guess and maybe different approach  than maybe is happening in other parts of the world.  Taking what is known and as you say,  both trying new things, trying things  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:33):**  that maybe aren't even supposed to work  or even just taking what's supposed to work  and then seeing how it really plays out  in your soil and your climate,  building up this local awareness.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:41):**  I mean, just as we have with many different plant crops  and different regional farming associations  where you can get that local knowledge  of how things have played out over the centuries or decades,  we don't have that with fungi.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:27:53):**  I mean, we have to start somewhere.  Of course, trying with the best starting point  but also not being afraid to branch out.  I mean, I've done many things personally  with mushroom cultivation.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:03):**  So more just a standard indoor approach, I guess,  to growing mushrooms.  But even in that arena,  there's so much room for innovation still  and I've intentionally done many things  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:12):**  that weren't supposed to work and got them to work.  And my interest nowadays is more going  into these broader applications,  these larger scale ecological approaches  to working with fungi, both for sort of human endeavors,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:27):**  human labors, but also for just general  environmental restoration on many fronts.  And there we have very few anecdotes.  The field is wide open, which is exciting  but also a bit intimidating depending on how you look at it.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:40):**  But yeah, I mean, that anecdote is something I'll hold on to  for sure and probably share it in the future.  There is a growing desire and a growing conversation,  particularly in the domain of regenerative agriculture  to develop what are termed disease suppressive soils,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:28:58):**  soils which actively antagonize the development  of pathogenic communities.  There's two questions that are tied to disease suppression.  One of them is how can we develop all the communities  that will contribute to disease suppression?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:14):**  And secondly, there seems to be an inverse relationship  between disease suppressive soils  and soils that have had a historical accumulation  of pesticide applications.  So there's kind of two parts to that ecosystem.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:30):**  One is we need to bioremediate  some of the toxin applications  and also hopefully help to shift the fungal population  in that soil profile to develop a much more  disease suppressive soil.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:43):**  How can growers manage fungi and use fungi  to achieve some of those benefits?  Yeah, it sounds like a one, two fungal punch, if you will,  where the problem perhaps is the severe disturbance  of the soil through tillage,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:29:59):**  again, the loss of microbial diversity,  especially fungal diversity through all that's been done  to stress the soil along with the chemical application.  And if that is still suppressing fungi from returning,  they're not able to do essentially  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:15):**  what I see all fungi do, broadly speaking,  which is essentially balance the ecosystem  and hear the ecosystem of the soil.  You maybe don't have many important players represented.  And so what we consider pathogenic organisms predominate,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:29):**  things that are able to tolerate  and they're not being suppressed or sort of checked  and balanced by controlled mechanisms like fungi.  So the remediation and the breakdown of chemical pollutants  in soil is one of the applications of fungal remediation  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:43):**  or micoremediation that is a bit more  of a lower hanging fruit than some of the other applications.  There's a number of ways fungi can deal with pollutants  in the soil and in water systems,  but some are though interesting, quite inaccessible  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:30:55):**  to even advanced practitioners  without some heavy duty equipment or expensive equipment.  But to deal with what you're describing  is actually a bit approachable.  In essence, if the chemical contaminant is known,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:07):**  there are a series of steps a cultivator practitioner  can go through to determine which fungus,  often it's a mushroom, but it can be a mold  that is tolerant of that compound  and perhaps quite capable of breaking it down  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:23):**  and degrading it essentially as a food source.  And there's even more advanced methods  that can be done to what we say train  or acclimate the fungus to eat that  and tolerate that compound.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:33):**  So you can develop an organism that is targeted  to this contaminant of this pollutant in your soil system.  Once that's been done, the mycelium can be bulked up  into large, large quantities  and then mass applied into the soil.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:47):**  This might be one of those instances  where the soil needs to be excavated  to really infuse the mycelium throughout it  and also to provide good airflow so it can breathe  while it does its work of growing through that pollution  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:31:59):**  and breaking it down, hopefully to tolerable levels  or below sort of effective levels.  Once that's done, then it gets put back into place.  And then now the soil perhaps has been heavily disturbed  through even additional excavation.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:12):**  So the biology needs to be brought up real quick  through these different mycorrhizal and other fungal  inoculums, other microbial inoculums, compost, compost tea.  I mean, I'm a fan of all of it using sort of the best  approach that the grower has available to provide.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:30):**  You know, the mediation of chemically polluted soil  is actually an approach that could be done  by a local grower or even a really dedicated farmer  who wants to learn these skills.  It does take time, is the drawback.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:43):**  The whole time you're sort of waiting for months,  not sure if it's really gonna work.  So there's that sort of anxiety that might come with it.  And then there's some suggested costs,  additional cost of testing and perhaps doing a number  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:32:54):**  of tests to ensure that it's really breaking down  before, during and after the experiment runs  and those tests add up.  So those are some of the barriers,  but if a given farmer or landowner wants to take  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:06):**  that approach to really deal with their acreage  and if it goes well, it might very well be successful  within several months.  You know, there's a lot of variables, but it's not impossible  and then the soil is essentially cleaned  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:17):**  of this major prohibitor of beneficial life,  really building out the quality of the soil that's desired  and then sort of the more familiar approaches  can be attempted after that.  Peter, there is so much that we don't know  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:31):**  about the types of fungi that we might desire.  You described the Asian approach of just adapting  to what is present in the local environment.  How would implementing this process that you're describing  look like on scale?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:33:48):**  Is it practical to apply on a larger scale,  on a scale of a thousand acres or more?  And if so, what would it look like?  Can you kind of walk us through the process a little bit  just on a very high level?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:00):**  It is scalable.  You can start with the harder ones  and maybe go to the easier one.  So it ends on a good note, if you will.  Probably the less accessible approach would be trying  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:09):**  to chemically or remediate chemically polluted soils  that span acres or even hectares.  However large, because you're essentially trying  to collect that soil, gather it and inoculate it,  roughly 20 to 30% of its entire volume  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:25):**  should be this fungal inoculum.  This mushroom usually is what's often used  in these instances.  To grow that out, whether onsite or to commission  a local grower or another grower somewhere in the country,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:38):**  to produce that, I mean, it really adds up both  with the volume of that inoculum to bring in,  the mixing it in, the weighting,  and then also even providing shade  so that the material doesn't grow out,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:34:50):**  or at least keeping it moist.  The fungus needs to stay moist while it grows.  So it is scalable, but it's just quite a large endeavor.  It might be more feasible, manageable to do it  one acre at a time, one half acre at a time.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:03):**  But if you have an incredibly large operation  that might not play out with a timeline,  so there's that.  Now, so that's the biggest challenge, perhaps,  is really cleaning up large contaminated areas.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:15):**  Generally just bringing in fungal inoculum,  I mean, that can be done many number of ways,  as probably is familiar to a number of the listeners,  where a lot of these products that you can either buy  or even create yourself are primarily just fungal spores  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:30):**  of various types or little fragments of their tissue  that are heavily diluted in a carrier,  whether that's, say, clay or any other sort of soil mix.  I mean, if you're already, say, top dressing,  or you can mix it into your compost  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:44):**  if you're gonna be laying that in,  or top dressing again on top of your crop for the year.  If you have a mixer, a large soil mixer  or something like that, or whatever your detractor  or machinery that seeds the field, et cetera,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:35:59):**  these inoculums can be mixed in and diluted.  You only need, in theory, a couple active spores  to really get the job started.  So we work in higher numbers to hedge our bets  that by putting out a lot of spores,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:11):**  we'll get something to take.  But at the end of the day, one single, say, mushroom,  or one grow container of arbusculomycorrhizae  might be producing hundreds or more likely thousands,  if not tens of thousands, depending on the grow size  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:27):**  of the spores of these fungi  that you really don't need very many of  to start the establishment of a network  throughout your whole field.  So it is doable.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:36):**  Even with the Korean approach that I mentioned,  where you're gathering sort of moldy rice,  it does go through a series of dilutions,  and the final product is heavily diluted.  I don't know the numbers I have taught in my head,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:36:48):**  but a relatively small amount of the material  can be extensively spread throughout whole orchards.  That is commonly done in Asia, and also in, say, Hawaii,  where these practices have actually become quite popular.  So it's not unfeasible,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:02):**  especially with these microfungi, as we call them,  as opposed to the macro fungi, the mushrooms,  which can take quite a bit more to really grow en masse.  Peter, if a grower were to want to learn more  about how to implement these practices and these ideas,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:20):**  obviously there's your own book, Radical Mycology,  and the courses that you're developing,  which I would highly recommend.  Are there any other resources or any other books  that you would point people to  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:28):**  that they should look to as an additional resource  for more information and to learn how to implement  and apply these practices and ideas?  Well, the Korean natural farming approach,  perhaps one of the easiest approaches  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:37):**  to doing some of what I've described,  because you're essentially just putting moldy rice  into a nearby woodlot forest and letting it get moldy.  The go-to book on that, most people point towards,  is called JADAM, so J-A-D-A-M,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:37:52):**  Organic Farming by Master Cho.  And that goes through many aspects  of Korean natural farming,  but also gets into these approaches.  The arbusculomycorrhizae,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:02):**  now you can buy all kinds of products,  as I've sort of mentioned, you've mentioned,  but there are techniques to grow onsite and farm scale  amounts of arbusculomycorrhizal inoculum.  In short, the methodology was developed  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:14):**  by the Rodale Institute through a seven-year study  and is available online through their website.  I synthesize it in my book,  the book, Mycorrhizal Planet by Michael Phillips,  also discusses it and sort of synthesizes it,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:29):**  but it all points back to the Rodale Institute  that did the actual work.  And in essence, you take mycorrhizal spores,  whether from a commercial product  or actually just from the top soil of a nearby forest  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:39):**  that's been left undisturbed for several years.  And there should be mycorrhizal spores there,  arbusculomycorrhizal spores.  You use those to inoculate some grass or allium starts  or seeds rather in a low nutrient medium.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:38:52):**  The plant grows, the roots are starved,  and they will accept the fungus as a partner  to help feed it.  And then you grow out the plant continuously  under low nutrient conditions.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:03):**  And over a series of months, once the plant is big enough  and the fungus network is established in the grow medium,  the fungus will naturally start to produce spores.  And then you can harvest the spores  and even the mycelium from that soil  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:16):**  in the following season, dilute it into your compost  or your top dressing soil or what have you  as a way to inoculate.  And this has been designed intentionally by Rodale  for farm scale approach.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:26):**  So that's a great resource, thanks to them  for their years of researching that.  The remediation aspect is quite a bit more technical,  quite a few steps as I've noted.  And of course the details are even finer  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:38):**  once you get into it.  I would say that my book is one that goes  sort of the clearest into detailing those methodologies,  really explaining the theory  and the practices and principles.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:39:49):**  There are quite a number of other  micro remediation focused textbooks  and technical literature that's out there.  But it's not very accessible and it's not written  with this agricultural context really in mind.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:01):**  It's more speaking from an objective scientific standpoint,  but it will help explain some of the theory,  the actual application and the how to  is detailed in my book in a way that I have yet to see  produced elsewhere.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:13):**  It's again, as a burgeoning field,  there really is not a lot of literature,  just on mycology in general.  Even just good books for the lay person  on any of these aspects, there's very few out there.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:23):**  It's one of the reasons I wrote my book  is to try to synthesize all these great ideas  that are otherwise hard to find.  But yeah, those are some resources.  Good resources.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:32):**  Thank you, Peter.  We've talked about a lot of different topics.  We've covered a lot of territory relatively quickly.  What is the question that you wish I would have asked?  What is something that we haven't yet spoken about  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:42):**  that you believe is very important?  Um, it's a great question.  I mean, the thing that I always think about  and am constantly trying to challenge myself to answer  is how to best spread this knowledge and awareness  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:40:57):**  around the world as quickly as possible.  And that's kind of always been the emphasis of my work.  And I'm just constantly trying to evolve that  or elaborate on better and better ways to do that.  And in this context, it's hard for me  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:09):**  to know the best approach really,  because people come at their crop production  and their awareness and appreciation of fungi  from so many different angles  to be able to give the right context  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:20):**  can be a bit of a challenge.  But at the same time, the ability to just communicate it  for any of the listeners, I guess I'm saying,  that have started to get a sense  that there is something to this topic,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:30):**  as I've tried to emphasize.  Hopefully they take that deeper into their own knowledge.  And as I teach all my students or say to them  or encourage them to consider,  is that thereafter they have been essentially knighted  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:44):**  a fungal ambassador.  And to whatever capacity makes sense  and to whatever social contexts allow,  to not be afraid to share your newfound interest  and knowledge around this is still relatively inaccessible  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:41:58):**  or more obscure topic.  And there's only so much I, as one person, can do  to spread the word.  It's much more powerful when it becomes  sort of a groundswell and essentially a grassroots effort  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:09):**  to bring fungi more to the fore  and to not be afraid to try new things  and all that we've touched on.  I think that that's where it's gonna be the best approach.  That includes educating children,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:21):**  attempting all kinds of methods  to bring it into educational sectors  at every level of education  and with every approach under the sun,  from theater to standup comedy,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:32):**  to going to your local farmers association  and seeking out grant funding  for experimental approaches on your own farm.  All these things in the long run will pool together  in probably ways we can't quite imagine  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:45):**  to create in time a greater appreciation  and literacy around fungi in the West  that we have yet to fully embrace.  And that's when things will get interesting.  So I just encourage the listener to, again,  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:42:56):**  not be afraid to dive in,  start looking into any of these topics.  And as with many people, perhaps once you start to dive in,  you'll just keep diving deeper and maybe never let it go.  Wonderful.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:09):**  Peter, thank you very much for sharing your thoughts  and your knowledge.  We really appreciate the new information  that you've been able to share with our audience.  So thank you very much for being here  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:20):**  and we look forward to having more conversations  with you in the future.  Yeah, it's been an absolute pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  Hi, this is Robin.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:28):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:43:46):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant  to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  we must first think differently about agriculture,  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:44:02):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  that help growers produce higher quality yield  and make more money with less risk.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:45:11):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:47:41):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/fungi-matters-with-peter-mccoy/#t=0:50:11):**  Thank you.

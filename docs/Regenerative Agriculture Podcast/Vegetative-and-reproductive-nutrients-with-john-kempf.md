**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere and when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:33):**  resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:03):**  regenerative agriculture podcast. I've been asked a lot recently about how to use nutrients to manage  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:10):**  vegetative growth versus reproductive growth and how we can produce high quality fruit wood  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:16):**  on trees while still getting strong vegetative growth at the same time. This is a very important  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:21):**  topic. I've been asked a lot about it recently and so I wanted to share with some thoughts with you  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:26):**  about some of the things that we've observed and that we have learned over the years. There are  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:29):**  some nutrients which drive strong vegetative growth and there are some nutrients which drive  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:35):**  strong reproductive growth and reproductive development. Then for some of these nutrients  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:41):**  in both categories, they interact with and synergize with different groups of plant hormones.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:49):**  You can have this synergistic effect where you have certain nutrients synergizing with certain  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:54):**  hormones and then others antagonizing other hormones. You have this kind of two-tier effect  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:58):**  where you can really shape how plants trigger reproductive buds, reproductive bud development,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:04):**  and fruit wood development. I wanted to talk about some of those pieces. Perhaps to begin from  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:10):**  a nutrient management perspective, there are four nutrients which drive strong vegetative growth.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:18):**  A different terminology, a different way of thinking about it might be to say that they have  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:22):**  a strong male energy and male energy development. That is strong vegetative growth. Those four  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:27):**  nutrients which drive vegetative growth are nitrate nitrogen, specifically nitrate, not  
**[0:03:34-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:34):**  ammonium or urea or other forms, and potassium and chloride and calcium. Those four, nitrate,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:44):**  potassium, chloride, calcium, will drive very strong vegetative growth. We can see this being  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:50):**  expressed in how we manage agronomy and plant nutrition on a number of different crops for  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:56):**  many grassy plants such as corn and sorghum, et cetera. We use nitrate to get our strong  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:03):**  vegetative growth shot with very strong nitrogen applications. This is true of many tree fruit  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:09):**  production as well, almonds, et cetera. Then there are other crops where we use  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:14):**  potassium to get a very strong vegetative growth response such as alfalfa. Chloride also contributes  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:20):**  a very strong growth response because of the energy similarities that it carries to potassium  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:25):**  and some of the ways that it functions in cells and in cell membranes. You have these four  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:29):**  nutrients giving us strong vegetative growth. On the reproductive side, essentially everything  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:35):**  else, all the other nutrients excluding these four, will trigger a slight reproductive response  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:41):**  in plants. There are three in particular which are the heavyweights of the reproductive category.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:48):**  The three nutrients which drive strong reproductive development or bud initiation would be manganese,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:56):**  phosphorus, and ammonium in that sequence, in that order of priority. Manganese tends to have a very  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:03):**  strong reproductive crop response followed by phosphorus and then lastly followed by ammonium  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:08):**  which is then followed by the long tail of everything else. The way to think about this  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:13):**  as this relates to plant management and crop management is that there is both vegetative  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:18):**  growth and reproductive growth happening all the time in every single organelle and every cell  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:25):**  within the plant. There is never a complete dominance where you have 100-0 or even 90-10  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:32):**  ratio between these two. Instead, this is a relatively sensitive fulcrum, a balance beam  
**[0:05:39-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:39):**  where the ratio might be 55-45 where you have 55% vegetative energy, 45% reproductive energy,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:48):**  or vice versa. What this means because there is both vegetative and reproductive growth happening  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:54):**  all the time, it means that very small amount of nutrient applications can actually trigger  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:59):**  and switch from one side to the other. For example, one of the common challenges that we see  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:05):**  sometimes with tomato production, some varieties of tomatoes under some management systems,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:10):**  when we have an over application of nitrogen which converts in the soil to the nitrate form,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:16):**  we end up with a tomato plant that is lush and green, has a lot of vegetative energy,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:20):**  but has no fruit. You have this beautiful green plant but it doesn't have a single blossom on it,  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:25):**  doesn't have a single bud. That's a plant that is completely vegetatively dominant. You can switch  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:32):**  a plant like that from being vegetative dominant to reproductive dominant with a single foliar  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:38):**  application of manganese and phosphorus, for example. The nutrients which have a very strong  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:45):**  reproductive trigger, you can literally paint a tomato field from green to yellow in a matter  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:54):**  of about 7-10 days with the right foliar application. It's possible by managing nutrients  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:01):**  to produce a very rapid switch from vegetative growth to reproductive growth or vice versa.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:07):**  But there's another layer here which is where it starts getting to be really fascinating.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:13):**  When we understand how these two layers interact, we can begin producing very reproductive dominant  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:20):**  plants that also have very strong vegetative growth but it's very high quality vegetative  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:26):**  growth. I want to describe this because it's very important. The second layer is understanding how  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:33):**  plant hormones interact with these base nutrients. There are five major groups of plant hormones. You  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:40):**  have auxins, your cytokines, your gibberellins, ethylene, cystic acid, etc., acetic acid. But the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:46):**  two that I want to focus on are the two foundational groups for plant development, which would be  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:52):**  auxins and cytokines. For those of you not familiar with this terminology, auxins is spelled  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:00):**  A-U-X-I-N-S. You can do more research looking at some of these various plant hormones. But the  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:07):**  very simplistic explanation is that auxins are produced in two parts or two locations inside the  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:14):**  plant. One is they're produced in growing shoot tips. The shoot tip at the top of the plant, the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:21):**  apical meristem, has to be growing every day, every 24 hours. As that growing shoot tip is growing,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:29):**  it is producing auxin. The second place that auxin is being produced is in the developing seed.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:36):**  Once you have blossoming and pollination and the seed begins forming, the seed begins developing,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:41):**  now you have auxin production in the seed. The interesting part about auxin is that you can  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:47):**  you can think of auxin to some degree as being the sugar magnet. Wherever auxin is in the highest  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:56):**  concentrations, that is where the sugar goes from the photosynthesis factory called the leaves.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:02):**  Every 24-hour photo period, as we have photosynthesis and sugar production in the leaves,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:07):**  that sugar moves out of the leaves in the afternoon and evening, moving to the sugar sinks.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:12):**  Those sugar sinks are determined by the auxin concentrations. When we have high

**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:23):**  is going to go. Now the interesting part is that auxin, when it's produced in the shoots  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:29):**  or in the seeds, but particularly shoots, it will move out of the shoot, move down through  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:34):**  the plant, out through the root system to the growing root tips. When it gets to the growing  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:40):**  root tips, it shuts down cytokine production. Let's switch gears from auxin to cytokine  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:47):**  for just a moment. Cytokinins, unlike auxins, are produced in growing shoot tips and seeds.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:09:54):**  Cytokinins are produced in growing root tips. Again, this means that we need to have  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:01):**  the root tips growing every single day for new cytokine production if we want to maintain a  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:07):**  balance between cytokines and auxins. When cytokines are produced in growing root tips,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:14):**  they now move up to the upper part of the plant and they slow down shoot growth. They slow down  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:21):**  vegetative shoot growth and they trigger reproduction. You can think of these two  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:27):**  hormones, cytokines and auxins, to some degree as having an antagonistic relationship. They're  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:32):**  constantly competing with each other. Each is trying to be dominant inside the plant.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:36):**  The plant structure. Auxins are trying to be dominant and suppress cytokine formation.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:42):**  Cytokinins are trying to be dominant and slow down shoot growth and auxin formation. These two

**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:10:54):**  growth, vegetative growth is not all equal. We know that we can have vegetative new shoot growth  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:01):**  on let's say a cherry or apple tree or any tree fruit or berry plant or any annual vegetable crop.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:07):**  We can have poor quality shoot growth and high quality shoot growth. The way that that's commonly  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:12):**  defined and looked at is on annual crops and also to some degree on perennial crops,  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:18):**  we look at internode spacing. We want to have internodes spaced as tightly together as possible.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:24):**  If we have internodes that are two inches apart instead of being six inches apart, we know that  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:30):**  we have that much more opportunity for reproductive buds in the future and that is much higher quality  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:37):**  fruitwood. At the same time, wood that has more closely spaced internodes also is going to have  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:43):**  a higher carbon content and higher carbohydrate concentrations. Again, you have the potential to  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:48):**  have much more reproductive fruitwood. When we look at quality of shoot growth, we're looking at  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:11:53):**  internode spacing for all crops and on tree fruit, we're also looking at carbon content and what  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:00):**  really defines high quality shoot growth. The interesting part is that you can have equally  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:06):**  rapid growth. You can have a shoot that extends 18 inches in three weeks. I'm just making up a  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:12):**  hypothetical example. A shoot that extends 18 inches in three weeks with internodes that are  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:17):**  spaced at two inches or internodes that are spaced at six inches. The same amount of lateral  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:23):**  growth can happen in the same amount of time, but the number of internodes that are spaced  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:28):**  along that shoot are determined by the nutrient ratios and by the hormone ratios that are present  
**[0:12:34-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:34):**  inside the plant. This brings us back to our discussion of these four nutrients which drive  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:43):**  vegetative growth and how they combine with these two hormones. Actually, before I go there,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:49):**  let's back up on just one piece. I mentioned that auxins are produced in two locations. One is in  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:54):**  the shoots and the second is in the seed as the seed is developing. What often happens for many  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:12:59):**  crops is as the seed begins developing, as the fruit begins developing, it becomes the dominant  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:05):**  auxin source and it becomes the dominant sugar sink. Most of the sugars that are being produced  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:12):**  are moving into the fruit, which is appropriate as long as not so many sugars are moving into the  
**[0:13:18-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:18):**  fruit that they are sabotaging root growth and sabotaging shoot growth. The root growth and the  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:26):**  shoot growth will be the first to get less sugar. The sugar is always going to move into the fruit  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:33):**  because the plant has a desire to reproduce. We can monitor sugar production, photosynthesis,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:40):**  and the overall energy of a plant or a tree by monitoring the shoot growth while we have  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:48):**  fruit on the plant or on the tree. If we're growing blueberries or cherries or stone fruit  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:54):**  or apples, it doesn't really matter. The same principle holds true. We want to have the new  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:13:59):**  shoot tips constantly growing as long as there is fruit on the tree. It doesn't need to be growing  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:05):**  rapidly, but we never want it to set the terminal bud. The moment the growing shoots set their  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:10):**  terminal bud, we know that has happened because the plant did not have enough energy to both fill  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:19):**  the fruit and maintain shoot growth. We can actually look at shoot growth and shoot extension  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:24):**  as an indicator for whether a plant had enough energy. There's another aspect to this as well,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:31):**  which is the shoot growth is actually not the first to drop off and to decline. It's actually  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:37):**  the root growth, which is the first to be sacrificed. Because shoots are producing oxen  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:44):**  and seeds are producing oxen, but the roots are not producing oxen. The oxen concentration  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:49):**  in the root system is the first to decline, which means that it is the sugar sink which will get  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:14:55):**  the least amount of sugar and will no longer be supplied sugar first when the plant cannot produce  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:01):**  enough to fully fill the fruit load that it has on the tree. What this means for annual plants  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:07):**  in particular, and to some degree perennials as well, is when the root system no longer gets enough  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:15):**  sugars in every 24-hour photoperiod. It no longer has the energy to keep growing. So root growth  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:21):**  declines or in many cases stops entirely. Now when the root growth stops, remember you need cytokine  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:28):**  production in growing root tips. So when the growing root tips stop, you no longer have any new  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:34):**  root tip extension. That means you also halt the production of cytokines. Now there is no cytokines,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:40):**  there are no cytokines moving up to the upper parts of the plant to trigger the initiation of  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:45):**  reproductive buds. So on some crops, take tomatoes for example, it's very common to see some  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:15:53):**  are indeterminate tomato varieties that are staked and tied fresh market tomatoes. The field looks  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:00):**  like an absolute pitcher. Every row looks like a hedge. They're 40 to 42 inches tall. The crop  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:06):**  that the top is very dense and it looks like a clipped hedge. You have very tight internode  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:12):**  spacing three to four inches apart. And as the fruit begins sizing and the seed begins producing  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:18):**  a lot of oxen, the root system is no longer getting enough sugar because now the sugar is moving into  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:24):**  the fruit. And all of a sudden you see this rapid shoot extension happening out of the top of the  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:28):**  plant where you get now get internodes where for the first 10 weeks of this plant's life, 10-12  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:33):**  weeks of this plant's life, you have all these tight internodes that are three to four inches  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:36):**  long. And now you get this rapid shoot extension where the shoots are six to eight inches long or  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:42):**  10 to 12 inches long. And all of a sudden this tight clipped hedge appearance becomes very ragged.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:48):**  You have all this shoot extension happening out of the top of the plant. That is your first  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:52):**  indication, your first signal that the root system has gone into decline. There is no longer any  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:16:58):**  active root growth because sugars are all moving into the fruit and no longer moving down to the  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:02):**  root system. When that happens, you see that is the trigger that triggers a lot of root disease  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:10):**  susceptibility. So when you first begin seeing challenges with Phytophthora or Rhizoctonia or  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:16):**  Anthracnose or any number of these various soil borne diseases, it often becomes exacerbated and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:22):**  begins developing quickly when you reach this stage of fruit development because the plant  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:29):**  is not producing enough sugars to sustain both the fruit and the root system. And I should just  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:35):**  clarify that plants, this doesn't need to be the case. This is what is common. This is what is  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:40):**  normal, but it's not what needs to be the case. It is possible plants have the genetic capacity  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:45):**  to photosynthesize to much higher levels and be able to fill a fruit load and be able to sustain  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:53):**  constant root growth and root development throughout the entire fruit fill period.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:17:57):**  So circling all the way back to understanding the synergies between nutrients and hormones,  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:04):**  there are of the four vegetative nutrients, three of them have a synergistic relationship with  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:11):**  Oxen. They drive rapid vegetative development and they drive Oxen formation. Those three nutrients  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:18):**  are nitrate, potassium and chloride. So when a plant has a generous supply of nitrate, potassium  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:26):**  and or chloride, either of those three can trigger this response. This is when you get very rapid

**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:37):**  internode spacing where you will have internodes that are six to eight inches apart or longer,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:42):**  depending on what plant or crop we're talking about. But the fourth of these vegetative  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:48):**  nutrient drivers, calcium does not have a synergistic relationship with Oxen. Instead,  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:18:54):**  it has a synergistic relationship with cytokine. So this is kind of the secret. You can achieve  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:01):**  the same amount of shoot extension when you use calcium to drive your vegetative growth as you  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:07):**  can when you use nitrate or potassium or chloride. But instead of having internodes that are spaced,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:13):**  that are widely spaced, you now have internodes that are very tightly spaced because you have  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:17):**  cytokine and dominance instead of Oxen dominance. And this is also how you produce high carbon wood  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:23):**  on perennial tree crops and berries, et cetera. So the key, kind of the bottom line,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:29):**  if I were to summarize it all and wrap it all up very neatly, if you want to produce plants that  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:37):**  tree structure and plant structure that can support and sustain a heavy fruit load and  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:43):**  be extremely reproductive and extremely healthy while also getting strong vegetative growth,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:50):**  high quality vegetative growth at the same time, you want to balance plant nutrition in such a  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:19:55):**  fashion so that you have cytokine and dominance and calcium dominance at the same time. In other  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:01):**  words, you want to get your vegetative growth energy from calcium instead of from nitrate  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:08):**  and potassium and chloride. You still need those nutrients, nitrate and potassium in particular on  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:14):**  some crops. So I'm not suggesting you discontinue the use of those. But instead of using those  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:19):**  nutrients to get your vegetative growth response, when you use calcium to get your vegetative growth  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:24):**  response, you can achieve the same quantity of growth, but a much higher quality growth. And that  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/vegetative-and-reproductive-nutrients-with-john-kempf/#t=0:20:31):**  is the bottom line for producing exceptional yields and quality at the same time. Thanks for

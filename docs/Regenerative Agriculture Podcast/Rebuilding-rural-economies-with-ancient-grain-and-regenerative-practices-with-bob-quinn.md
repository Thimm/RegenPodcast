### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2020-07-15)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast,  where we talk about the agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate  plant health and that regenerate soil health, and ultimately that regenerate public health.  I've been looking forward to having this guest join us for a while, Bob Quinn, an organic farmer  from Montana, who is becoming a bit more famous and should become a lot more famous soon, I hope.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  Bob, I've been really impressed with the work that you're doing with Chemut and all the work  that you've done. I've been looking forward to having you here, so thank you for joining me.  Well, John, it's a thrill for me and a real honor, so I'm looking forward to our visit.  Bob, a month or so ago, in the middle of July, we had a field day in Iowa that you contributed to  in a very significant way, even though you weren't there. You know, often when you're at an all-day  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  conference, you have a really good lunch with desserts and pie and ice cream and potatoes and  beef and chicken or whatever it might be, and after an hour-long lunch, you're going back into  the conference and you want to take a nap because you have all that food sitting in your stomach.  And I've always felt that this is a real downside and that we should specifically try to,  for both the presenters' benefit but also for the people who put in the time and the effort  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  and spent the money to be there, if they're there to learn, you can't really learn very well when  you're half asleep. And so we spent some time trying to specifically design a menu that would  make people feel good and give them energy instead of putting them to sleep. And we specifically  requested that all the buns for our grass-fed burgers be made with kamut flour. And we had  a lot of conversations about the buns and kamut grain at the event. You know the best part? This  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  was a two-day event, two lunches. I didn't see a single person take a nap either day.  Wow. Well, we know it's high-energy grain, but I haven't had that kind of a testimonial before.  Thanks a lot. That's very interesting. Well, it was just one piece of many, I'm sure,  but it was a very important piece because I think a lot of grains do give people a sugar flush that  can put them to sleep very easily. Well, this is an ancient wheat that we have been studying for  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  about 30 years and intensively for probably the last 15, doing a lot of laboratory research,  a lot of research with medical research hospitals studying chronic disease. And we find there's a  huge difference between what we started with, these ancient grains, and what we have now with  modern wheat and what it does to the body and what it does to the system. And giving people more  energy. Athletes can notice this and several teams in Italy, several soccer teams, I should say, are  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  eating exclusively kamuthi and their pastas and their breads and everything rather than any  modern wheat of any kind. And they find more energy and much quicker rebound after hard  practices. It reduces inflammation. So even inflammation in your muscles when you're  exercising hard, that is also reduced besides inflammation that are tied to chronic disease.  So there's something very different and special about it. And I have an idea that most seeds  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  that we started with, that were created for us, started out this way. And when we started changing  them, just for the only benefit of making more money through more yields and cheaper  prices for the farmer, which is a little bit of a downer, we have unintended consequences that  we're just now beginning to understand and see.  James, the nutritional value, we've changed the way that it interacts with our bodies. There's  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  been lots of different changes. And of course, we'd like to think that we've increased yields,  but that may have come at a cost. Many people don't know your story and your background. Bob,  tell us a little bit about your story as a farmer and as it relates to the story of kamuthi and what  brought you to the work that you're doing today? What has been your pathway?  Well, I was raised in north central Montana on a 2,400 acre wheat and cattle ranch that  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  my grandfather started in 1920. So my father was raised here. I was raised here and I raised all  my kids here. This year we celebrated a hundred years since my grandfather began our farm,  just after the homesteaders were going out. They had come to this part of Montana about 1916.  And by 1920, many of them were going broke already. So my grandfather came in at that point  after World War I. And my upbringing here was typical of the age, I guess you could say. I was,  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  however, more interested in plants than I was in animals. So my passion was gardening and science.  When I got to school, I went to the local schools in Big Sandy, which is a small town of  a thousand then. It's down to 600 now. And graduated and went on to Montana State University,  where I studied botany and plant pathology. I love plants and I love science. So that's how I put  them together. And I just kept on going when I finished a master's at Bozeman at Montana State  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  and went on to UC Davis and finished a PhD in plant biochemistry. I was a little disillusioned  with the way university was working at that point and seemed to be more focused on getting grants  than there was on cooperating with each other to test science. And I decided to come home and join  with my father in farming. And soon our whole farm became my laboratory. I was doing experiments,  done experiments for 40 years as we farmed here. After my father retired, I started experimenting  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  with regenerative organic systems. We didn't call it regenerative in those days, but that's what it  was. We were using legumes to build our soils and then once every other year and then the off years  we would grow our cash crop. So we were trying to build our soils and focus on the soils. And we  started that in about 86. So we've been 34 years organic. And at about the same time, realizing  that, a couple years before that, realizing that the 5,400 acre farm when it first came back wasn't  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  big enough to support two families, even though it supported one very nicely, I started looking for  other ways that we could add value to the farm and found a cousin in California who was interested in  available to sell my grain to whole grain bakers in Southern California. We had very immediate  success with that and formed a company. My end was Montana Flower and Grain. He took care of sales  and customer relations and I took care of grain procurement and when our farm didn't produce a  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  high enough quality, I found grain that was suitable. The second year that we were in business,  they asked for organic grain and that was my first introduction to organic. And I finally  met some organic farmers and got acquainted that way and then they wanted to sell them stone ground  flowers. So I got a stone mill and put that in our cleaning plant and we were installing milling  the best which I didn't know anything about, but we just learned as we went and added one customer  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  to another until it became quite successful. And then we added this ancient grain to the mix in  about 1988 and it took off and we registered a trademark, which was kamut, which is an ancient  word for wheat in Egyptian. Using that trademark, we marketed this grain as something that was  always guaranteed to customers, always organic, pure, never adulterated, never genetically modified  or mixed with modern wheat in any way. So that was kind of the launch and it just kind of went  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  from there, John, into areas that I would have never expected. Our business grew in Europe much  more than in this country where they were really interested in ancient wheat and now 75 percent of  everything we grow goes to Italy. They make several thousand, probably 2,500 or 3,000 different  products there. Another 10 percent goes the rest of Europe, about 10 percent to the U.S. and 10  percent to a little bit less to Canada. So it's taken me all over the world. I've done experiments  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:08:31):**  all over almost every country where wheat has grown. I've been there to experiment with this  ancient wheat and see how it compares. So it's been a great experience and I've learned a lot  and made lots of friends all over the world. There are so many aspects of the  Camut story that I've heard about from other people and that I've read about in your book  that I want to unwrap. So you chose to trademark the name. What was the inspiration for  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  trademarking rather than doing some other type of variety protection and how has that worked out?  Well, what we saw with spelt, for example, spelt was starting to gain popularity about the same  time. But what people were doing with it was breeding it, crossing it with modern wheat so  they could get higher yields. All these ancient grains don't really yield very much, John,  compared to, well I shouldn't say very much. They have a lower yield potential than modern wheat  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:31):**  that's really been bred for high inputs and high yields. The ancient grains and seeds that have  never been bred that way or selected for that don't really have that as much. What we saw with  spelt is people were crossing with modern wheat but they still called it spelt. Because spelt is  a generic name, it could mean almost anything. When I saw that, I thought, well that's not what  we want. We wanted a mechanism to protect it and to make a guarantee to the public that it is pure  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  and unadulterated and that's why we chose to market and sell it under a trademark. A trademark  is just a guarantee to our customers that it comes with certain promises which we make and  guarantees to them, which I've mentioned to you already like being raised organic and never mixed  with other grains. But it doesn't mean that we have any ownership or control over the seed. The  seed we look at is a gift from our maker and it's available to everybody and they can do what they  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  want with it. But if they're going to go to the market and they want to call it kamuth, then they  need to be part of our program and follow the rules. If they want to call it something else,  they can do whatever they want. So that was our reasoning and our mechanism by which we started  this whole kamuth project. I find it interesting that increasingly trademarks are being used to  protect and to market specific fruit varieties, particularly apples. We now have Cosmic Crisp  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  being marketed very intensely and we've had Honeycrisp historically and more and more I see  different varieties that are being protected with a trademark. I know there are many people who are  thinking about ways to develop markets for unique products. How has that trademarking process worked  out for you? Has that been able to produce the outcomes you were hoping for? Yes, very much so.  So the trademark has been a great success for us. We've had people who have tried to sell kamuth,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  they called something kamuth and it was completely out of our program and the quality was poor and we  were able to stop that. We had complaints from our customers saying, well, your grain has corn in it  and all kinds of other impurities. And we said, well, that's impossible because we don't grow it,  where corn is grown and so it's not clean where corn is even clean. And so we knew that something  was wrong and we traced it back to someone who was licensed to use our trademark but was actually  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  contracting with farmers clear outside our region that we normally grow it. And it was much inferior  and it was of course causing customer complaints. And that's exactly the reason that we have  for registering and using a trademark in the first place so that we could guarantee quality.  And we were able to do it with a trademark and we said to him, you can't ever do that again. And if  you do, you're out of the program. And we didn't stick our lawyers on him or anything. We just told  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  him that that was his, he used up his last chance to not tell the truth. And if he was going to come  stay with us and tell the truth and allow us to audit him every year, we would still welcome them.  But those are the kinds of incidents we've had. There's been a couple others where they just  opted to just go on their own way. And that's fine. I mean, it's their choice. But what we  want to guarantee is quality, John, and so that the people get what they're paying for because  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  the farmers are paid much more for this and the customers pay more. But what they're getting is  a higher value for their increased cost of their end product or even the grain. And that's, we want  to make sure that that's guaranteed. Let's talk about the business side of it a little bit. What  is the scale that you're operating on? How many acres have you been able to impact? And how were  you able to bring about that scale of production? Well, we just went from one year to another.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  My philosophy in doing business is start small and build on your success. I don't have a big  pile of money, so I can't go out and just try great big experiments. I try small experiments.  And if they're successful, then I build on those. And that's what we did. We started with a half an  acre, which is all the seeds that we had in 1988 when we first planted it in the field at that  rate. Thirty years later, we were contracting with 250 regenerative organic farmers in Montana,  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  Alberta, and Saskatchewan for over 100,000 acres of this stuff. So that really, really made an  impact on organic farming in the upper Great Plains because we only, well, we require that  our farmers not plant more than 20% of their farm, of their crop acres to this grain, even though  it's probably the most valuable crop they can grow so that we do not disturb their rotations.  So they have ample opportunities to have a four or five or six year rotation, which works best with  
**[0:14:25-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  regenerative organic agriculture. And we also require them to plant a soil building legume,  preferably a legume crop or some mixed cover crop with legumes in it the year before  they plant their cash crop of kalut brand wheat. And by doing that, we know they're going to have  good quality to build their soil, so it turns into good quality. And so we are making sure that our  growers really are using regenerative practices. They're not certified that way, but they are under  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  contract to at least for that one year that they're going for us to follow or to appreciate  it with a soil building practice. I really believe in the regenerative organic agriculture and try to  promote it every way I can. And this is a good way that we've been able to promote it and then help  those that have made the jump and made the commitment to do it themselves. So if you are  contracting 20% of their acres and 100,000 acres total, that means you're impacting half a million  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:15:23):**  acres, which is a very significant impact. There's not many people here in North America at this  stage, I don't believe that have impacted that number of acres and facilitating a transition.  That leads me to ask the question, how did you bring that about? And from conversations we've  had in the past, I believe the answer is pricing and economic incentives. So how have you priced  the production of this grain? And then also how does that connect to the marketing?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  Well, as I mentioned, John, I'm a long-term farmer and I know that farmers are preyed upon by  buyers most of the time and never can get enough to really advance profitably in their farms. They're  always living on the edge. And so when we started this whole grain project, I wanted something that  people could make a profit from and be happy with and have some satisfaction financially from  growing it and putting the effort in. So we decided to just arbitrarily set the price of  
**[0:16:24-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  the grain that we were buying at three times the highest market for non-organic grain it was for  wheat at that time, which is about $3 about 30 years ago. And so we set the price at $9 a bushel  and the growers were very excited about that. Most of the organic grain was going for about twice  the price of non-organic wheat in those days. So this is a significant jump even over the organic  prices. And as we went, we were able to increase that even more. And so now it's been as much as  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:16:59):**  five times. And that has come a little bit in the consequence of competing for acres. When we  started to grow and require more acres and there are other demands on wheat, we found that we  sometimes ended up in a bidding war with farmers. And as long as our end users were able to make it  work for them, because it has to work for everybody. The other part of my business  philosophy is that everybody wins. And if the customer can't sell it, if it's overpriced,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  so he can't sell it, then he can't win either. So it won't go on. It won't be sustainable.  And we worked very closely with our buyers and manufacturers and helped them with understanding  the higher value that this grain had. And a lot of people who couldn't eat modern wheat  found they could eat it. So they understood immediately the higher value it had. And  many of them that ate it could feel the difference in their bodies, just as you were mentioning  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  with people not going to sleep. People could feel the higher energy. People could notice right away  that there wasn't any problem with digestion or cramps or something to say that many have with  sensitivities to modern wheat. So that was something that wasn't just smoke mirrors or fancy  marketing. It was just explaining to people what we had discovered and then asking them to try it  themselves and see if they could feel the difference and taste the difference. It also is  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  very tasty, has a great flavor and aromas. And that was also a help to us. How did the economics  end up working out for the growers? You mentioned that you're today at five times the price, if I  understood correctly, the commodity wheat price. You also mentioned a bit ago in our conversation  that the yields are smaller with these ancient grains and they don't have the same yield  potential. So how do the economics end up working out for the farmer at the end of the day on a per  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  acre profitability potential? Generally the average in the Durham growing, it grows best  down where Durham goes best. And so where there's a good history of Durham being successful,  like in Northeast Montana, South Central and Southeast Saskatchewan, the yields are not so  much different. Maybe five, ten percent and maybe some years it's just even and even a little bit  more sometimes. But it averages about 10 percent less. Further away you get from that it could be  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:25):**  up to 20 percent and that would be 25 at the most. And that's compared to spring wheat now because  it's a spring grain. Our winter grains where they can grow winter wheat is using much higher  yield and so when the people are comparing those two it's not really apples to apples.  It's spring wheat to winter wheat and so the yield in the same area is going to be quite a bit  different. But since it's a spring wheat and those different spring wheat areas we don't have that  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  comparison too often. So if it if they have a 20 percent less yield and you're getting four to  five times more per bushel you're coming out very well and then with organic cost of organic  production for grains in the upper grade plains is normally one-third to one-half less depending  on how much of inputs you are growing with with your chemical agriculture. You're not buying those  expensive inputs and you're growing your own inputs. We see a significant reduction in the  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  cost of your farm organic regenerative organic systems. So you're really gaining on both ends  of it higher price lower inputs and that more than covers the small decrease in yields. Our yields are  also something that's variable with the weather. So if we're under a severe drought this grain  actually will out yield because it has some drought resistance it will out yield modern wheat  and chemical agriculture. If we're having just an average year then it will be pretty close. I mean  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  then you're closer you're 10 percent. If we're having a very successful year with really good  range or extra range the yield potential of modern wheat and also with chemical agriculture  does exceed organic by 20, 30, 40 percent. But you're into really good yields and so it's not a  detriment it's just maybe you could have you're coming closer to being a similar economic situation  with your chemical neighbors on those extremely plentiful years. But they don't come very often  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  and maybe one year and five is that way. And the average though you're much better off over the  long haul under the average. When you were describing how the distribution of this grain  you mentioned that the majority 80 percent if I understood correctly is going to Europe in total  with Italy being a significant proportion of that.

One thing that you find in Europe is more interest in organic  in the first place than in America. Even though we have a higher dollar value we sell in America  it's because we have so many more people that are buying it. But our percent of organic food  that's sold in America is around six percent. Many countries in Europe are exceeding that some  double and some triple that almost. But in Italy which led the way for our big growth in the world

And to them it is just like the old timers tell me it's like pasta that they used to have.  And remember even before World War II the smell of it in the factory as it's being manufactured  is something that they once had and then lost and now they have it back again. So they're very big  interest in this and they're very very critical and picking about the quality of their food. And

And  it carries true not just to pasta but to breads and cookies and cakes and seitan for meat substitutes  and all kinds of other things are making syrup with a grain syrup or making milk or drink like  rice milk and with that they can make ice cream and cheeses.

What is the nutritional value for us as consumers of this  grain as compared to modern grain? Has anyone been looking at that? Well we've looked at specific  aspects and we did chemical analysis minerals and nutritional profile with proteins and fatty acids  and all the things that go into those nutritional profiles and we didn't really see things we didn't  as a whole there wasn't anything that really stuck out as being very significant. One thing that we

**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  what you're doing how are things developing for you with dry land non-irrigated vegetable production  what inspired that in the first place well we have in the west uh in the arid west in the northern  great plains areas of alkali that breaks out and covers the ground with alkali salts and makes  white patches and they're called saline seeps and they occur when water is absorbed at a high  like a hilltop or an upper a higher level higher of the field and then seeps down into the field  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  and hits an impervious layer of clay or a really hard sandstone or something it forces it back up  and then it comes back up to the top of the ground with all these dissolved salts it's common to  semi-arid fields and as it evaporates it leaves these salts on top of the ground and it ruins the  soil so what you can do to solve that problem is plant alfalfa around the outside edges between  the what's called the recharge area where the water enters the soil and the breakout area where  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  it comes out during all these salts and if you take the water out of the ground at that point  uh use it in something that's used a lot of water like alfalfa you can um you can cause those  those deep areas to disappear because rain will as it falls will dissolve those salts and take  them back into the ground and if no more is coming out you will eventually heal your soil  and so that's one of the things that we we knew about it that 30 years ago was that was just being

**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  could be known for that region and be a specialty of that region in essence what you're describing  obviously you need to find varieties that are adapted to your fairly northern climate but from  a water perspective if you have a third of the water third of the rainfall and you're spacing  plants out three times farther do you believe that you can achieve the same yields per gallon of  water per inch of rainfall that's what we've seen it's at least it's per plant it's the same yield  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  per plant so we have one third plants and one third of the rainfall so big broad brush strokes  you could say is pretty close to a direct proportion so where you're having three times  more rain and we having to produce three times more in the field than we can it's a pretty close  proportion how important is seed quality to achieving that type of performance i know one  of the things that i've observed is that many older varieties what people refer to as heirloom  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  varieties of vegetables have much more robust root systems and they're much better capable of  absorbing nutrients they're just simply hardier as you described with your kamut grain whenever it is  found it's best if you have a drought year it tends to perform better and the same holds true  of all the older varieties so what have you experienced and observed with your vegetable  varieties and and also with the kamut in terms of the importance of seed quality well i think seed

**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:48:04):**  healthy modern seed too probably that's resistant to disease and it has good germination and all  that kind of stuff it's healthy but a super seed what you're referring to in the heirloom varieties  that can perform better under stress many times they have more aromas and more flavors and what  they produce and from our research we've come to understand very clearly that aromas and flavors  are due to secondary metabolites in plants that plants make such as polyphenols and polyphenols  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:48:38):**  are very very directly related to anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties that are  very very important for good health so just by the fact of a plant tasting better and smelling  more delicious probably are getting a higher nutrition out of that plant and that is a genetic  by and large a genetic thing so if you add genetics to the way you're farming and the  health of the soil you're adding a super seed to healthy soil you're ending up with super healthy

**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  we're going to add value to something and therefore improve it but if you think about  adding value to something like grain the only reason we have to add value to it and and what  we've done a perfect example of that is what we've done to white flour so white flour is fortified  we add value to white flour by adding back minerals and vitamins that were there in the first  place but you wouldn't have to add them back if they hadn't been taken out in the first place  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  and removed by the refining process in this case of making white flour out of whole grain this is  a very big step backwards and you cannot add value back and still end up to the same place as you  started with before you started subtracting value by taking things away from the food the same idea  could it be a by the soils if you never ever do anything to build up your soil but just take away  from it all the time you are going to decrease and decrease and decrease its value you're depleting  
**[0:51:43-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  its value and just by adding artificial chemicals nitrogen or phosphorus or potassium and zinc and  some of these other things it's not the same if you're focusing on feeding the plant rather than  feeding the soil and that's what we do with regenerative organic agriculture is try to feed  the soil and let the soil feed the plant and we don't focus so much on feeding the plant because  in actuality and you're an expert at this john you know that the plant nutrition is coming from a  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  living soil and the microbes and all the activity in the soil is actually what's feeding the plant  properly and when you put artificial minerals that you think the plant needs and of course it does  need some of those does nitrogen it does need calcium phosphorus and some of these other  macronutrients for sure if that's your only focus and think you can just overload the soil profile  so the plant has enough of its essential minerals it's really going through it backwards and as a  
**[0:52:41-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  result you're doing it because you have decreased the value of the soil in the first place you've  degraded the soil and this is a crutch you're trying to use to get back to it but it's a long  way to go back the way to go back is to try to add value keep the value that was there in the first  place and if you've lost it then try to get back to the type of state that you had originally what  you're describing essentially is that mainstream agriculture the way that it has been practiced  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:53:08):**  for the last seven or eight decades has been subtracting value from our soil and subtracting  value from the food stuff that we are producing because of constantly lower nutritional value  because of things we're taking out of it yes i was also really intrigued by the story that you shared  of how you set out to produce oil for biodiesel to produce your own energy and ended up producing a  food product that then became fuel as well can you tell us a little bit about that story and  
**[0:53:43-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  how that came to be well that's an example of not value subtracting right so i had an idea when the  first fuel crisis was was uh hitting us soon after we moved back to the farm in the very late  70s and early 80s and there was a lot of talk of growing our own fuel and that most of it was  dealing with ethanol and ethanol production but we didn't really we weren't really suited that we  couldn't we can't grow corn here it didn't make as much sense to do that with other grains but  
**[0:54:18-0:54:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  the thing that intrigued me was oil seeds there was a big um possibility that we could use oil  seeds than to make biodiesel and run our diesel engines with it and that was my goal i started  out with um camelina because it was a grain that is very very productive here it can be planted  very early it's uh in the mustard family similar to canola but canola cannot be planted so early  because um it's more susceptible to frost but by the time it starts to flower we're in the heat of

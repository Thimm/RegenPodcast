### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kampf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:11):**  to diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:16):**  a legitimate conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:21):**  people with incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:27):**  regenerative agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:33):**  resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:40):**  topics that you would like for me to discuss, please connect on LinkedIn or on Twitter, where

**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:01:54):**  very much like to hear from you and to hear your feedback. Be sure to subscribe to this podcast,

**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:04):**  Many great growers have had the experience of walking through a block of fruit or through a  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:09):**  field of vegetables and saying something like something just doesn't quite feel right. This  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:15):**  block is off. It's sometimes hard to quantify, but we know that something doesn't feel right.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:21):**  What if you could tap into what your crop is attempting to communicate? In this episode,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:26):**  I'm delighted to host a good friend Pascal Fafard. Pascal is a consultant in Quebec,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:32):**  as you'll be able to hear from his awesome accent, and is in very high demand to work with the  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:37):**  largest vegetable growers in the region. While Pascal has decades of experience and a background  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:43):**  in agronomy, his consulting work is not focused on managing insects or managing nutrition.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:50):**  Instead, he helps growers figure out how to tap into what is happening with their soils and plants,  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:02:56):**  and how to determine what is going on when things just don't feel quite right. This is a very  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:03:01):**  important topic, a very different topic from our typical agronomy science focus, but one that I  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:03:06):**  believe is very important and that you'll greatly appreciate and enjoy. This season, like the last,

**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:13):**  Hi friends. I'm here with a consultant who is loved by his growers for his work as a coaching  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:18):**  consultant. Pascal Fafard has a fascinating story and I think a story that is very relevant for all  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:25):**  of us as growers and as consultants. One of the most important things that we can do in working  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:32):**  with plants is remembering that the image that we hold in our mind of success, what success looks  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:40):**  like, and the space that we come from within can have a tremendous impact on the crops that we're  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:46):**  growing, on the people that we interact with every day. Pascal has a fascinating story, has done some  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:51):**  very interesting work in this area that I wanted to share with all of you. Pascal, thank you very  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:05:55):**  much for joining us today, for being here and for sharing your story. We're very excited to have you.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:00):**  Thank you very much, John. It's a pleasure. Pascal, can you tell us a little bit about your  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:06):**  background and what has led you to the work that you're doing today?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:10):**  Yeah, sure. First, I am an agronomist. I made my studies at university for four years.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:19):**  I have been working for 10 years. Mainly, I think I learned to learn because most of my expertise,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:29):**  I really found it in the field with growers, with other advisors, and in general with my life.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:37):**  So, I've been working 10 years in a group of consultants doing IPM, Integrated Pest Management.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:45):**  My goal was to look at the farms and reduce pesticide. I learned a lot there on the methodology  
**[0:06:53-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:06:53):**  to look on the very scientific, but counting the disease to decide if we reach the appropriate level  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:03):**  to take an action. But most of the time, the action was put a pesticide, insecticide,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:10):**  fungicide to kill something. After some time, I realized I was ready for a new area, a new way to  
**[0:07:21-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:21):**  deal with the farms, with the grower. I quit. I started to work for two years using a different  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:33):**  product coming from Germany. The name of the product is not important, but it was more now  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:39):**  on building something. So, product to promote health of the plant, health of the soil,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:46):**  the microbiology, and really building something. So, I think it's probably at this moment,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:53):**  the guy who was using those products was a naturopath. Is that a good word? Sorry for  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:07:59):**  my English. Is that a good word in English? Yeah. So, he teach me, he brought me a new way to look at  
**[0:08:06-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:06):**  the farms as something living. So, the soil would be as similar as the digestive system. So, you  
**[0:08:16-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:16):**  want to help it to work in the proper way so that the plant received the proper nutrient. So, for  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:24):**  me, it was a shift and I was ready for that. But all along my career, I met so wonderful people who  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:31):**  bring their richness, their expertise, who make who I am now. Anyway, so, I've been there for  
**[0:08:37-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:37):**  two days and after what I was seeing is, yes, I'm working more with the nature, but I see so many  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:45):**  grower stress with child or the next generation who just don't want to take the farm because they  
**[0:08:53-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:08:53):**  see their parents or their father doing 100, 120 hour per week, being stressed, not fully fulfilled.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:02):**  And I'm talking about good farms, really successful farms in the area from 100 to 500  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:10):**  acre of vegetable mostly, very established enterprise, but still with a lack of happiness.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:17):**  So, based on those experiences, I decided to take care specifically of the grower, family,  
**[0:09:25-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:25):**  business grower, and put aside all the agriculture for two years. So, it was a good opportunity for  
**[0:09:33-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:33):**  me to really feel the challenge that experience of a farmer, a grower. Yes, grow plants, but manage  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:45):**  a team of employee, do the marketing, do the sale, repair the machinery, create new machinery.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:09:52):**  So, so many domains that they have to be really good. And what I felt is there was a lack in  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:00):**  staying connected to what is their first passion. So, after those two or three years of coaching, I  
**[0:10:06-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:06):**  came back as a consultant, but more in a way to teach first because my main goals in, it's a big  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:18):**  answer for a small question, but my main goals is really to bring back autonomy to the grower  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:24):**  because that's their farms. So, I start more to develop kind of services that we're going to talk  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:32):**  later to bring back autonomy. And I really think it starts with educate and teach and make sure  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:40):**  that the basic function of the soil and the plant is understood.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:45):**  So, Pascal, you're describing yourself as being in the area of bringing autonomy to the grower  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:51):**  and you're working with fruit and vegetable growers in Quebec, which is, we can hear from  
**[0:10:58-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:10:58):**  your accent. What are some of the memorable moments that led you to do the work that you're  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:09):**  doing today? And when you describe bringing autonomy to a grower, what does that really  
**[0:11:14-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:14):**  mean to you? Yeah. First, as I said, I think since I was 25 years old, the first time that my  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:23):**  older brother told me, you know, Pascal, life is just incredible. The only advice I can give you  
**[0:11:31-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:31):**  is do course, experiment, you know, learn because life is so much complex that we can see it,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:42):**  but it's so exciting to go through it with a mindset of discovering. And naturally,  
**[0:11:51-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:11:51):**  since 20 years, I really open-minded to new ways to see life, to understand life. As I said,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:02):**  I love people. I really try to see people for their own color and get the gift that they have  
**[0:12:10-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:10):**  to share naturally and in their unique color. Based on that, you know, you are a person that  
**[0:12:19-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:19):**  first time I met you, I receive a lot on your way to see life, your capacity to explain in detail  
**[0:12:28-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:28):**  something so complex, example, the photosynthesis of the plant. But why is this process is there  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:36):**  for the plant? And put it in perspective. So people, as you bring a richness to my life  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:44):**  to help me to become who I am now, it's a process. It will never end and I'm really excited  
**[0:12:50-0:13:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:12:50):**  because it keeps moving and also it brings me a sense of humility. You know, if there is  
**[0:13:00-0:13:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:00):**  something I want to say today, I'm not here to say the truth. I have one truth and my only desire  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:09):**  when you offer me this opportunity is just open new possibility to the grower and if there is  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:15):**  something or resonate in themselves in what I say, just take it. If there is something that doesn't  
**[0:13:21-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:21):**  talk to you, just put it back, throw it in the garbage. And it's really an opportunity to look  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:29):**  at your own relationship with your friends, with your family, with your employee, with the nature  
**[0:13:35-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:35):**  and look if you can get a gift and add it to your own tools. Pascal, when you were working with a  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:45):**  grower and coaching, as you describe it, what exactly is the scope of the coaching? What are  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:50):**  you really doing with the growers that you're working with? Okay, first I have really a focus  
**[0:13:58-0:14:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:13:58):**  to what is the priority on the farms. So when I arrive on the farm, usually I really try to find  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:08):**  what's working and where there is an opportunity to improve. So sometimes I'm going to talk about  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:14):**  the field, the fertility, sometimes I can, you know, we have a problem at the harvest time and  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:21):**  example, the plants are not at the same stage. So I have a feeling that, okay, maybe we need to go  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:27):**  back to the planting time or the seeding time and we can go back and just walk behind the machinery  
**[0:14:34-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:34):**  and get information to find a good diagnostic about the situation. So I really try with the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:44):**  grower to get an overview of his farm and find opportunity to improve. I look at it in different  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:14:53):**  aspects. What is success? You know, when I started as an agronomist 25 years ago, it was  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:02):**  no damage of the insect or having a good yield. It is still something very important.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:10):**  But now I had other aspects as you have fun, you have pleasure to do your work as a grower.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:18):**  Are you still connected to that passion that brought you to the farms or to follow what your  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:23):**  parents did or I don't know, no matter if you start your own business or if you're a second or  
**[0:15:29-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:29):**  third generation. Are you employees also fulfilled? Are they expressing their full potential?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:40):**  Because I really think that it's when everybody bring their own richness and is in the good place  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:46):**  in the farms that we have the most chance to have success in every area. Clearly profitability is  
**[0:15:54-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:15:54):**  important. I saw a lot of growers work hard, really hard, being really committed, but they had a lack  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:06):**  to just step back sometimes. Do I put my time, my energy at a good place? For me, it was a big  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:15):**  revelation. Is that a good word in English? Yeah. Revelation to the good place.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:21):**  Revelation to see that, wow, I expect that some people who are on their farm for 10, 15, 20 years  
**[0:16:33-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:33):**  would know their farm very well. I'm not saying that they don't know nothing, but what I realize  
**[0:16:41-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:41):**  is a grower, a farmer is not different than a businessman in any area. Things can go fast,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:50):**  life can go fast, and sometimes it's easy to go on the automatic pilot and lose that awareness  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:16:58):**  that's going to help you to hope, oh, something going on here. I need to look more closer or  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:04):**  I need some help to really understand what's going on. Once I get the information and I know what's  
**[0:17:11-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:11):**  going on, now I can maybe adapt my strategy and make it happen. So following up on what you just  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:22):**  described, what does success look like for you? What does a successful grower look like? Yeah,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:29):**  I really think the biggest way from what I saw with my grower is are they fulfilled?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:37):**  Are they fulfilled in what they are doing? What I realize is when my grower slow down,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:48):**  take moment to go in the field, take moment to have an overview of their farms, look the employee,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:17:55):**  ask the question, is that person, is the good person at a good place? I really see that a new  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:02):**  state of peace of mind come for them. They take better decision because they got better  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:09):**  information at first. They attract different things too. We didn't talk about it before, but  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:18):**  I teach also to my grower that I truly believe that our farms, our life is made of energy.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:26):**  No matter your religion or your spirituality, I think if you are a grower or a consultant in  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:32):**  agriculture, we accept the fact that there is something bigger with an awareness and we can  
**[0:18:39-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:39):**  call it God or universe or energy or nature, but there is something bigger that bring life or make  
**[0:18:49-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:18:49):**  life happen. As a human being, we are part of that world, of that system. What I observed  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:00):**  during those years is, okay, you need to work with your mind, with your rationality, but you  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:08):**  need also to develop your intuition, your connection to the nature. I think it's when you  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:13):**  put both together that you get the best result. If I go back to your question, I think when I  
**[0:19:20-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:20):**  observe that one of my grower become more fulfilled, happy, it's because naturally all  
**[0:19:29-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:29):**  the other aspect got in place. He is proud of the field, good yield, good quality. He is proud of  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:39):**  the way he grow it. I'm not working with only an organic grower. I take all the people and I take  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:47):**  from where they are and naturally we evolve to work more with the nature because I think that's  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:53):**  the more efficient way to produce good yield and good quality, but it's also the most natural way  
**[0:19:59-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:19:59):**  as a human being to be with. They realize that, okay, when I put a pesticide, it is not good  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:08):**  to bring disorder in the soil, on my plant, it's toxic, the cost is always increasing on the market  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:15):**  to buy the product and I'm not building something. So naturally, they think differently, they prepare  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:22):**  the soil, they work with more natural product and after four and two, three, four, five years,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:27):**  they realize, wow, I completely transformed my way of growing. No matter if they are already organic  
**[0:20:34-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:34):**  or not, there is a process going in that direction. Also, I heard a lot of my grower hearing that  
**[0:20:42-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:42):**  now the seller wants their product. I don't know what you're doing on your farm, but that shallot,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:51):**  green onion, the conservation, it's much better in the grocery. So you're a bit higher on your price,  
**[0:20:57-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:20:57):**  but I want to pay it because my customer wants that I buy from you. That's other for me,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:06):**  result of the success. The quality, the seller wants your product, usually the price goes up.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:14):**  Also, profitability is important if we want a long-term success for a farm. But what I realize,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:23):**  if I bring my grower fulfill in what he's doing, that's where you're going to use the most,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:31):**  in the best ways, his potential and it's going to reflect on everything on a direct way and also in  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:38):**  a subtle way as attracting good things on an energetic level. Pascal, I find this to be a very  
**[0:21:46-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:46):**  interesting topic. We don't often hear consultants speaking about fulfillment of farmers and growers  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:21:56):**  and the question that comes to mind is what are the areas that you find most often that growers  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:05):**  are dissatisfied with or that are preventing them from feeling fulfilled in their work?  
**[0:22:11-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:11):**  I think a lot feel often overwhelmed. Running after a list to do that will never end until the  
**[0:22:28-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:28):**  winter arrives. If it ends them. Yeah, exactly. That's a very good point because I know some of  
**[0:22:36-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:36):**  my growers store some vegetables like carotene and they can't keep the same speed. Maybe that  
**[0:22:47-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:47):**  brings me to something I didn't share yet that five years, five times go fast, five or six years  
**[0:22:55-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:22:55):**  ago I've been introduced with a woman, Maya Kincaid from Sedona, Arizona. Maya, since she's  
**[0:23:05-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:05):**  very young, expressed a gift. She can talk telepathically to animals and mainly that's  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:14):**  expertise and enterprise now. She teaches people in business or just individuals to connect with  
**[0:23:22-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:22):**  the nature. She mostly works with animals but one day through a friend we connected and she told us  
**[0:23:32-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:32):**  that she could teach us how to communicate with plants. Naturally, I was really, why not? I heard  
**[0:23:41-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:41):**  so many stories in my life. I've been meditating for many years, not in a constant way but  
**[0:23:50-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:50):**  every two weeks, I don't know. Anyway, I knew that there are many aspects of life that I'm not  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:23:59):**  mastering but it doesn't mean that they don't exist. So for me, when I heard about that woman  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:06):**  that she can communicate with animals and that she answered us that she could teach us how to  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:12):**  communicate with plants, I told myself why not? In the first way, I saw the opportunity as an  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:20):**  agronomist. Wow, if I can communicate with the plants and the plant told me I want more nitrogen,  
**[0:24:25-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:25):**  increase the population, it's going to be much easier to develop a strategy. But it was just,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:34):**  it was nothing about what I've been discovering over the five, six or seven years and I naturally  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:45):**  integrated in my work with my grower. Why am I talking about that? Because at first,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:52):**  I wanted to teach it to the grower to get the information, as I said, but what I realized after  
**[0:24:58-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:24:58):**  I started implementing that technique in grower and farmer's life, they start to slow down  
**[0:25:08-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:08):**  and at least one time a day, take 15, 20 minutes, sometime more, but at least 15 minutes, go in the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:18):**  field and just connect truly with the nature and just that 15 minutes calm the mind, bring more  
**[0:25:30-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:30):**  peace, put some light on the priority and after when they go back to the other usual task that  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:39):**  they have or responsibility they have in the farms, they look at it with a new sense of awareness  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:45):**  and if I go back to the fulfillment, they are in a relationship with the challenge of being a farmer  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:25:52):**  in a much more calmer and quiet way. So instead of being rushed and always reacting,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:01):**  they start to dance and you know like surfing with the wave, they start to dance with challenge  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:08):**  and naturally after weeks, months or years of practice, they are completely in a different place.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:17):**  They are much more powerful to deal with the responsibility and the challenge of being, yes,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:25):**  it's beautiful to be a farmer but that's a reality and I'm sure all the person who are listening now,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:30):**  they experience some time that that stuff, you know, the climate, the sales are just growing,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:38):**  there is a lot of challenge but what I saw is with bringing that skills, you can completely  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:47):**  transform your relationship in a good way to your farms. Pascal, talking to plants,  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:26:53):**  this is a fascinating skill that I've heard other people speak about. One of my mentors,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:00):**  Bruce Tainio was very gifted at speaking with plants. Bruce is unfortunately no longer living  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:05):**  but I'm really intrigued. Tell us a little bit more about what is the experience like  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:11):**  in communicating with plants and what are the types of things that you learn?  
**[0:27:15-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:15):**  As I said, that's my truth. I don't say it to force it. I'm just sharing what I have experienced,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:26):**  what I notice. At first, it was a knowledge that someone teach me, I don't know the verb in past  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:33):**  dance. It's an English course for me now. Anyway, someone who teaches me English,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:40):**  I had it with my own past experience about meditation. In my personal life, for many years,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:48):**  I love to go and hike in the mountains or in nature. When you are in nature, naturally,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:27:56):**  you slow down, you start observing the bird. We develop a new technique called the  
**[0:28:01-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:01):**  nature. For example, in the spring, the nature is like awakening. We can feel something happening.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:22):**  It's not something weird or bizarre. We feel there is a new sense of life growing.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:37):**  Another thing, sometimes I'm sure you're going to feel, I don't know why there is a problem  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:43):**  some here. I cannot point it out right now but something wrong or the opposite. Oh, wow.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:50):**  I don't know. That field is so alive. I'm really excited to see it at the time of harvest because,  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:28:57):**  wow, that's wonderful.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:00):**  You're absolutely right, Pascal. Both of those things, when you walk into a field in the springtime,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:06):**  the air feels different. There's songbirds singing and there is a burst of vitality and energy that  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:12):**  happens in the spring that is very observable. Also, I couldn't agree more with the second  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:17):**  comment that you made. I couldn't begin to recall all the times that we have walked with a grower  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:24):**  through an orchard or through a field and the girl will say something like,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:28):**  this block just doesn't feel right. Something is not right. I'm not sure what it is,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:33):**  but this block just doesn't feel right. At first, honestly, when I got the course,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:38):**  I remember it was late August 2011. I remember the name. Wow, it's kind of wild. I told the first  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:48):**  course it was by phone. If I go through the process, it was really easy. I expect a very  
**[0:29:54-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:29:54):**  complex technique but what Maya told us is, okay, at first, just be aware of your mind. Do you have  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:02):**  expectations? Do you have other worries on your day? What I developed after is, okay, I put all  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:09):**  my worry, I put it aside. It's like I'm talking to myself and I'm going to take you back later,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:15):**  but now I'm going to just experience something. She gave us an example to remind a positive and  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:22):**  a negative souvenir just to observe, to connect to the emotion inside and to realize, to be aware  
**[0:30:29-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:29):**  that, okay, there is something going on in my body and it's emotion. What's emotion? Again,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:37):**  it's energy. You could say that the flow of the blood increase or, yeah, that's the physical part,  
**[0:30:45-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:45):**  but what's emotion? That's energy. That's something subtle. Second step, we just accept  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:30:55):**  the fact that we can't communicate with any living organism. In my believing, I really believe  
**[0:31:04-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:04):**  every living organism as a soul or a consciousness. Usually, I don't put much importance to the world.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:13):**  I just try to describe that something and I know it exists and that's the way I go in life. I want  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:23):**  to know the basic, but I don't, in French, we have an expression, on the St. Franschpont,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:31):**  a les flores du Tepi. I'm sure you don't understand the French or the way I said it,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:36):**  but the point is you don't give too much importance to the detail. You just get the overview  
**[0:31:42-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:42):**  and that's the main goals. So, we accept the fact that we can't communicate with plants.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:53):**  So, I was in my city. My other friend was in another city in Quebec and Maya was in Sedona,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:31:58):**  Arizona. The way we did it is that she asked us to prepare a list of plants, insects,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:06):**  fields that you want to communicate with. I use the word communicate because talk for me sometimes  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:14):**  and for some person, it's harder to accept the concept because talk, we say automatically that  
**[0:32:20-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:20):**  we, there is a sound. For me, usually, it's more in my mind. It's like more telepathic.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:29):**  It's, yeah, sometimes you can talk. So, I know some growers prefer to talk, but I just want to  
**[0:32:34-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:34):**  say that it's a kind of communication. Anyway, tell me if I go too much in detail. So, we're  
**[0:32:42-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:42):**  having this conversation to go into detail. So, at that first course, I have to be honest,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:52):**  I have a small doubt. I was really open-minded and honestly, I had to talk with the person and  
**[0:32:58-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:32:58):**  I saw she was a grounded person, nice personality. So, for me, she showed me the sign of someone I  
**[0:33:07-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:07):**  can have confidence. So, anyway, I'm going to try it and we see what happened. And I still remember  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:15):**  the first communication, I choose a field of corn one hour away from my city. It was a customer that  
**[0:33:22-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:22):**  I had and we had some trials where we test some new product and those products in general promote  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:31):**  really good result, but on that field, there was no result. So, I had the idea that why we don't  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:41):**  talk with the field and we have a very practical example. So, the way we did it,  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:50):**  Maya asked, okay, I'm going to ask the question. We wait for two minutes and we observe  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:33:56):**  what we get and after we share our answer, both all three of us. So, the question was something  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:03):**  like how we can help you or something similar. So, she said it and right away we observe on our  
**[0:34:12-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:12):**  our home side, in our home, what show up. And for me, right away, I got the I don't need your help.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:21):**  I don't need your help. And clearly, I could feel it was not myself talking to me because it could  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:29):**  be one of your questions. Are you sure it's not your mind? And I could feel there wasn't a  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:37):**  different personality bringing me some thoughts and I start laughing. What's going on?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:45):**  And what, you know, I was ready to receive a beautiful, nice answer. Oh, you could tell to  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:34:53):**  buy grow her to pay more natural change. No, that's I don't need your help. So, I start laughing.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:01):**  Anyway, after two minutes, we share our answer and I think I was the first and I share that and  
**[0:35:08-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:08):**  then I got a strong I don't need your help and I start laughing and I start just dancing with that  
**[0:35:18-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:18):**  first answer and inside my mind, I told myself, oh, why that corn is saying me that? At the moment,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:28):**  I ask a question, I receive an answer. Probably not from the corn at that time but from a higher  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:34):**  level and as I said for me, it was not important. I'm noticing that I was connecting to a higher  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:41):**  level of consciousness in a very practical way and there was an opportunity to explore there.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:49):**  And the first answer I got from why is he answering me? It was, yeah, maybe it was a  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:35:55):**  pretty fast and straight introduction. You know, you don't know who we are. I didn't  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:01):**  introduce myself and I noticed that my intention was to get answered to take care of my customer.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:09):**  Honestly, I didn't care so much about the corn itself. So, anyway, we share the answer and the  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:18):**  three of us has mostly the same result. Maya and Michael received that why I would answer to you,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:25):**  you don't like corn. So, the same tonality, the same kind of emotion that you disturb me and both  
**[0:36:34-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:34):**  of them shared to me that, wow, I realized with the answer of the corn that Maya and Michael have  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:45):**  in the background believing that there is too much corn on the planet. It's too hard on the soil,  
**[0:36:52-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:36:52):**  it takes water, it's not positive, it's not a positive plant. So, what we realized that, wow,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:02):**  the exploration, the discoveries already started, we noticed that the plant felt judged.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:10):**  So, in the future, if we want to create a nice relationship and develop communication,  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:15):**  we need to respect the organism, the living organism that we want to communicate with it.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:24):**  I don't know if you have a question at that part of my story or I just continue.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:28):**  Well, there's a number of different questions that have come up, but let's continue. I'd love to hear  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:33):**  the end of that and then I'll follow through. Okay, good. So, what comes to my mind now is  
**[0:37:38-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:38):**  maybe some people listening now are maybe, I don't know, that, oh, am I able to do that or  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:49):**  it's almost impossible to believe or, okay, I will not censure, I will express myself freely.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:37:57):**  So, I have two answers to that. First, yes, is that like everything, the more you practice,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:05):**  the better you become. So, my aptitude now, seven years later, is much better than at the beginning.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:16):**  Second, yes, I've done meditation, you know, I've, for many years, I work in nature and so,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:24):**  I develop my sensibility and my awareness. But what I see is I've teach that to  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:33):**  particular, to individual, to any kind of farmer, some very rational people who think everybody  
**[0:38:42-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:42):**  was able to do it, everybody. So, I'm not different. Yes, maybe I reach a level of mastering,  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:50):**  I don't know, and I know people who are much better than me, but the point is everybody, I truly  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:38:57):**  believe in that, is able to do it. One of the questions that I have, Pascal, you express your  
**[0:39:02-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:02):**  desire to learn about and thought you might be able to get answers about nutrient management  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:11):**  or irrigation management and then the answers that you received were actually about your  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:17):**  relationship with the crop rather than about nutrition management in that example that you  
**[0:39:22-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:22):**  shared. What were the types of answers that were common as you continued with this over the years?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:31):**  Very good question. You're a good interviewer, John. I think you should follow on that.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:39):**  Okay, I'm going to answer your question with finishing the story with the corn and I'm going  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:44):**  to bring additional example. With the corn, after that first question and first answer,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:51):**  we realized that, okay, we need to connect with heart, with deep soul, you know, with a good  
**[0:39:59-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:39:59):**  intention with the plant, if we want to receive good answer. So, the second step we did, we  
**[0:40:08-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:08):**  introduced ourselves. So, the corn was not able to see me, so I'm a human, I am an agronomist,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:17):**  I like my grower, I like the corn, the plant, and I'm really interested to know more about you.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:24):**  And I could feel, you know, the energy changing. For me, I see no difference, okay, mostly,  
**[0:40:35-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:35):**  but really mainly a plant or an animal or a human is mostly the same. It's living, it wants to have  
**[0:40:45-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:45):**  a purpose in life, there is emotion. So, in that specific case, the corn, he felt like attack,  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:53):**  so he protect himself, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't walk on my feet and who are you, where are  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:40:59):**  you coming from? So, after a second step, just introduced, I could feel the protection  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:06):**  energetically going down and I could feel, he feel my desire really to take care of him.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:14):**  And at the end, what we got, because it was a short conversation, but if you want to help me,  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:22):**  the only things I can tell you, don't put more of us in the field, it's already too much crowded.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:30):**  So, he was talking about the level of the rate of seeding in the field of the population.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:36):**  So, that was my first practical example of agronomic answer coming from a plant.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:43):**  As you brought up, there is two kind of answer we can receive, agronomic answer and  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:50):**  relationship answer, if I can say that. If I start with the agronomic, I got a case,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:41:57):**  I think it was the first summer, the second years, I start with a grower in about 400-acre vegetable  
**[0:42:06-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:06):**  farms in mock soil, lettuce, onion, carrot, some mini crop. He had a disease of corrupt.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:16):**  There was still another agronomist doing the IPM management, you know, reduced pesticide.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:21):**  It was the same organism that I was working before and he had me to bring different view on the farms.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:29):**  So, he called me, Pascal, my advisor come in the field, they observed there was a root disease in  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:39):**  my carrot, most of my field is attacked and he recommended me to destroy it and never plant  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:47):**  carrots for three, four, five years to make a rotation and he said, probably the disease is  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:42:52):**  going to stay there but we just try to decrease the level. I know you look at things differently  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:00):**  and I would like you come in the field and give me your opinion. So, I went there, it was one of  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:06):**  my first big challenge. So, I was a bit nervous, you know, it's not because I learned the technique,  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:13):**  I practiced the technique that I'm always full of confidence and wow, I'm hot, you know.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:21):**  I'm human as grower and advisor, yes, I doubt something but what I learned over the time is,  
**[0:43:29-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:29):**  and that's a shift if I can open that, in my first 10 year, first years of advisor,  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:36):**  I brought the obligation to myself to bring answer.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:43):**  There was a smooth transition to where now I bring light on the situation, I bring question  
**[0:43:52-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:43:52):**  and when I do that, I realize that we find better information, we have better diagnostic  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:02):**  and we build something, we build an expertise as grower, as advisor, we really build something  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:09):**  on a short, mid and long term in that way. So, I catch myself, I told myself, okay,  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:15):**  forget about your doubt, just walk in the field and do the technique with no expectation,  
**[0:44:23-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:23):**  no obligation to perform, just connect and look what you got, what do you get.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:32):**  At the moment I told that in my mind, I start having problem to breathe,  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:38):**  really important problem to breathe. So, I, wow, I become more emotional, what's going on?  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:45):**  At the moment I ask what's going on, I receive something telling in my mind,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:51):**  a thought telling it is not you, it is the soil and now I start smiling, oh wow, okay, I got it.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:44:59):**  And now it was a dance, I was dancing with the answer, the rational agronomist with the  
**[0:45:08-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:08):**  intuitive part of me. I asked myself, okay, problem of breathing, root disease, oh, maybe there is a  
**[0:45:17-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:17):**  lack of oxygen in the soil, I go take my shovel, dig a hole and it was mock soil and what I see  
**[0:45:26-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:26):**  is the first, maybe, I don't know exactly, 20 centimeter was well decomposed, is that it?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:34):**  Is that a good word in English? Well aerated? No, but the process of decomposition.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:40):**  Okay, yeah. So, because it was a mock soil, so usually there is a lot of fiber,  
**[0:45:44-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:44):**  right, but with time, with microorganism, it starts to decompose and smaller fibers  
**[0:45:53-0:46:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:45:53):**  and it releases the nutrients from the process of decomposition. So, I saw a first part very well  
**[0:46:03-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:03):**  decomposed and right after, there is no decomposition on that part. So it's really  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:11):**  orange, big thick fiber where water has problem to go through, clearly a lack of oxygen.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:19):**  And I see that because I dig other hole, every area where there is more disease, the depth of the  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:28):**  decomposition is higher. So when there is deeper decomposition, the roots went better,  
**[0:46:35-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:35):**  better health system, better area and there is less disease. So, wow, that's really interesting.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:45):**  We walked that field many times, but we never dig a hole and that's a thing I see so much.  
**[0:46:51-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:46:51):**  And honestly, I studied four years at university, but never someone put to the end phases of  
**[0:47:01-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:01):**  look the roots, go dig hole and hole and hole and get information. And many of my growers,  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:09):**  when I went with them dig hole, it was the first time of their life doing it. I'm not saying it's  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:16):**  everybody. I'm clear some of you listening and you did it. But with my experience, I would say that  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:24):**  80 to 90 percent of my growers, and really I'm working with really top grower producing very  
**[0:47:31-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:31):**  good crop, but most of them never took time to dig all to look at the roots of their crop.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:39):**  Yeah, we see the same thing. It's very common. Growers are very busy and they've never been  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:46):**  taught to look at root systems and they're easy to ignore. They're out of sight and out of mind.  
**[0:47:51-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:47:51):**  So if I go back to the technique, I connect in the field because I receive a physical experience.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:04):**  Because for me, it's dependent on the person. When you communicate with nature, you can receive  
**[0:48:10-0:48:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:10):**  information as a thought, as an image, as an emotion. You can be a person. You can be a person.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:19):**  You can be pulled to go somewhere in the field. So it's dependent on the person. Sometimes some  
**[0:48:26-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:26):**  people hear a voice. Me, I never hear a voice. It seems it's not my kind of sensibility. But  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:35):**  you know, be open-minded in the way it's going to be your way. So anyway, if I go back, I go in the  
**[0:48:41-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:41):**  field, I have a breeding problem. It brings me back to my analysis about the link with root disease  
**[0:48:49-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:49):**  and plant. I got the feeling I need to dig a hole. After that, I got information about it's not the  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:48:57):**  same in everybody. You know, the other advisors said that, but no, there is a different place. So  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:03):**  I've got intuition to go in different places in the field, dig out a hole, got other information.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:08):**  What we got the first recommendation that you can do nothing. I have to feel, okay,  
**[0:49:15-0:49:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:15):**  can we do something? I got some information. Yeah, you can put that product to bring more  
**[0:49:21-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:21):**  vitality in the microorganism in the field. You can plant some area, not the other. Anyway,  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:27):**  I got some information I got to make to give to the grower and to understand more what happened  
**[0:49:34-0:49:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:34):**  and what we can do and not do. So that was mostly for the agronomic part. Second part, human part,  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:44):**  relationship human with the nature. I was ready to leave the field because it was an area of the  
**[0:49:52-0:50:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:49:52):**  farms outside of the main block. So it was maybe two kilometers. So I go in my car. At the moment,  
**[0:50:00-0:50:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:00):**  so I go in my car. At the moment I go out of the field, I feel I need to pull out on the side and  
**[0:50:07-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:07):**  to wait. So I stopped my car and I got, I missed to see my grower. I missed the presence of my  
**[0:50:16-0:50:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:16):**  grower. And again, I start smiling and go, what? And I got nothing else. So I go to see my grower  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:28):**  and I shared what I just shared to you about the soil, what I got, the way I got information,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:34):**  I dig all. And so he's really excited. He trusts me and he's really open to develop other skill  
**[0:50:41-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:41):**  to put in his toolbox. So it's very excited. And that's the time that I know I have to talk about  
**[0:50:49-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:50:49):**  the last message. And I ask myself, is that too weird? But what time I know when I have to say  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:00):**  things. And never it happened when I asked strong message for a grower or another person,  
**[0:51:06-0:51:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:06):**  I know it and I know it's going to be accepted. So I told him, I have another message for you.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:17):**  So he starts smiling. Like he was already knowing it was going to be special. I told him,  
**[0:51:24-0:51:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:24):**  do you go often to that field? And now a bit guilty smiling said, no, my main farm is here.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:33):**  And I felt that it was going well. I see visually that it was well, so I don't go often.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:43):**  So I shared that I got that the field, the block, you know, really the soil told me I would like,  
**[0:51:49-0:51:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:49):**  I would enjoy, it's not I would like, I would enjoy that my owner, my grower come to see me  
**[0:51:57-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:51:57):**  more often. And that would help me to grow more healthier plant.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:04):**  For me, it was so beautiful to really realize that the soil or the plant,  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:13):**  they have a relationship with us. And with developing that skill to communicating,  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:20):**  we really can create a partnership, you know, being aware there is a partnership, but doing it  
**[0:52:27-0:52:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:27):**  in a way that we are aware of it, and that it's possible. And for my grower, he really understood  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:34):**  what I meant when I said that. We were talking about, you know, going to spring and feel there  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:40):**  is something going on or going to feel, oh, something good or there is a problem without  
**[0:52:45-0:52:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:45):**  knowing what is the problem. When I told him, it touched something in him that, yeah, I knew  
**[0:52:53-0:53:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:52:53):**  it. I knew it. I had to go more often. But you know, things going fast. And I was not listening  
**[0:53:03-0:53:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:03):**  to that inner voice to go more there. So I commit to myself and to my land. I'm gonna go there.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:13):**  And not because I'm in an application, because I'm excited to really go there and spend more time  
**[0:53:20-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:20):**  there. So, again, long answer to small question. With that technique, we get, we can get agronomic  
**[0:53:29-0:53:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:29):**  information. But there is so much more to explore about developing a relationship with the crop  
**[0:53:39-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:39):**  or the soil for the result in the field. But also, we know one time we asked the question,  
**[0:53:47-0:53:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:47):**  what's your purpose to the plant? It was a general question to all the species. What's your purpose?  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:53:53):**  And the answer was clear. It was our main purpose as a plant is to participate to evolution of human  
**[0:54:00-0:54:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:00):**  being. I really try to keep that in mind that the plant, the soil, they want to be involved in our  
**[0:54:11-0:54:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:11):**  life. They want to take care of ourselves. And I experienced seeing the years after as we developed  
**[0:54:20-0:54:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:20):**  that the more you develop your partnership with the farms, it's like magic. It's like things flow  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:28):**  much more naturally.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:29):**  Something that I've observed over the years, and this is this is more commonly and perhaps better  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:37):**  understood or more relatable perhaps by growers and farmers who are working with livestock. I grew  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:44):**  up in a community with a lot of smaller dairy farms, 40 cows to 100 cow dairies. And on some of  
**[0:54:49-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:49):**  these old dairy farms, where there's tie stalls, there can be two rows of cows with their backs  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:54:58):**  turned to the farmer. The farmer gets up in the morning, goes out and walks to the barn. As the  
**[0:55:03-0:55:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:03):**  cows are getting up, and he will stop and say, there's something wrong with that cow. And yet  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:11):**  there is nothing. There is no visual symptom or no visual expression that something is not okay.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:17):**  It's just an intuitive connection that they develop this relationship and this connection  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:23):**  with their livestock and with their animals that they know something is not right. And I've  
**[0:55:28-0:55:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:28):**  observed this same characteristic with really good growers and sometimes very large growers. They  
**[0:55:36-0:55:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:36):**  spend time out in the fields, walking through the fields, and they know when something isn't right.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:41):**  And so the question or the comment that you just made really kind of struck me pretty hard,  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:46):**  because I was about to ask the question, what is the role of the relationship between the  
**[0:55:52-0:56:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:55:52):**  grower and the plant? What is it that plants desire from the grower?  
**[0:56:00-0:56:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:00):**  I would say that you should ask. Yeah, I would say in general, plants are not different than  
**[0:56:08-0:56:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:08):**  human beings. They won't have a partnership relationship. They want to take care of them,  
**[0:56:16-0:56:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:16):**  and they want to take care of us, guiding us in our decision in life, participating on the success  
**[0:56:28-0:56:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:28):**  of the farms in every aspect from fulfillment, profitability, healthy, and abundance in crop.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:39):**  What I could add is I realized that really plant as a human want to have a purpose.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:51):**  And it's not automatic. It's what I observed. I was surprised that, but I saw it many times.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:56:59):**  If I do the correlation with human being, you know, sometimes we feel a bit lost and we have  
**[0:57:06-0:57:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:06):**  a lack in the sense of what am I doing? What's my purpose? You know, what am I useful for?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:14):**  So there is a different level of where you can be. You can completely out of your purpose.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:24):**  You can be right on and, you know, no doubt about what you want to bring to society and you are  
**[0:57:30-0:57:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:30):**  fulfilled and you can be in between. With the plant, sometime I found a field. Honestly, the  
**[0:57:42-0:57:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:42):**  feeling, it was, the field was depressed. The emotion was there, the field and every single  
**[0:57:50-0:58:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:57:50):**  plant was depressed. Growing, but it's funny, you say that in English, but in a vegetative way, you  
**[0:58:00-0:58:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:00):**  know, for us in French, it means that it's automatic pilot with no awareness. I realized now  
**[0:58:10-0:58:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:10):**  that we judge the nature when we say that. But anyway, the point is when you, when a grower,  
**[0:58:19-0:58:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:19):**  when a team work in the field, you bring your color. If you're joyful, you seed, you bring the  
**[0:58:30-0:58:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:30):**  energy of joy in the field. If you're depressed, if you're stressed, if you're frustrated, you bring  
**[0:58:38-0:58:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:38):**  that energy in the field too. And slowly the soil or the plant get impregnated. Can we say that?  
**[0:58:49-0:58:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:49):**  Wow, my English is very good. I think that's the first time I use that word. That's cool.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:58:56):**  Anyway, so about the purpose. When I observed that, I realized, example, I have a case in mind.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:10):**  I arrive in a field, the field is like dead. Visually, it's okay. It's not a nice field.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:17):**  It's not a very nice field, but it's okay. But I feel like it is dead. So I just do my little  
**[0:59:25-0:59:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:25):**  usual step, breathe, put my reary beside, bring my intention to connect and I listen.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:34):**  And I start noticing some, it's like the field wake up from a night of many days. It's come,  
**[0:59:46-0:59:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:46):**  okay, who's talking? What's going on? And as I said, now, and sometime when I go in the field,  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:52):**  I introduce myself. Okay, I am the human being. The communication you're receiving,  
**[0:59:58-1:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=0:59:58):**  I am the human being at the end of the field now. And now I really get the intention. I feel  
**[1:00:04-1:00:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:04):**  that they know where I am. I don't know how does it work. Do they see me? I know they don't have  
**[1:00:10-1:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:10):**  eyes. Do they see me? Do they feel me? I don't want to go there, but I'm just saying that  
**[1:00:16-1:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:16):**  I feel that there is a recognition. They know I'm there. And usually that's the first time  
**[1:00:25-1:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:25):**  that a human talk or communicate with them. So there is a naturally an excitement coming up.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:34):**  What's going on? Wow. So we start now communicating in different way. And naturally what's coming is  
**[1:00:44-1:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:44):**  by showing interest to them, it's like they become more joyful, more alive. And often at the end,  
**[1:00:55-1:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:00:55):**  they have so much gratitude for me just being in communication with them. And it's like a reminder,  
**[1:01:04-1:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:04):**  it's like a reminder, oh, I'm here to grow, to feed people. I'm here to grow, to be sell and  
**[1:01:14-1:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:14):**  participate to the prosperity of the farms. So sometime I go deeper and I really create  
**[1:01:21-1:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:21):**  partnership. I participate to make sure they understand how important they are. You know,  
**[1:01:27-1:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:27):**  you're going to feed people and can feed a family, child, parents. By harvest, you, the grower,  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:37):**  are going to receive money. With that money, you're going to pay employee, those employee  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:42):**  are going to take care of their family. With that money, you're going to maybe be able to take more  
**[1:01:48-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:48):**  time for himself, take care of himself, build a good thing, build new machinery to take care of  
**[1:01:54-1:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:01:54):**  the soil. So it's really incredible how they can participate in the success in every way  
**[1:02:02-1:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:02):**  of the farms. A couple of years ago, you described a story for me of a grower who was working with  
**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:11):**  several fields of lettuce who had been damaged by hail and the relationship and the image that he  
**[1:02:16-1:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:16):**  held in his mind for those fields. Can you share that story? Are you talking about, it was a storm  
**[1:02:24-1:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:24):**  iron in 2011, I think, and the field has been damaged a lot, not by eel, I think it was, but  
**[1:02:35-1:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:35):**  big drop of water pushed with the wind. So there was big damage on the leaves and it was a field.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:42):**  He told me, tomorrow I'm going to destroy it because there is too much damage and we need  
**[1:02:46-1:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:46):**  still 10 days to get the size to harvest. So in that field, when we entered, there was so much  
**[1:02:55-1:03:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:02:55):**  sadness, we could feel it. That was my first teaching for that specific grower. And I was  
**[1:03:01-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:01):**  just sharing step by step what I was getting as an information. For me, it was new too. So it could  
**[1:03:08-1:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:08):**  feel that, wow, what are we doing with that? And it's funny because it was very vulnerable.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:18):**  Usually I'm not able to deal with sadness in my own life. So what do we do? And what come in my  
**[1:03:27-1:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:27):**  mind is just connect and take care. You have child, if your child is sad or what will you do? You just  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:34):**  listen to him, you hug him. So let's do it in a virtual way, the same with the plants.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:40):**  So it was really interesting. And later in that experience, I was sharing all the different  
**[1:03:47-1:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:47):**  way to experience could have a thought, an image, emotion. And on that specific case, we got pull.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:53):**  It's like something pull our shoulder to look in a different way. And that time you look at me,  
**[1:03:59-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:03:59):**  you got pull. I start smiling and said, yes, I got pull. After that experience with the litters,  
**[1:04:09-1:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:09):**  I started having some image. And that's probably what you remember. I got an image.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:16):**  And I said, do you realize if we start to be able to communicate with plant, create a partnership,  
**[1:04:23-1:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:23):**  create a good context of existence for those plants. I see a head of lettuce in the middle  
**[1:04:31-1:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:31):**  of the table with three child parents and the lettuce is going to feed the plants, the plants,  
**[1:04:38-1:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:38):**  build the human. And now I realize seeing it, wow, it's going to be digested and become blood.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:44):**  So the lettuce become now part of the human system. And we were looking at each other is,  
**[1:04:53-1:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:04:53):**  wow, it is just incredible. And at the same time that we share that, we turn the head on the  
**[1:05:01-1:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:01):**  direction of the first field, the one who was too much damaging was supposed to be destroyed  
**[1:05:07-1:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:07):**  the day after. We look at the field, we look at each other. We look at the field,  
**[1:05:13-1:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:13):**  we look at the field, we look at each other. And at the same time, we say, it's greener.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:21):**  It's greener. And he said, that's impossible. And as I told you, I'm pretty open minded.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:28):**  I know I heard and I experienced so many things in my life. I accept the fact, okay, I'm not crazy.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:36):**  It's clearly greener. And I have the question, okay, what happened? And what I got coming,  
**[1:05:44-1:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:44):**  sir, was a course I've done in university. In my course of agronomy, there was animal physiology  
**[1:05:55-1:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:05:55):**  and we were talking about the eyes, how the eyes perceive the light and the color. And it's only a  
**[1:06:02-1:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:02):**  question of frequency. I explained it the best way I can, but red, if you compare to blue, it is just  
**[1:06:10-1:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:10):**  a different frequency of energy. And in your eyes, there is some specific part that can perceive  
**[1:06:19-1:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:19):**  those frequency and transfer the signal to the brain. So with that reception of different  
**[1:06:28-1:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:28):**  frequency, we know what we call blue, we call yellow or red. Anyway, the more you have energy  
**[1:06:35-1:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:35):**  in yourself, the more your frequency gets higher. It's well documented by many researchers. So  
**[1:06:43-1:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:43):**  more energy, more frequency. My explanation that got validated by nature was, as I was talking  
**[1:06:54-1:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:06:54):**  about with my grower about what was possible, you know, imagine the letters that the field beside  
**[1:07:02-1:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:02):**  was listening. So without knowing, I was creating live a new context of existence for that field of  
**[1:07:12-1:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:12):**  letters. As the letters individually hear that, they get excited. Their level of energy as, you  
**[1:07:22-1:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:22):**  know, if you compare a human being depressed and fully joyful, you know which person has the more  
**[1:07:30-1:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:30):**  energy. That's the joyful person. So what I realized that by talking, I created a new context  
**[1:07:40-1:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:40):**  of existence for those letters. Their level of energy went up. So my eyes, in the eyes of my  
**[1:07:48-1:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:48):**  grower, perceive a different frequency, still green, but a higher level of frequency of green.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:07:56):**  So we perceive it greener, darker greener. So I'm sure if I would have do a leaf analysis,  
**[1:08:05-1:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:05):**  I would not have found more nitrogen or more iron. I know it. But my eyes was able to perceive  
**[1:08:16-1:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:16):**  a change, a difference. And what's cool with that, that field, my grower told me was supposed  
**[1:08:24-1:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:24):**  to destroy it the day after. I talked with him two weeks later, or he texted me and he told me,  
**[1:08:33-1:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:33):**  we finally harvest the field. I decided to keep it. I give some natural spray, but I know  
**[1:08:43-1:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:43):**  it's not that. I really know that that day that we went, something happened. And honestly,  
**[1:08:51-1:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:08:51):**  I forget the point, very important. When I got the explanation of why my eyes were perceiving  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:00):**  a greener color, I told myself, I'm going to ask the field. And at the moment I asked the  
**[1:09:04-1:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:04):**  question, the field, the letters told me, sorry, we cannot answer now because we have not so much  
**[1:09:12-1:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:12):**  time to be ready for the harvest in 10 days. So it's like, okay, we got to heal. We're going to  
**[1:09:20-1:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:20):**  be ready so that the grower can harvest us. Any harvest, almost all the field, it was almost  
**[1:09:28-1:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:28):**  100%. Clearly there was some leaf on the bottom that would damage. And the market was really low  
**[1:09:39-1:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:39):**  because many other growers had problems, but it was still able to harvest a quality of lettuce  
**[1:09:48-1:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:48):**  to sell it. And I'm clear that it started with the new context we created, me and my grower,  
**[1:09:55-1:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:09:55):**  and that the letters hear us. Wow. Wow. So you've described a number of different experiences in  
**[1:10:04-1:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:04):**  communicating with crops. And I think something that I've learned over the years is how in the  
**[1:10:08-1:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:08):**  past, how important it is for growers to have a clear image of success and what success looks  
**[1:10:16-1:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:16):**  like for them in the context, just as you described of not success in terms of money and  
**[1:10:23-1:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:23):**  boxes of produce in a cooler, but success in growing a crop to really support and sustain  
**[1:10:32-1:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:32):**  people. And I've observed that the growers who have a clear image of their crops sustaining humans  
**[1:10:39-1:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:39):**  tend to have very strong successes in the field very consistently. So all of these pieces, and I  
**[1:10:46-1:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:46):**  think all the experiences that you must have had, Pascal, I'm sure have given you a very  
**[1:10:51-1:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:51):**  interesting perspective on agriculture and on food production. So a question that I have for you  
**[1:10:56-1:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:10:56):**  around that is, what is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture that is  
**[1:11:04-1:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:04):**  different from the mainstream view, from what most people believe?  
**[1:11:10-1:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:10):**  I think we put too much emphasis on the exterior versus what's inside. Second thing, I think  
**[1:11:21-1:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:21):**  we need, not we need, but there is an opportunity to work with the nature instead of fighting it.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:29):**  And I'm clearly, I'm not judging, I'm just bringing some observation and some facts.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:34):**  You know, I've been working with conventional, if we call it conventional, and with organic grower.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:40):**  I've saw good organic, bad organic, good conventional, bad conventional, I mean,  
**[1:11:46-1:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:46):**  in a way to the result in the field. But sometimes I saw organic grower fighting nature.  
**[1:11:56-1:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:11:56):**  They fight nature with natural product, but they fight nature. And I saw conventional grower using,  
**[1:12:05-1:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:05):**  you know, chemical fertilizer, but with love, with really trying to understand the nutrition  
**[1:12:13-1:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:13):**  of the plant, really caring, observing with really beautiful results. And I'm not saying that one is  
**[1:12:22-1:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:22):**  better, that using chemical fertilizer is good or what. What I'm just saying is, in what context are  
**[1:12:32-1:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:32):**  we doing the things? Are we embracing nature? Because, you know, if we are a grower, if you're  
**[1:12:39-1:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:39):**  a grower, if you're a crop advisor, most of them, most of us, most of you, you do it because you like  
**[1:12:48-1:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:48):**  grow food, you like grow plants. Can be animals too. Some doing for business, you know,  
**[1:12:56-1:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:12:56):**  agriculture is like a small society, you know, there is no different. There is an entrepreneur  
**[1:13:01-1:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:01):**  with integrity and who love what they do, and there is some people who did just for the money.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:06):**  So in general, I think we fight too much the nature instead of working and creating a partnership.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:14):**  And the opportunity to develop your awareness and your communication is just that. It's just  
**[1:13:20-1:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:20):**  a tool to fit with what I think agriculture should go. Going in a way that we build something,  
**[1:13:29-1:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:29):**  we are proud of what we do, we bring love, passion, and that's it. And I think doing that,  
**[1:13:39-1:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:39):**  the agriculture can just be positive. And, you know, I was giving the example of the storm  
**[1:13:46-1:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:46):**  with my grower. Sometimes nature, I think, remind us that, whoa, take it easy, you're not going the  
**[1:13:54-1:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:13:54):**  right way. So it's not cool or comfortable at the moment, but that doesn't mean it's not that it's  
**[1:14:03-1:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:03):**  supposed to happen for our own development or the development of the farm or the enterprise  
**[1:14:08-1:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:08):**  or the agriculture. That is intriguing. Within the context of all the pieces that we've talked  
**[1:14:14-1:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:14):**  about, Pascal, what is a book or resource that you would recommend most often? I don't have one  
**[1:14:21-1:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:21):**  specific. I would say if that interests you, look at the sign. In the next days, in the next week,  
**[1:14:32-1:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:32):**  someone's going to call you or someone's going to talk about a specific book, a new technique.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:38):**  Life is going to show you the way. Clearly, on the telepathic communication, Maya Kincaid in  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:47):**  Soudana was someone who made a tremendous difference in my life. I am in a process also  
**[1:14:53-1:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:14:53):**  to develop my workshop and really spread that approach or that way of seeing life.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:01):**  But I would say another thing that I love too, it's an energetic technique. It's called  
**[1:15:07-1:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:07):**  Pranic healing, healing with the prana. It's an international course in about 100 countries  
**[1:15:16-1:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:16):**  in the world. It's a way also to develop spirituality, but it teaches on any kind of  
**[1:15:23-1:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:23):**  religion or people without religion because the founder of this technique was a chemical engineer.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:34):**  He developed this technique of understanding energy in a very practical and grounded way.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:41):**  I know that the level one of that course, Pranic healing, has made a huge impact in my  
**[1:15:48-1:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:48):**  understanding of my system, being part of that system, explaining it as a fact. After, you can  
**[1:15:57-1:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:15:57):**  just expand and add your own understanding and skill to improve it. That's some example I have  
**[1:16:04-1:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:04):**  in mind. I would say trust, have faith that the path is going to show, if you ask it, at a good time,  
**[1:16:11-1:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:11):**  but in the right way. I would add to that, I think there are two books very relevant to actually what  
**[1:16:19-1:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:19):**  we're speaking about, which were very influential for me. One of them is titled The Lost Language of  
**[1:16:26-1:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:26):**  Plants, and the second one is titled The Secret Teachings of Plants, both by Stephen Herrad Bühner.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:34):**  Both of those are very good at describing the relationship aspect of the relationship that  
**[1:16:42-1:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:42):**  plants desire and that we can have, and provide a very interesting perspective. Pascal, we've talked  
**[1:16:48-1:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:48):**  about many different and very exciting topics. What is a question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[1:16:53-1:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:16:53):**  What do you eat for dinner?  
**[1:17:00-1:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:00):**  I don't know. I really, I am nothing specific. I really love the way you lead the interview.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:11):**  For me, it was really an opportunity to just share my experiences. You know I really appreciate who  
**[1:17:19-1:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:19):**  you are as a person, as a consultant. I think you set up the table, the place with all your  
**[1:17:28-1:17:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:28):**  questions that agriculture, it's not only about harvesting something, it's about living off some  
**[1:17:39-1:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:39):**  of a work that can be just wonderful, and then with opportunity to evolve and to connect with  
**[1:17:46-1:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:46):**  something beautiful that is called life. I have no specific question more than what you brought today.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:17:57):**  Wonderful. Pascal, thank you very much for joining us, and thank you for sharing your stories  
**[1:18:03-1:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:03):**  and your examples. I'm very inspired, and I'm sure many other people will be as well.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:07):**  Thank you very much. That's very kind. The team at AEA and I are dedicated to bringing this show to  
**[1:18:13-1:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:13):**  you because we believe that knowledge and information is the foundation of successful  
**[1:18:18-1:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:18):**  regenerative systems. At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food and making more money  
**[1:18:25-1:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:25):**  from your crops is possible, and since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers to help  
**[1:18:30-1:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:30):**  them do just that. At AEA, we don't guess. We measure. We test. We analyze, and we provide  
**[1:18:37-1:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:37):**  recommendations based on scientific data and knowledge and experience. We've developed products

**[1:18:48-1:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:48):**  If you are a professional grower who believes in testing instead of guessing, someone who believes  
**[1:18:54-1:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-conversation-with-plants-pascal-fafard/#t=1:18:54):**  in a better, more regenerative way to grow, visit advancingecoag.com and contact us to see if AEA is

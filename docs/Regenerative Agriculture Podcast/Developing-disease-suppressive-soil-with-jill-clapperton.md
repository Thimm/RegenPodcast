### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 31 Mar 2020 20:23:07)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. Today I'm  
**[0:00:04-0:00:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:04):**  delighted to have with me Jill Clapperton who I'm certain many of you have heard of and if you have  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:10):**  not then you're really missing out and you're going to enjoy this conversation. Jill has done  
**[0:00:15-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:15):**  a lot of fascinating work over the years in the plains in Canada on developing disease  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:22):**  suppressive soils and microbial populations and a broad range of fascinating topics. Jill,  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:28):**  I don't want to diminish the broad array of work that you have done. I think it would be best for  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:33):**  you to share a little bit about your pathway and the scope of the work that you've done  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:38):**  in agriculture and agronomy over the last few decades. Okay, yeah we can do that. I started,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:45):**  I actually, I have a PhD in plant ecophysiology so I'm actually more of a plant physiologist than  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:52):**  anything else with a fascination with the rhizosphere. So although it was plant  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:59):**  ecophysiology I studied the effects of air pollution, sulfur dioxide air pollution,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:05):**  on plant photosynthesis and then how that affected mycorrhizal fungi and then how that affected the  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:12):**  biochemistry of the rhizosphere. And I was very lucky early on to be mentored by Dr. Dennis  
**[0:01:19-0:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:19):**  Parkinson who was a renowned soil ecologist and then later on by Glyn Bowen and Albert Rivera  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:28):**  from Australia. Well Albert Rivera in the 50s published the first papers on rhizosphere ecology  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:34):**  so I've been very fortunate in my career to be mentored by really brilliant scientists in their  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:42):**  field. And then you know I sort of went on from that after I graduated with my PhD I went on to  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:48):**  work for agriculture in Agri-Food Canada as the rhizosphere ecologist. So rhizosphere ecologist  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:55):**  means that I was studying the interactions between plants, soil organisms and soils  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:02):**  and not just microorganisms. And there I was very fortunate to meet Dr. Valerie Bien-Peltier  
**[0:02:09-0:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:09):**  who is a renowned acrologist so she studies mites, soil mites and I started to become very aware  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:19):**  that the soil fauna were just as important as all the microbes that we were studying  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:26):**  and eventually I started to work on earthworms and I founded the worm watch program and also  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:33):**  had the methodology developed through the worm watch program accepted by the FAO for ecological  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:39):**  monitoring. So what it really came down to is we started to really understand that the plant,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:46):**  well we've I guess we've always understood that the plant really drives everything that happens  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:51):**  in the rhizosphere. So the rhizosphere being the root, the soil attached to the root and then the  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:57):**  soil that's influenced by the roots. When we do that you can really see that your most biologically  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:04):**  active area in your soil is in and around the roots. So if you think about a crop then it's  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:10):**  in the crop row. It's not in the bulk soil it'll be in the crop row. And then once we're in the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:14):**  crop row we also start to understand that every different plant species that you grow in within  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:22):**  your community or a crop row whether you're growing companions or covers or you know doing  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:28):**  multi-cropping, multi-species cropping, then each one of those plant species that are there  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:34):**  exude their own signature of carbon compounds. And when I say that I'm not just talking about sugars,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:41):**  I'm talking about amino acids and lipids and nucleic acids and anything that the plant makes  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:47):**  and when the plant makes things they always have carbon backbone or carbon skeleton. So let's call  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:54):**  them carbon skeletons. And then when we start putting meat on the bones and we start adding  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:59):**  you know mineral nutrients and oxygens and hydroxyl groups like OH groups and things like  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:06):**  that that make these very long or very short carbon chains, skeletons functional so that they  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:14):**  have this ability to do things within the rhizome here. And some of them will actually call to  
**[0:04:21-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:21):**  action, like so examples for nematodes that can parasitize insect larvae that are feeding on the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:29):**  roots of a plant. Or they'll call to action the rhizobium because they have a legume and it wants  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:35):**  to fix nitrogen. So it's not just about sugars and a lot of people focus on sugars but it's not just  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:41):**  about sugars. And there's this whole interaction that happens in the rhizosphere which is all about  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:48):**  predator-prey reactions. So soil fauna acting as the predators and not just them but also the  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:56):**  nematodes and the protozoa which we also predators feeding on the bacteria and the fungi. Now this is  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:03):**  really really important because if we just had microbes in around the roots of plants, the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:11):**  microbes would out-compete the plant for the nutrients that we put down with our crops because  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:16):**  they're very good at growing new generations in less than 24 hours. And so they use it all up and  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:23):**  so a lot of people will say okay well microbes just need sugar. Well actually they don't. They  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:28):**  need a carbon source which would be like the exodutes from the plants but actually they need  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:34):**  amino acids and they need lipids and they need all the things that the plant produces but they also  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:40):**  need iron and manganese and boron and calcium and all these other mineral elements the same as the  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:48):**  plant does in order for them to grow their skeleton. Grow you know a skeleton and then grow  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:54):**  the meat onto the bones. For example if we are looking at things that are beneficial rhizosphere  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:59):**  organisms, the things that promote plant growth like a lot of the Pseudomonas bacteria, they need  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:05):**  a lot of iron. They produce a fluorescent compound that requires them to have iron so they will  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:12):**  actually use the iron in and around the roots which means that the plant actually has to compete  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:17):**  with the microbes for that iron. So if you think about it now if we go to the next step then if we  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:24):**  have these predators coming in and eating them and then pooping out the minerals and that the other  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:30):**  form of carbon then we actually the plant can have access to it. So the predators are really  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:37):**  important in the nutrient cycling. In fact they're more important than anything else because somebody  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:42):**  needs to recycle all the bacteria and the fungi that are hoarding a lot of the nutrients from the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:48):**  plant. So I started working on that and then I started to understand this whole idea of signatures  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:55):**  and how all these different plants like plants that I would grow between the rows or the cover  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:00):**  crop that I would grow as a fallow replacement would affect the nutrient density in the subsequent  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:06):**  crop and then it was like well that's really interesting. If I put separate like keep the  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:11):**  plants as monocultures of the cover then I have a different nutrient density in the wheat but if I  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:17):**  mix these plants they have another different nutrient density so how does that work? And  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:23):**  it became really obvious that plants exude root exudates that allow them to have access to mineral  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:30):**  nutrients that they wouldn't get if they didn't exude like acids or bases or calcium or things  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:38):**  like that so that they could bind up the things they need and then bring them in through the plant  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:43):**  root and then shuttle them up to the shoot. And microbes are very much involved in that process  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:50):**  as well. So the rhizosphere is really this factory if you want to call it this very big  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:57):**  city around the roots that has all these multiple functions that is driving your plant health. But  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:04):**  it's also driving soil health because the mycorrhiza when plants are colonized by mycorrhiza  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:13):**  the mycorrhiza actually changed the whole physiology of the root including photosynthesis.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:18):**  So they will actually stimulate photosynthesis and then they stimulate the movement of amino acids  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:24):**  and organic acids over sugars to the root in order to bathe the whole rhizosphere in a substrate that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:33):**  attracts plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and excludes a lot of your pathogens because  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:40):**  yes the roots can actually do that too. They can actually make the root environment or the rhizosphere  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:45):**  so it excludes plant pathogens or they can make it because we haven't given them enough nutrition  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:51):**  they can't produce those compounds or they can't defend themselves and so then we  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:55):**  offer openings to some of these pathogens. So I started to really as I was a scientist with  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:02):**  Ag Canada I started to really understand how earthworms were affected by agricultural practices,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:09):**  how crop rotation were so important for disease and then we started to play with cover crops and  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:16):**  companion crops and multi-species cropping and really understand how when things grow together  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:22):**  sometimes they actually grow better than they do by themselves. Eventually that led me to working  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:28):**  on my own and moving to the United States with my family and starting my own company Rise of Terra  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:35):**  so that I could explore more of the things that I was really interested in and also to work less  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:41):**  in academia but more with farmers because I also realized that in a lot of cases I was actually  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:47):**  hampered as a research scientist. I was always pushing back against boundaries and pushing  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:53):**  back against ideas that people thought were a lot of my colleagues thought were kind of crazy but  
**[0:09:59-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:59):**  farmers were already implementing very successfully. So it was about being able to work on concepts  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:07):**  that were at least 20 years in the future so for me that was always my goal was to always look  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:13):**  forward you know 15 or 20 years and think about where farmers should be or where farmers thought  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:19):**  they should be and then actually work towards an understanding so that by the time all the growers  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:26):**  got to that place we would know a lot more about it and they'd be able to implement things  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:32):**  immediately or perhaps even before that and certainly some of the innovative growers in  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:37):**  the world have already sort of surpassed a 15-year window and started doing things you know within 10  
**[0:10:43-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:43):**  years of us knowing some of these things. So I was doing a lot of work with Dr. Ross Welch from ARS  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:52):**  at Cornell. He was very helpful in steering me well into nutrient density and the understanding  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:01):**  of what nutrient dense food was and how to look at the minerals in food and what that meant and  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:08):**  I'd already seen changes when we had different crop rotations and different cover crops and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:13):**  different companions but wasn't really fully understanding of it and was thinking strongly  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:20):**  about staying in academia to work on this and he was the one who really encouraged me to step out  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:27):**  and start working on nutrient density as part of my consulting business and that was  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:36):**  a little over 10 years ago almost 15 years ago and now we're really starting to understand  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:43):**  more about nutrient density. We have tools that will measure it fairly easily and I've been very  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:48):**  lucky to work with Dr. Bruce Kaiser on that and the tracer and XRF to understand how we can  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:56):**  measure nutrient density in food grains and various other samples very quickly like 30  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:01):**  seconds quickly. You know that's led me to the Real Food Campaign and and Ben 7 and a lot of  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:08):**  other really great people who are really interested in food quality and how do we  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:14):**  create more nutrient dense food including Chef Dan Barber. Jill that is an excellent  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:22):**  outstanding overview and invites about three dozen follow-up questions that come to mind. I  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:31):**  scarcely know where to begin but perhaps one thought that comes to mind you mentioned  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:37):**  the need to have protozoa and soil fauna to grade on the soil microbial populations.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:44):**  A phenomena that we have observed a number of times with vegetable growers who've chosen to  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:48):**  constantly spoon feed sugars through their irrigation systems during the growing season  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:52):**  and some soil types we've observed significant nutrient deficiencies with this practice. It's  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:58):**  very easy to produce a calcium deficiency even on calcareous soils for example  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:03):**  by constantly spoon feeding sugar. So in in this type of ecosystem what would be an appropriate  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:10):**  management response? Obviously you discontinue constantly spoon feeding the sugar that's step  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:15):**  one but then from a microbial management perspective what are the practices that could  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:20):**  be used to shift the microbial population and to release some of those tied up nutrients?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:25):**  First off yeah so one thing I'll say about that is that when you feed sugars you can  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:32):**  feed sugars you feed the weedy bacteria in your soil and when I say weedy ones I mean the ones  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:39):**  that can grow really quickly on available nutrients which is the same practice as weeds  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:45):**  like weeds in the fields are really good at growing any kind of available nutrient they can  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:49):**  just you know germinate and grow like crazy. Well these bacteria are exactly the same you give them  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:55):**  free sugars and they grow like crazy a bit like giving your kids candy and then watching them zoom  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:02):**  so they their populations grow very quickly and that means that a lot of so the other thing that's  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:09):**  happening there is that the function of your rhizosphere has changed because these things  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:16):**  being like weeds are just growing really quickly and using up every mineral nutrient that they can  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:22):**  find if we don't have really good and even the predators are going to take a while to get up to  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:27):**  speed because you are really like putting the bacteria on red bull and getting them to go really  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:33):**  fast and metabolize really quickly and grow big populations that are overwhelming everything else.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:39):**  So this is a case of now we need to think about this as stopping that but now we need to get the  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:46):**  mineral nutrients and our trace elements into that fertigation so that what we're doing instead  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:52):**  is making sure that the plant gets some trace elements or even macro nutrition especially if  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:59):**  we see an immobilization because that's what you're experiencing at that point is immobilization and  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:04):**  eventually things will grow out of it as long as we have good soil structure and we have the you  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:10):**  know because it's predator-prey relationship so it means the prey has to really increase before the  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:15):**  predator population starts going up with it so we don't have to delay you get a lot of prey and then  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:21):**  you don't get the predator you have a delay until the predators can really get in there and start  
**[0:15:25-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:25):**  working. However if we do things more in a regenerative sustainable way then we maintain  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:33):**  a predator population at the same time so we always have some prey so we've got you know good  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:38):**  soil health we've got bacterium fungi in there but we're feeding them complex substrates that they  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:44):**  have to work for and we're also maintaining that soil ecological function so we have the nitrifiers  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:51):**  working we have the manganese reducers we have the iron reduced we have all these different  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:56):**  bacteria groups working their best and those in that sort of what we're gearing for so what we  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:02):**  need to do if we start to see mineral nutrient tie up we need to get the mineral nutrients in  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:09):**  there because the bacteria well we need to stop the sugars we need to get the mineral nutrients in  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:15):**  ideally you put them in in a you know in a humid form so we still have the carbon chains but  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:21):**  they're more complex carbon chains and you'd be even if you had a compost tea you'd be putting  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:29):**  that in in hopes that you'd start to out compete some of the things that you grew up with all the  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:34):**  sugars and you'd certainly be one of the things that i would certainly be doing is i'd be adding  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:41):**  manganese iron and zinc and the reason i'd be doing now is because i'd be looking for  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:46):**  those reducer populations which are all plant growth promoting bacteria so we need to change  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:53):**  the population back to being a functioning population to assist the plant in its quest for  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:59):**  optimum growth over the last six or eight months i've been well for the last several years for that  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:05):**  matter i've been working deeply to try to better understand the functions of redox and reduced  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:12):**  trace mineral availability in the profile and my understanding at this moment i'm seeking  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:16):**  clarification on this my understanding is that as a general rule of thumb the organisms which have  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:23):**  a reducing effect also tends to be disease suppressive and provide nutrition to plants  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:30):**  and whereas those that have an oxidizing effect have the potential to be more pathogenic or  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:36):**  enhance a disease or produce a disease enhancing environment is that a correct understanding it is  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:42):**  and that comes back to a bit of our understanding about our own bodies so the reason that we  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:49):**  want to eat antioxidants right is because we don't want to be in that oxidized state  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:56):**  we actually want to absorb some of the extra oxygen that may be produced from peroxidases  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:01):**  and some other things which are enzymes that can actually cause intracellular damage and cell  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:08):**  damage and they're produced from inflammation and plants get inflammation too by the way just  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:14):**  differently so one of the things we still need some oxidizers because there's there's some  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:21):**  reasons that you know ecologically that we need them because we need everything in there we just  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:26):**  need to function in a way that supports plant growth as opposed to detracting from plant growth  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:32):**  and the one thing we don't need is we don't need plant membranes being split apart or we don't need  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:38):**  leaky cell walls or things like that that allow pathogens to get in and the one thing that we need  
**[0:18:44-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:44):**  all the  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:14):**  to understand that was like, well, if we manage the rhizosphere really well and we think about  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:20):**  rhizosphere processes in a different way, then we don't actually need any of this stuff because  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:24):**  we can create these healthy rhizosphere which will keep these plants really strong. And part of that  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:31):**  was my understanding, you know, we need to make sure that we have some of these minerals. We have  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:37):**  enough manganese and we have enough iron and zinc and even to a certain extent selenium in order to  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:44):**  facilitate these reactions. And it's the same in our bodies. We need the same thing in our bodies.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:50):**  We need manganese, we need iron, we need zinc, we need a lot of zinc. Zinc is the gatekeeper for all

**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:04):**  sure that we have enough zinc in our system in order to fight these things if we get them. And so  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:10):**  in many ways, plants and people and animals share a lot of the similar pathways in terms of immune  
**[0:20:17-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:17):**  response and fighting diseases. You mentioned that plants are exuding much more various different  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:26):**  photosynthesis other than sugars, but also amino acids and also lipids and other compounds.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:33):**  I would like to better understand how do plants, what is the profile of the various compounds that  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:39):**  plants produce at different levels of plant health? You've been looking at nutrient density.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:43):**  Has anyone been looking at how lipid profiles or carbohydrate profiles might change in the root  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:49):**  exudates at different levels of plant health and nutritional profiles? A little bit, but not very  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:54):**  much. I mean, there's a number of people like to Grayson who have been studying, you know, root  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:00):**  exudates and looking at root exudates with different changes in plant health. But, you know,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:06):**  we haven't been doing a lot of that with crops. And I think we're at a point now where people are  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:12):**  interested in lower inputs and doing things in a slightly different way. Like, I think that's part  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:17):**  of the regenerative movement. People are interested in plant health and looking at it a different way.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:23):**  So I think we're going to start looking at that a little bit more. But I mean, I know from my own  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:28):**  work that we saw very clearly that when plants are colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, you know,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:35):**  hell, my tracer studies, we saw very clearly that the photosensates were completely changed  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:42):**  and the plant was doing things in a very different way. So it had much higher rates of photosynthesis.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:48):**  The composition of the root exudates was shifted very much towards amino acids and organic acids.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:55):**  So there was a pH shift as well. And then when you start to look at what's living in there in the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:01):**  communities around it, they were really shifted towards plant growth promotion, which you can  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:07):**  understand because if you're a mycorrhiza, you need that host, an endomycorrhiza, you need that  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:12):**  host to be the best host that it can be because you can't grow without the host. You're going to  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:17):**  protect your host at all costs because you have to. I mean, you're relying on it to finish your  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:24):**  own growth cycle. This is a really complicated relationship because you need certain things as  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:30):**  a mycorrhiza. I need certain things in order to grow my hyphae. I need to have slightly more acid  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:36):**  root exudates because I'm going to gather zinc and iron and manganese and phosphorus and all  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:42):**  these other and calcium and all these other minerals, including boron, so that I can transport  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:47):**  them into the plant and trade them for more amino acids and more carboxylic acids and more  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:53):**  organic acids and then just enough sugars to keep me going. I think this is a teachable moment at  
**[0:23:01-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:01):**  this point. What do you think? Yes, the outcome of photosynthesis is glucose, but that molecule  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:11):**  is used in so many different ways. It's sort of like you start with the engine and then you just  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:19):**  keep adding cars onto the train. Well, it's kind of the same thing. You start adding cars onto  
**[0:23:27-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:27):**  the train and building these very different molecules from photosynthesis. The photosensates  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:36):**  are transformed into many different compounds, which are shot to the roots and some of them are  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:40):**  formed in the roots and then sent back up. The plant is actually creating so many different  
**[0:23:46-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:46):**  compounds on a daily, hourly, minute-by-minute basis that it could blow our minds. Even these  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:55):**  secondary plant compounds that are used for disease fighting, if they make a whole bunch  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:00):**  of them and they go, ah, don't really need them, then they break them all down and break them into  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:06):**  other compounds. It's this constant, oh, I don't really need this. I'll make something new out of  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:12):**  that. Or, oh, I really need this because the roots are requiring that right now.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:18):**  The plant is really assessing itself chemically, signaling all the time, going, oh, I've got  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:24):**  something on my leaf. I've got an aphid on my leaf and it's poking a hole in my leaf. Oh my goodness,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:29):**  I need to ramp up secondary production because I need to lignify my leaf. It's sending out all  
**[0:24:35-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:35):**  these signals to do that. The plant is this great big chemical factory that's sensing what's going  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:43):**  on in the roots. I've got Collembola pruning my roots. Okay, that's probably okay. But no,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:49):**  I've got this nematode poking a hole in my root now. Now I have to send all these secondary  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:54):**  metabolites down to the roots because I need to actually lignify the roots so that the nematode  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:59):**  can't go any farther. I think the thing that I really want to convey to people, John, is that  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:03):**  there's a lot of really complicated signaling going on when things start happening. Or even  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:10):**  when they're not happening, there's still a lot of complicated signaling going on within the plant  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:15):**  and a lot of messengers going back and forth between the shoots and the roots to make sure  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:19):**  that plant has optimum nutrition. It's really our jobs as growers, farmers, producers, ranchers,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:26):**  to make sure that the plants have enough of that or live in a community that can provide enough of  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:32):**  that, of whatever they need in order to be at their optimum. The reason I ask that question  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:39):**  is because it's my understanding, we know that each plant has a symbiotic community,  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:45):**  that it has a symbiotic relationship with. Some of these communities, as you mentioned several  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:50):**  times, are very disease-suppressive. And that is my understanding that the communities of some of  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:55):**  our crop plants may not be disease-suppressive, but may be disease-enhancing. What I'm really  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:01):**  trying to understand as I'm connecting some of the dots in the literature or trying to connect some  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:06):**  of the dots, it appears possible, although it hasn't been well studied that I have read it,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:11):**  it appears possible that some plants may have a disease-enhancing associated microbial community.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:20):**  And that can shift to a disease-suppressive microbial community dependent on the degree of  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:25):**  nutritional integrity that the crop has itself. So that's the dots that I'm seeking to connect.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:32):**  I would love to have your insights on that. There are. I mean, there's also parasitic plants,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:38):**  and they use root exudates to change the community around other roots. There are plants that grow in  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:46):**  a community that will take over, for example, like spurge and things like that, that will,  
**[0:26:52-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:52):**  in a range community, which will exude exudates that actually totally mess up the microbial  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:59):**  community of their surrounding plants and then create this inhibition zone around their own  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:04):**  roots so that they can be very competitive for their own resources. So they'll actually  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:11):**  sabotage plants around them and make them more susceptible to disease in order to further their  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:17):**  own competitive advantage. And then there are plants. I mean, we've been playing a lot with  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:24):**  technology, and there are plants that are genetically modified. And I'm speaking of  
**[0:27:30-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:30):**  trans-genetic plants. So plants where we have used agrobacterium cumefaciens to place genetic  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:39):**  codes into other plants and use them from bacteria or insects or things like that. That's a really  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:47):**  interesting concept too, because those plants produce a lot of opines or opines, however you  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:54):**  want to say it. And in doing so, those compounds, as I understand it, are like organ rejection  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:01):**  drugs. And normally, plants wouldn't have those in their rhizosphere. They're kind of peculiar  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:08):**  compounds, and they wouldn't have them sustained. And we really don't understand what the  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:14):**  consequences of that are. I mean, there's been a number of studies that have been released  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:19):**  recently talking about changes, but certainly there were a lot of studies early on about how  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:26):**  community function didn't change. But I mean, everybody knew that there were some changes in  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:31):**  the rhizosphere community. But I have to be honest, in a lot of ways, we didn't really,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:36):**  and I think we still don't understand what that means. Because, I mean, even now with all our  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:42):**  technologies and all the genetic markers and stuff, we still, there are so many things. The  
**[0:28:47-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:47):**  biodiversity in the rhizosphere is so huge, so huge, way bigger than anything you could imagine  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:54):**  in any environment on Earth in a terrestrial environment, above ground environment, I should  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:59):**  say. And we don't even know what half of these things are. They're just sort of like weird  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:03):**  sequences. We know they are from something, but we don't even know what they're from.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:08):**  So we are still trying to understand what these changes are. But I think the most important thing  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:15):**  right now, yes, it's important to understand those changes. The important thing to understand  
**[0:29:21-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:21):**  is that you have healthy soil and you have a really beneficial rhizosphere, you are going to  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:28):**  make your plant the best that it can be, no matter what. I mean, even transgendered plants need good  
**[0:29:34-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:34):**  soil to grow in. And we need to have the soil functioning, which means that we have to really  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:43):**  think about, if we're always just growing one plant community, we also have to think about,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:48):**  well, what was growing there before? Like, did we have a tall grass prairie? Well, that meant  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:52):**  that we had a lot of mycorrhiza, we had a lot of diversity. And if we're just rotating two crops  
**[0:29:59-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:59):**  all the time, we can't expect to have the healthy soils that we had previously. And we can't expect  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:07):**  to have close cycles of nutrients, which most people want, because that's not possible because  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:11):**  we're always exporting off our farms. So we need to think more about the fact that we can use soil  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:18):**  health, certainly, to generate the nutrition in the plants and to keep healthy plants,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:24):**  we can use diversity to mess up the organisms that are in there that are trying to cause disease.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:31):**  Because if they don't have a pure stand of something, it's really hard to find what you're  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:37):**  looking for. And if all the roots are growing fast, they can't jump on because they're terrible  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:43):**  sprinters. They don't move very fast. They don't reproduce very fast. So if our roots grow fast,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:49):**  and our plants are really vigorous, we can outcompete most of those disease organisms  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:53):**  really easily. As long as we maintain our nutrient density in the soil, and maintain the  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:58):**  nutrition that the plants need in order to fight them up, we'll be okay. But yeah, I mean, plants  
**[0:31:05-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:05):**  are always looking for an advantage for space, water, light, oxygen, nutrients, they have to compete  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:13):**  in the ground for those nutrients. So they produce also a lot of really nasty chemicals to inhibit  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:19):**  the neighbors, or to take out the neighbors so that they can have it all for themselves.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:26):**  It's not always a synergistic environment at all. And that's why when we start putting plants  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:32):**  together, like when we're intercropping, we have to think about, well, does this plant actually  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:37):**  like each other? Because there are some plants that actually don't like each other. It's like,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:41):**  I don't like you at all. And I'm going to do my best to inhibit your growth. And watch me do this.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:49):**  There's a growing interest in developing these disease-suppressive soils and cropping blends  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:55):**  that can suppress disease. What are some of the best management tools and practices to develop  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:00):**  that and to accomplish those? It's really interesting. In fact, actually, I think just  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:04):**  on Friday, I was having a discussion about suppressive soils. We have to understand that  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:11):**  the inoculum density of diseases is always in our soils. We always have a large disease in our  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:17):**  soils. Once we have had disease, it's always there. We never get rid of it. So that's the  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:21):**  first thing we need to understand as we go forward in this conversation. The other thing is that we  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:27):**  need to create an environment where plants can grow roots very quickly. And we need to put our  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:32):**  seeds in the ground with optimum temperature. Because not all plant roots like to grow in cooler  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:38):**  temperatures. And some of them don't like to grow in hot temperatures. And nothing really like has  
**[0:32:43-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:43):**  optimum root growth over 75 degrees Fahrenheit. So we need to think about how we're growing things.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:56):**  So we need to stay within that. If you can stay within the 15 degrees Celsius to that 25,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:03):**  30 degrees Celsius window with your cool and cool seasons on the cool side, and your warm seasons  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:10):**  on the warm side, and let that seed germinate very, very quickly, you will create an environment  
**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:16):**  for those plants. The other thing is to really think about, and honestly, there's not a lot of  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:24):**  data on this, but you're gonna have to experiment on your own. So you have to think about things  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:28):**  that you might want to put together. Now there are things that I can tell you do not grow. So don't  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:33):**  try and grow corn and canola together because they don't like each other at all. Not even close. Corn  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:38):**  likes legumes. Give it a legume and it's like, woohoo, we're together. And the mycorrhizas benefit  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:45):**  each other. And the microorganisms both like each other. So it's a good combination. Peas and  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:53):**  canola like each other, but warm seasons and canola don't like each other. And we know that  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:58):**  things like lentils and flax, chickpeas and flax, they like each other too. They like each other a  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:05):**  lot. So some of those are the kinds of things that we can use to our advantage. I can also tell you  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:11):**  that sorghum can be very, cannot like a number of things. And so that's the kind of thing that you  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:17):**  need to figure out. Some of the warm season legumes will grow very well with it. The cool  
**[0:34:22-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:22):**  season legumes will not. They do not like sorghum Sudan very much. If we tried to evaluate some of  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:29):**  these blends and combinations, what are the characteristics that we would look for to see  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:34):**  whether they do well together or not? What should we observe? Well, one of the things you'll notice  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:39):**  is like if you get, if you, what you can do is a study that's actually called a removal study.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:46):**  And plant ecologists have done this for a long time. Is that what you can do is, you know, split  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:51):**  up your plots down into, you know, like let's do split plots and remove certain species. Like  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:57):**  actually go in and hand weed them. And you can remove them at different percentages, or you can  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:03):**  just remove one species and then remove the next species and then remove the other species. And  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:08):**  then look at what happens to the release of the plants. If none of them do well, then you go,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:13):**  okay. But if some of them all of a sudden start to take off, which is what happens to us, we,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:18):**  we noticed is that we got a bunch of blister beetles that took out some of our cool season  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:23):**  leggings with our sorghum Sudan. And all of a sudden the Sudan took off. So we knew it was like,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:28):**  oh, those guys are all suppressing sorghum Sudan. But that can be an advantage too, because if you  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:33):**  don't want really tall sorghum Sudan, you know, grow some cool season leggings with it and it'll  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:40):**  not grow very tall. There's lots of management practices that need to be perfected. I think a  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:45):**  point that is worth making to a comment that you made earlier, there's still very much that we  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:51):**  don't know about soil biology. There's still very much we don't know about the impacts of various  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:55):**  plants and soil biology and interactions. We do know enough. We already know enough,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:00):**  but if we simply implement what it is that we already know, we can already begin having  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:04):**  very significant successes in developing more disease resistant crops, improving our soil  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:10):**  profiles and so forth. There's many areas that we don't know as much about as we might like. And  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:16):**  one area in particular for me is the area of nutrient density. You mentioned that at the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:22):**  beginning of this conversation, something you've been working on for the last decade or more.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:26):**  What is the interaction? What is the effect of growing different synergistic crop combinations  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:32):**  on nutrient density? And also what is the effect of nutrient density on disease and  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:38):**  insects' acceptability? Oh, wow. Loaded questions, John.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:44):**  Yes, straight for the juggler.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:51):**  The one thing that I have studied is the effects of, and it was on wheat because we're working  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:57):**  left for Alberta, Canada. So that's Southern Alberta, Canada, sort of the northern part of  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:01):**  the Northern Great Plains. We saw that when we replaced the fallow with cover crops,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:10):**  depending on the mixture, and we weren't very fancy. We had two and three species together.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:16):**  But we had 12 combinations. Actually, we had 14 combinations. The one thing that we saw was every  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:22):**  one of them changed the nutrient density of the wheat in the subsequent crop. The yields were very  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:29):**  similar. But the, well, they were similar in some of them where we had things like chicory  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:37):**  in the mix. They were very poor. And in some of them, there was clearly an inhibition on the wheat.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:44):**  One thing that we saw was when we had oats, and remember that we're talking about like  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:49):**  hard red spring wheat, which would be the same, I think, for most wheat. What we saw was that  
**[0:37:55-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:55):**  fava beans and oats and some other legume together grew really well. Cecilia and lentils, buckwheat  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:05):**  and lentils. Buckwheat and lentils was really interesting. It totally ramped up the iron in  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:10):**  the wheat. I mean, it was the highest iron content of any of the wheat was after we had  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:16):**  buckwheat and lentils. And from there, we were just experimenting with, well, what other ones  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:21):**  can we put together? And that's when we started to see more people starting to experiment with  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:27):**  maybe five, six, seven, eight species. And now people are getting fancy with a whole lot more.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:32):**  But we found that with our cropping system, we could change the nutrient density within a year,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:37):**  like just from one crop to the next crop. And now we're seeing with these multi-species,  
**[0:38:42-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:42):**  we have the same thing. So for example, when we grow flax and chickpeas together, flax and garbanzos  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:52):**  together, neither flax doesn't tend to be alive diseases, but the garbs do. And they don't get  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:59):**  nearly the fungal problems with ascochyta, for example, that they would if they were growing by  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:04):**  themselves. If you grow disease, chickpeas, which are more of a wild type chickpeas with flax, I  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:12):**  mean, neither one of them have problems. When we grew, when there was like wheat and faba beans  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:19):**  together, the faba beans had no problems and neither did the wheat. I mean, it was just fine.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:25):**  I mean, it's like there's no disease. I can't explain it. All I can tell you is that I think  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:33):**  that when you mix species up, there's a lot of confusion. One of the things like with insects,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:40):**  for example, if you grow just 18% barley, for example, or oats or anything with your canola,  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:49):**  and that would include growing bees with your canola, you don't have the same amount of flea  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:55):**  beetle or lydus bug damage because when the insects are flying over, they don't see a really  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:00):**  good resource patch. I mean, the intensity of yellow that they would experience from a monoculture  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:05):**  is like, you know, okay, dive, dive, dive. Whereas it's like, oh, that's not very good.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:13):**  We won't be able to do really well in there, but oh, look, the neighbor, that field next to that,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:17):**  oh, that's really intense yellow, let's go there. Every organism is looking to optimize and maximize  
**[0:40:25-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:25):**  its reproductive potential. Right? They all are. And so, you know, if we can mess up the diversity  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:36):**  a little bit or mess up what they're used to, in terms of ecology, we call it disturbance hypothesis.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:43):**  So it's a way of disturbing the norm. And when you disturb the norm, everything has to come to  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:48):**  a new norm. They have to start figuring out what is that or well, how do I get the resources I need?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:56):**  And maybe they have to share or maybe they have to start working together. Maybe some organisms  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:01):**  just have to go into, you know, maybe they get a little bit of something, but they essentially get  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:06):**  excluded from the team. And that's what we're looking for is we're looking to exclude the  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:11):**  pathogens from the team. We know we still have them. We know it will still have some on the roots,  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:16):**  but they won't determine the outcome. And that's the most important thing is that at this point,  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:21):**  we're going, yeah, we acknowledge that you exist and that you're in the soil and you're going to,  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:26):**  you know, have some infection on the roots for sure, but you're not going to be able to overwhelm  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:33):**  everything. And that's our whole goal with diversity is that, yeah, we'll still have some  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:39):**  free beetles and we'll still have some ligands, but they aren't going to do economic damage in  
**[0:41:43-0:41:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:43):**  the same way that they would as a monoculture and nutrition. Well, nutrition is important in every,  
**[0:41:51-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:51):**  in everything. If you have adequate nutrition, your chances of fighting off disease and fighting  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:59):**  off anything are far better than they would be if you do not have adequate nutrition,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:06):**  because it means that your body or in this case, your plant body has all the nutrition  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:12):**  it needs to provide to produce tannins and maybe produce some other compounds that will fight  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:18):**  other infections off. It's getting what it needs. Now, here's the best thing about all that is that  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:25):**  if you don't have to use a lot of energy all the time to be fighting things off, then you can go  
**[0:42:31-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:31):**  on offense, right? So it means that you're doing preventative. So now I'm maintaining a preventative  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:41):**  environment in my plant, which means that the plant can actually be going on open and putting  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:47):**  a lot more energy into reproductive and into its reproductive structures and into growing  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:54):**  more yield if it's not always trying to fight diseases and fight off insects, because think  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:00):**  about how much energy that costs. Think about if I have compacted soils, how much energy I have to  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:05):**  use in order to go through them and get nutrition and stuff. And then that takes away from my yield.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:14):**  If I have well-structured soils and I have any nematode that's trying to puncture my root being  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:20):**  parasitized by a fungi or preyed upon by a fungi, and I have any insect that's trying to eat my roots  
**[0:43:27-0:43:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:27):**  being preyed upon by nematodes and fungi, I'm going to be a lot better off. And I'm not going to have  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:34):**  to waste near as much energy on fighting everything. So what we want to do is make sure plants can be on  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:40):**  the offense and they're not always spending a lot of energy on defense. I mean, they have to do some  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:45):**  defense, but if they can really grow fast and grow vigorously and they have enough mineral nutrition  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:51):**  to do all that and to rapidly produce all the secondary metabolites that they need in order to  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:56):**  defend themselves when that becomes necessary, we're going to have a lot more yield and we're  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:01):**  going to have a lot more nutrient density. And if we have more nutrient density, then that also means  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:07):**  that the plant cells and the cell walls are really tight. And it means that it's really hard for  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:13):**  anything to get in that wants to get in or you can't, it's sort of like you create a fortress  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:18):**  that you can't break into very easily. Like I said, most pathogens are not very competitive  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:24):**  and they're not very strong. So if I make a strong wall, they're going to waste too much energy  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:30):**  themselves trying to break it. So they'll move on. They'll try and move to something else.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:34):**  When we think about all the implications of nutrient density and nutritional integrity,  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:39):**  as I like to call it, when we think about mineral nutritional integrity,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:43):**  it obviously becomes really important to manage that. And of course, if we want to manage it well,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:48):**  that means we need to measure it. You mentioned that, and I've been familiar with your work of  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:54):**  measuring nutrient density with the XRF device. Can you tell us a little bit about  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:58):**  the work that you have done there and where it is leading, what you've discovered and  
**[0:45:02-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:02):**  what the next steps are? Oh, yes. Well, we have been measuring, I've been using X-ray fluorescence,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:11):**  and it's a portable device that I've been using. And actually it's becoming more popular. I'm  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:16):**  seeing more papers on XRF, but we've been, I've developed the calibrations for the XRF. Now,  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:23):**  I like it because if you're going to do mineral nutrient density, you don't have many choices.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:28):**  You're either using XRF or you're using ICP or perhaps atomic absorption in order to analyze  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:38):**  for nutrient density. The beauty of the XRF is that its footprint is the size of an eight and  
**[0:45:45-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:45):**  a half by lemon paper. So it sits right on top of that. It's very portable. So you could be in the  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:53):**  field, anything. The prep time, like for example, for grains is when you need like a coffee grinder,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:00):**  you can use a wide email if you have one, but you grind it up and you put like a half a teaspoon  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:08):**  over the detector and in 30 seconds later you have the full mineral nutrient density if you have a  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:14):**  calibration. And as far as I know, I'm one of the few people calibrating these instruments,  
**[0:46:20-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:20):**  but there's only one that I understand can be calibrated and that's the Bruker Tracer 5i.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:27):**  And so I've been calibrating them so that you can see the parts per million and then start comparing  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:33):**  them between treatments. And I mean, what we've seen is that depending on what we're doing,  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:39):**  we actually have changes in the mineral nutrient density within one season.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:43):**  If we have companions, for example, and we're comparing like potatoes with companions, without  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:50):**  companions, we can see there's a shift in mineral nutrients, but there's also a shift in some of the  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:56):**  other sugars and things like that too, which the XRF can't measure. I started with the XRF just  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:01):**  because it was something that was portable. It was something I could afford. A lot of these  
**[0:47:07-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:07):**  other instruments are, you know, you're looking at 60 or $100,000, whereas in the XRF I can buy  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:14):**  one for $40,000. It's also rugged enough that you can take it places, but it also gave me results  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:22):**  really quickly. And I could look at the number of photons because that's what the instrument does.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:28):**  It looks at the light given off, or the energy given off by the photons when we give,  
**[0:47:36-0:47:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:36):**  when we add more energy to the atoms in the sample. And what we can do is like, even if we  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:42):**  don't have a calibration, we can look and go, ah, I have twice as many calcium photons in this  
**[0:47:47-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:47):**  treatment as I do in this other treatment. So I put more calcium into this grain or into this plant  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:54):**  compared to the other plant. And we see that with potatoes too, that, you know, if you have  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:58):**  grown a cover crop before you grow your potato crop, and this is work we've done in Finland,  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:04):**  then we actually see the change in the potatoes. And not just in, you know, just the mineral  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:12):**  nutrient density, but also in the taste. The chefs that have been tasting these potatoes have ranked  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:18):**  them really high. They say that they taste really a lot different, even the same variety grown in  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:23):**  other ways, that they taste different after they've been grown after a cover crop or with companions.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:28):**  And that is, I mean, that has to also be our goal. So not only do we see an increase in nutrients,  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:37):**  but we also see an improved taste. And ideally we would marry the two. I mean, that would be our  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:43):**  goal. But we're starting to see now, there's more people looking at this, we're starting to see more  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:49):**  impetus on it. And one of the people who've been working on this for a really long time is Ishmael  
**[0:48:54-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:54):**  Tafak, from Turkey. And, you know, he's looked at things maybe in a little different way. But,  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:02):**  you know, he's looked at, like wheat varieties, aging wheat varieties, and why are some of them  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:08):**  zinc, like why do some of them have really high zinc concentrations and other ones have  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:13):**  low zinc concentrations in the same soil? Some of that's because of mycorrhizal, some of that's  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:18):**  the genetics. But these are things that we can look at and go, okay, so maybe I need to fertilize  
**[0:49:24-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:24):**  this one a little bit more, because we know that it's not going to be as good as taking up zinc  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:31):**  as this other variety is, but we want it because it has these other baking quality things that,  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:36):**  you know, so it's a way of also blending things together so that when we bake bread or  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:42):**  when we put a meal together, that we actually have the nutrient, the new mineral nutrition that we  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:50):**  want, and that we are creating the same mineral nutrition within our blend, no matter what year  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:57):**  it is. So maybe we need to add more of this grain from North Dakota with a high selenium and into  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:04):**  this other grain so that we maintain a selenium profile in our flour or in our fermented grains  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:10):**  that is consistent with what the nutritional outcomes we want. And the other thing that  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:16):**  I've really seen a change in was that when we analyze these grains, if they're being used for  
**[0:50:21-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:21):**  seed, you can really, you can almost predict the vigor of a seed based on nutrient density of that  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:29):**  seed, because ideally your seed should be able to germinate in water without anything else and  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:36):**  survive for 10 days if it had to. And seeds that we see like, and this I can only say on wheat,  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:43):**  and the wheat that we've tested, the wheat that really had high nutrient density when we germinated  
**[0:50:48-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:48):**  and left it in water, it grew really rigorously for, you know, eight to ten, eight to twelve days,  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:55):**  and then it needed to be fertilized. The stuff, the seeds that had lower nutrient density  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:00):**  succumbed to fungus and had cesarean and all sorts of things within eight days, right before eight  
**[0:51:07-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:07):**  days, some of them were like four days. So we're setting ourselves up because the new generation  
**[0:51:14-0:51:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:14):**  that we're counting on to grow our plants, if the nutrient density isn't there, then we can't  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:22):**  expect a vigorous plant. I've had many conversations about the importance of seed  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:27):**  quality and how we're setting ourselves up with the need for fungicide applications and  
**[0:51:31-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:31):**  fungicide seed treatments. And really the conversation that we've been having,  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:36):**  when we connect all these different dots, the place we arrive at eventually is a completely  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:42):**  different model of agriculture and agronomy and a completely different way of thinking about  
**[0:51:47-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:47):**  plant and soil interactions from what has been the mainstream for the last seven or eight decades.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:53):**  And within all of that, one of the, there are many people, of course, who desire,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:00):**  I being one of them, who desire to see this system change a bit more rapidly for all the ecosystem  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:06):**  benefits that really need to be brought about. So one of the questions that I have for you is,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:12):**  if there was one thing that you could magically change about the agriculture systems and growing  
**[0:52:16-0:52:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:16):**  systems as they exist today, what would that be? Oh, wow. Someone gave you a magic wand.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:24):**  Yeah. Sprinkled fairy dust and fairy glitter. I know there's that long pause, but  
**[0:52:30-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:30):**  you know, to think about that, I first think that there's so many things that come to mind almost  
**[0:52:37-0:52:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:37):**  instantly, but some of it would be is, I'll break it down into pieces. Culturally speaking,  
**[0:52:46-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:46):**  I would like all of us to be more open-minded about opportunities to use these, these  
**[0:52:54-0:53:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:54):**  techniques to use our understanding of natural ecosystems, to not be afraid that we won't yield.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:02):**  And that's a very tough thing to say to somebody when you require all your income comes from this  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:08):**  one crop. So I'd like us to all be open-minded. If I could change anything, one of the things I  
**[0:53:15-0:53:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:15):**  would do is change the crop insurance regulations so that farmers who wanted to try things and had  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:25):**  done enough test plots could actually do it and still be insured so that they didn't have to be  
**[0:53:30-0:53:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:30):**  afraid of it for their income. Because I think that sometimes it's actually the bureaucracy  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:36):**  and the policies that make it more difficult to be innovative than it should. And I think  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:42):**  there's a limit on innovation. Yeah. Yeah. And so you and I can talk about these things,  
**[0:53:49-0:53:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:49):**  but if I'm going to lose all my crop insurance because I try it, it's hard for me to implement  
**[0:53:56-0:54:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:56):**  that. The other thing I would say to farmers themselves is that try things on a small space.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:04):**  You don't need to do 30 acres. You don't need to do 10 acres. You can actually do one acre.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:09):**  You can even do half an acre or quarter an acre with some of these things and learn how to grow  
**[0:54:13-0:54:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:13):**  them together. Practice it until you actually feel confident that you could put it in the field  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:22):**  at a bigger scale and be absolutely confident that you're going to grow something providing mother  
**[0:54:28-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:28):**  nature, you know, whether it's reasonable. Because it doesn't matter if we use old techniques or new  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:34):**  techniques, if, you know, something really something a large climactic event happens,  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:40):**  it's not going to matter how well we did things. We're going to have a problem.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:44):**  Are we going to recover faster? Absolutely. But we're still going to have a problem,  
**[0:54:48-0:54:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:48):**  maybe a different problem, but a problem. I really like people. I know it's a little bit more  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:54):**  trouble, but there's a lot of organizations out there that would love to put in trials for you.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:59):**  All you have to do is say, hey, I think I'd really like to try this. I just don't know how.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:03):**  And somebody say, maybe we could put them in for you. Is there something in particular you'd like  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:08):**  to do? So I think there's a lot of resources out there for growers to try some things on a small  
**[0:55:14-0:55:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:14):**  scale and start to take the first step towards trying these other practices and getting to know  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:23):**  them and getting to not be afraid of them. That's one of the biggest things I would say.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:27):**  I would agree that there are many resources available for growers to collaborate with.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:31):**  And then, of course, the commitment needs to be made to actually measure and to measure what  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:38):**  happened. And that's often where, in my personal experience and observation, where things fall  
**[0:55:43-0:55:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:43):**  short because harvest season comes, we get super busy and with nothing happens, we don't actually  
**[0:55:51-0:55:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:51):**  measure. And if you don't measure, all your entire effort was wasted. I agree. And so one of the  
**[0:55:57-0:56:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:57):**  things is that if you're going to do this, I agree with John here, you need to make a commitment that  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:04):**  you're actually going to do it. And then you have to work with an organization that is going to put  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:08):**  boots on the ground and actually, because farmers are busy. And if they say, and that's part of the  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:15):**  reason why some of this doesn't happen is because it's like, I'm too busy to do that. I've got all  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:19):**  these other things to do. I've got to make my living for the year. But if you see an organization  
**[0:56:24-0:56:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:24):**  that comes in, then just make sure that they're going to put boots on the ground and they're  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:27):**  going to monitor and then make sure you're going to get some data at the end that you can make a  
**[0:56:31-0:56:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:31):**  decision on. Because in the end, it's about making an informed decision based on science. Too often,  
**[0:56:38-0:56:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:38):**  you know, as farmers like, oh, control. Well, what is that? Oh, I did the whole 30 acres. Did you  
**[0:56:45-0:56:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:45):**  compare it to something? Oh, no, because I figured it would work. So I just did it.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:49):**  These things, there's researchers, there's extension, there's NRCS. A lot of them are  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:53):**  out there to try and help you make these experiments. But you have to insist that they  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:57):**  be responsible. You can put them on your land, put up the land, but make sure that they're  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:02):**  responsible for collecting the data and monitoring the data and then giving you the report at the end  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:07):**  of the year. So that's the advice I'd say there. Jill, we've discussed a lot of very important  
**[0:57:14-0:57:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:14):**  topics lightly. And I would love to have more follow up conversations to dive a bit more deeply  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:19):**  into some of these. But in the meantime, where can people go to learn more? I recommend to people,  
**[0:57:25-0:57:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:25):**  there's a book by Walter Larster. It was translated from German. It's ecological. What is it? The  
**[0:57:35-0:57:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:35):**  ecological physiology of plants. It's an outstanding resource. It's written quite simply,  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:41):**  the new version is a textbook, the old one is a paperback. But regardless of which one you get,  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:47):**  it sort of ties a lot of the dots together. If you're interested in plant disease, of course,  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:53):**  the book for you, Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease is an outstanding book talking how  
**[0:57:59-0:58:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:59):**  mineral nutrition actually input affects disease and that's by Dr. Don Huberter. And then the  
**[0:58:08-0:58:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:08):**  Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants, which is the new version, has a lot of input by Petra  
**[0:58:15-0:58:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:15):**  Marciner, of course Marciner's daughter. And that book is something that if you want to understand  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:23):**  what mineral nutrition does to the plant, that is an excellent one. The one by Larster actually  
**[0:58:30-0:58:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:30):**  even talks about organisms and how important organisms are for changing things. And then,  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:37):**  of course, there's the standard soil book by Brady. I think it's Wilds and Brady.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:43):**  And that book also talks about soil fauna. It talks about interactions with mycorrhiza  
**[0:58:50-0:58:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:50):**  and bacteria in terms of the whole soil structure sort of thing. So I think that there are some  
**[0:58:58-0:59:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:58):**  standard resources out there that can really make a difference. And then, of course, there are a ton  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:04):**  of YouTube videos by people who are talking about these things. Of course, there's always the Dave  
**[0:59:12-0:59:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:12):**  Brown work. You can go to various organizations and they have YouTube videos. I have YouTube  
**[0:59:20-0:59:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:20):**  videos out there I know talking about basic soil biology and how all these things fit together.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:27):**  Dr. Chris Nichols, she has some great stuff. Christine Jones has talked about some good stuff.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:32):**  I know there's a new book out by Nicole Master. But people who are talking about interactions and  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:37):**  researching interactions and then transforming them. And of course, there's your work too, John,  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:42):**  and the people that you're interviewing and some of your own work that you're publishing.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:47):**  And just organizing the work of others largely, it seems.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:50):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:52):**  Yeah. A lot of incredible work out there.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:54):**  Yeah. And I think that the new book by David Montgomery and Ann Bickley talking about  
**[1:00:01-1:00:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:01):**  neuro-nutrition is going to show all the gaps, like a lot of gaps in what we know. And so I  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:08):**  think there's going to be... I hope that I see that there's going to be a lot more work on  
**[1:00:13-1:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:13):**  neuro-nutrition. But some of it is just where we look. And I think you might agree on this is that  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:19):**  there's work in other places that we don't normally check. So work in other fields that  
**[1:00:25-1:00:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:25):**  you're like, oh, well, that actually would apply here. There's a lot of work on medicinal herbs  
**[1:00:32-1:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:32):**  that would totally apply to what we're talking about in journals of alternative plant medicine.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:40):**  Things that a lot of agronomists would never look at, but are there. And if you get your head  
**[1:00:46-1:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:46):**  outside of agronomy and actually read plant physiology journals or soil ecology journals,  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:52):**  then you get start to see some more of the bigger picture because scientists tend to publish on  
**[1:00:57-1:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:57):**  their own discipline and be very strong in their discipline, but not multidisciplinary. And so  
**[1:01:03-1:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:03):**  you need to read in all the different disciplines. And then people like you and I,  
**[1:01:09-1:01:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:09):**  John, try and put it all together in a bigger picture. And I think that's actually one of my  
**[1:01:15-1:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:15):**  strengths is I see the big picture. I see where the holes are. I see. And then I start reading  
**[1:01:21-1:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:21):**  something and go, oh, that piece sticks over here in that great puzzle. And it's a puzzle.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:29):**  It's just, you've got to be a puzzler. You have to be able to collect and identify the puzzle  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:33):**  pieces and see where they fit. And I agree with you. That is an underrepresented skill in our  
**[1:01:39-1:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:39):**  scientific community and a very necessary and important one in the agricultural space  
**[1:01:43-1:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:43):**  in particular, because there are so many overlapping fields that all tie in and  
**[1:01:47-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:47):**  connect together. There's also plant pathology and botany and entomology and understanding all  
**[1:01:54-1:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:54):**  those interactions and what's happening, what's going on becomes very necessary and important if  
**[1:01:59-1:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:59):**  we want to put together regenerative and sustainable ecosystems. I mean, think about how  
**[1:02:05-1:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:05):**  plants and insects talk. I mean, there are some great YouTube videos on that where you can  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:12):**  actually learn about how plants talk to insects and insects talk to plants and how they fight  
**[1:02:17-1:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:17):**  each other off or how they work together. And it blows your mind when you first start looking at it  
**[1:02:23-1:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:23):**  and you're like, wow, look at that. That's pretty amazing. Going back to the comment that I made  
**[1:02:27-1:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:27):**  once earlier, there is no shortage of information today. Yes, there are additional things we might  
**[1:02:32-1:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:32):**  like to know, but we already know enough that if we simply implement what we already know,  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:36):**  we would be in a very different space agriculturally and as a society as well in  
**[1:02:41-1:02:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:41):**  many different ways and many different levels. Jill, this has been a wonderful conversation.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:45):**  Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and your wisdom and insights. And I look forward to  
**[1:02:49-1:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:49):**  having more discussions with you in the future. And I enjoyed myself very much. So thank you.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:57):**  The team at AEA and I are dedicated to bringing this show to you because we believe that knowledge  
**[1:03:02-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:02):**  and information is the foundation of successful regenerative systems at AEA. We believe that  
**[1:03:08-1:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:08):**  growing better quality food and making more money from your crops is possible. And since 2006, we've  
**[1:03:15-1:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:15):**  worked with leading professional growers to help them do just that. At AEA, we don't guess, we test,  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:21):**  we analyze, and we provide recommendations based on scientific data, knowledge, and experience.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:27):**  We've developed products that are uniquely positioned to help growers make more money  
**[1:03:31-1:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:31):**  with regenerative agriculture. If you are a professional grower who believes in testing  
**[1:03:36-1:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/developing-disease-suppressive-soil-with-jill-clapperton/#t=1:03:36):**  instead of guessing, someone who believes in a better, more regenerative way to grow,

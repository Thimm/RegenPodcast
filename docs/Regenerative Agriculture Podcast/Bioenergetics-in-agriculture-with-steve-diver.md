### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Sat, 23 Jun 2018 01:16:09)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere and when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:33):**  resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:01:59):**  thank you very much for listening. Enjoy the show. Greetings friends and welcome to the  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:04):**  Regenerative Agriculture podcast. On this podcast, we explore the science and practical application  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:11):**  of regenerative agriculture ecosystems and talk about how to regenerate soil and crop health  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:17):**  and quality and how to increase farm profitability. In this episode, I am very excited to welcome  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:24):**  Steve Dever to our show. Steve has had a fascinating journey working with many different  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:32):**  aspects and facets of ecological agriculture in a number of different endeavors, both in the field  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:38):**  consulting and also with some work at the USDA. Steve, we're very excited to have you. Thank you  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:44):**  for joining us. Hey, good evening, Don. Thanks for the invitation. I look forward to meeting with you  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:50):**  and I've been watching your work and I look forward to continuing our conversation. Thanks.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:02:57):**  So Steve, you've done some fascinating work over the years in a number of different areas. So what  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:03):**  have been some of the memorable moments that led you to where you are today and the projects that  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:08):**  you're working on? Yeah, one of the memorable times was I was working as an extension horticulture agent  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:15):**  in Muskogee County, Oklahoma and got permission to go travel to the Anchors USA conference, which was in  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:22):**  1985. And that really set me on a journey of this discovery of what this large topic called  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:29):**  eco-agriculture. Met a lot of interesting people there that led to many long-time  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:35):**  friendships and attending seminars and so forth. But another thing around that same time was  
**[0:03:42-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:42):**  another trip I took also to Missouri to attend a bio-organic orcharding workshop that was led by  
**[0:03:50-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:50):**  Michael Malthus. And basically he was a master farmer, a really great gardener farmer from South  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:03:58):**  Africa who started a small farm there and was doing biodynamic farming. So I really got a great  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:04):**  introduction to really solid type of organic farming and biodynamic farming. And there was a  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:10):**  dairy nearby called Morningland Dairy that he made their compost and did all the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:17):**  biodynamic preparations for them and so forth. But as a young extension agent that really impressed  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:23):**  me and really gave me the confidence based on this experience of a really good farmer who could  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:29):**  explain things and show us how superb his soil had improved and how spongy and emissive it was  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:36):**  and so forth. Just all that good stuff. When you attended this workshop and when you attended the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:42):**  ACRES conference, what were the pieces that stood out to you as being different from the work that  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:48):**  you had been doing up to that point? Well that's the whole introduction. My college education  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:04:55):**  in horticulture and soil started in the late 1970s and then I started doing work in the early 1980s.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:07):**  Even when I started in college I was interested in organic agriculture and would go to the library  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:12):**  and pull out the books that were interesting. But the whole ACRES USA experience has stuck with me  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:19):**  and have ended up giving lectures at the conference several times. So just as an example,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:26):**  the way I frame some of my teaching and workshops that I share with farmers is something that I  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:33):**  taught at the ACRES USA conference in the year 2000. They wanted a presentation on  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:41):**  eco-agriculture. So after many years of getting the conference and seminars and putting two and  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:47):**  two together, the way that I frame eco-agriculture is the three pillars and that is minerals, biology  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:05:53):**  and bioenergetics. So that minerals including soil testing, either re-mineralization or some  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:01):**  mineral balancing scheme that typically would be associated with Dr. William Albrecht or Harry  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:07):**  Reems. The biology side including humus management, organic matter management, soil biology, soil  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:13):**  biota, soil food web. And then the third leg of the stool would be this bioenergetic physics.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:21):**  That would include things along the line of photosynthesis and redox and cellular metabolism,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:28):**  but also include this whole genre of alternative terms like subtle energy, scalar energy,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:35):**  bio-resonance, coherence, structured water, so on and so forth. So yeah, that early experience  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:41):**  has kind of stuck with me and gelled into a lifelong learning process.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:47):**  Very often when in the agriculture space, when I hear economists and teachers speak about  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:06:55):**  the three pillars, what I expect to hear about is the three pillars of soil health being a mineral,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:02):**  the mineral component, the biological component and the physical component of soil aggregation  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:06):**  and so forth. So you have a slightly different twist on that and the bioenergetic piece seems  
**[0:07:14-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:14):**  like an intriguing perspective. What led you to add that piece to minerals and biology in looking  
**[0:07:22-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:22):**  at what was happening in soil ecosystems? So for example, on this large umbrella that Acres USA  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:31):**  conferences include have many different what I call pioneers who really, you know,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:37):**  blazed a new trail. And then you have many teachers who are the authors and consultants and  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:44):**  putting on seminars and running labs, working with farmers based on a soil test and putting together  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:51):**  a protocol or a program of fertility regime, trying that out in the field, seeing how it works,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:07:58):**  making some tweaks, trying again over many, many years, they're getting these really great results  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:02):**  in comparison like before and after or the comparison between the biological or eco-farming  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:09):**  approach versus the conventional approach. So anyways, this three legs of the stool kind of  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:16):**  emerged out of that. So you have many of these teachers emphasizing soil testing, mineralization,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:22):**  increasing crop vitality, increasing pest resistance. You have another set of teachers  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:27):**  who are emphasizing the soil food web, compost, compost teas, humus management. And then you have  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:34):**  this other set of teachers, which included people like Phil Callahan, who I would meet in the  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:39):**  hallways, have discussions, go to dinner with him, in the mini lecture volume, who is talking about  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:45):**  paramagnetism, a weak magnetic field, the influence of these energies on cellular coherence and  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:53):**  crop mechanics. The better you can get the paramagnetism in the soil, the better the crop health  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:08:58):**  is. And then other things, people talking about bricks, people talking about redox. So that's why  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:03):**  I came up with that third leg. And that's why I put that out there to do my workshops and  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:09):**  and have shared that with farmers all over the country.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:13):**  I'd love to unwrap the bioenergetic piece a little bit. You've mentioned a number of different  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:20):**  areas. And I'm sure each one of these could be a topic for discussion in one of these episodes,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:28):**  all in and of themselves. But let's just focus for the moment on a couple of the pieces that  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:35):**  you mentioned. One of the pieces that you spoke of was redox. And I find that many growers,  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:42):**  when you talk about soil pH, water pH, almost any farmer will have some degree of understanding  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:50):**  of pH and the importance of pH. And yet there's almost no conversation for the most part around  
**[0:09:57-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:09:57):**  EH or redox, which from my observation, if anything, it seems to have an even bigger impact  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:05):**  on nutrient availability and possible pathogens in the soil profile than pH does. So I'd love to  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:12):**  hear your perspective on redox. Why is redox important? And why does it matter?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:17):**  John, you may have to go into my notes and pull all that out of there. But so one thing to start  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:23):**  off with is we do have a meter, ORP meter, oxidation reduction potential, that's when we  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:29):**  talk about redox, that a lot of times what we use to measure that. So for example, you can get an  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:35):**  EC meter or electrical conductivity, you can get a pH meter. But this third one is a little less  
**[0:10:41-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:41):**  known, but it is used, it's popular amongst eco agriculture consultants, and different people  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:50):**  have different ways of using it and comparing the results, getting an understanding and based on  
**[0:10:56-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:10:56):**  that, making some adjustments. So as one example, one of the microbes I've brewed is a probiotic,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:05):**  it has lactobacillus and yeast and phototropic bacteria, and we would ferment that with some herbs  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:12):**  and some rock dust, some paramagnetism, and we would then measure the redox, the ORP,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:20):**  and we wanted that to have a higher negative reading and get a better quality, that kind of  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:26):**  thing. You'll see people also with these various kinds of alkalizing water devices, they're talking  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:34):**  about the same thing, they're doing an ORP reading, getting a redox, and they're looking  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:40):**  for that higher level. So one of the humus management systems that I've worked with is  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:49):**  humified composting, it's also known as LubeKey composting. So a group of us have traveled over  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:11:57):**  to Europe, to Austria, to study with Siegfried and UtulubeKey and studied how they make compost,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:03):**  add clay to it, add microbes to it, add rock dust to it, turn it with a really nice turner,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:08):**  cover the pile with a compost fleece blanket, and really aim for a high-grade premium compost that  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:15):**  has got humified, has clay humus in it, but on the tail end they'll do a whole spectrum of compost  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:22):**  quality assessment and they do various things, but included in that is a redox reading. So  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:28):**  I think I'll just leave it at that. People would have to dig into a little bit more technical  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:32):**  detail on some of those measurements and how you evaluate them.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:37):**  Okay, great. In the consulting work and the agronomy work that you have done over the years,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:44):**  what has been something that has surprised you? What was unexpected?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:48):**  Good question. Well, here's one. This may not be what you're expecting, but this was a  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:12:56):**  surprising thing that came out of my work in Texas that really led to some really great insights.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:04):**  That was working with a ranch and doing soil food web testing and finding out that prairies  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:12):**  have a very fungal nature to them. We did some tests on a tall grass prairie southwest of Fort  
**[0:13:19-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:19):**  Worth, that area, and found that the fungal to bacterial ratio was 7 to 1. It was actually 7.5 to 1.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:27):**  So then we, based on some other work I was doing, we found other prairies. The same thing. It'd be  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:33):**  like 4 to 1, you know, 3.5, 4 to 1, 5 to 1. That led to a really amazing amount of work that we did  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:42):**  with using compost teas and extracts and what we refer to as liquid biological amendments.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:49):**  So an LBA or liquid biological amendment could be a tank mix with a liquid compost extract plus a  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:13:56):**  home-brewed microbial inoculant plus molasses plus c-mink acid, seaweed, little rock dust, maybe a  
**[0:14:04-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:04):**  homeopathic energy pattern that was added to the water and then used to manage pastures, orchards,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:12):**  landscapes, roadside vegetation, vineyards, pecan orchards, and based on that concept of the soil  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:19):**  food succession of the bacterial to fungal ratio. So that little, that little, that was a  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:26):**  little surprise. It was a little unexpected find that we followed that. We did a lot more testing  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:33):**  in different places and we put two and two together and that really became a significant  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:39):**  roadmap. What was the crop response that you observed from those applications? Well again,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:46):**  say if you're managing a pasture, you've got, you have a really good example of succession in action.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:14:54):**  You can, and also, you know, you're, when I refer to managing these pastures, we're usually referring  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:02):**  to some kind of a holistic grazing system as well. So it's the dual combination of using this tool  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:09):**  of a liquid biological amendment and a management practice with some kind of rotational grazing or  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:14):**  some kind of mob grazing. But the two of them together, you can really see really impressive  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:20):**  changes in species composition. And so you're improving the species of the forage mix and  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:26):**  you're increasing the diversity of the forage mix in the biomass production versus, you know,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:33):**  plain, plain, extensive grazing. So in orchard systems like a pecan orchard, you are totally working with  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:42):**  a perennial tree that is native to bottomland hardwood forests. That kind of environment is a  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:50):**  totally naturally fungal rich dominated type of a system. And so when you're managing for that kind  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:15:57):**  of a perennial orchard or a vineyard crop, you know that that would be more fungal. So what you can do  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:03):**  is you can select from, for example, two or three different compost substrates and you can do like  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:09):**  a 50-50 blend or a 75-25 blend of a compost and a vermin compost, aiming for a more fungal nature  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:17):**  of your compost extract. So you're adding this biology and then you're also stimulating biology  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:23):**  with these microbial food sources like humic acid and seaweed. Yeah, so once you've got this roadmap,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:29):**  once you understand this succession, the above ground plant succession is mirrored by a below  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:35):**  ground soil food web succession. That's the roadmap. And then your tool and your management  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:39):**  system can work with that and then you can kind of see change in species composition.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:45):**  You can see improvement in health of the crop and so forth. So I want to make sure that I'm  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:51):**  understanding you correctly. Are you suggesting that you can, earlier you were describing the use  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:16:58):**  of these liquid biological amendments. Are you suggesting that you can change not only the health  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:06):**  but also not only the health of the crops that you're growing but also the types of plants that  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:12):**  would become dominant, let's say in a pasture ecosystem for example, based on the application  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:18):**  of biological inoculants to the soil profile? Yes, I am. We had a farm down there we called  
**[0:17:25-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:25):**  the postage stamp farm. It was a property that they, it was a large rectangle of a  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:34):**  bermudagrass based forage system that was surrounded by a larger property of, let's see,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:43):**  K-hour bluestem. K-hour bluestem is in lower sectional grass, lower quality forage and so  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:51):**  using these liquid biological amendments in this rectangle versus the outer perimeter,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:17:56):**  we could establish a healthy base of this bermudagrass, forage and hay fields etc.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:04):**  And almost do the exact line where we spray these liquid biological amendments,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:10):**  the K-hour bluestem would not encroach on that. Wow. So that was a good one. That's why we call  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:17):**  that the postage stamp farm because that's what it looked like from an aerial view.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:21):**  Thank you. So one of the questions that often gets asked is when we consider applying biological  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:34):**  inoculants to a soil profile, how do we ensure that that inoculant that we're applying actually  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:42):**  survives? How do we know that a compost tea for example isn't here today and gone tomorrow?  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:49):**  How many tools can we use to make sure it has a bigger impact for the longer term?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:18:55):**  We always work with microscopes and lab testing and just kind of a constant follow-up with  
**[0:19:06-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:06):**  qualitative assessments. But that is a good question and they talk about the soldiers  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:17):**  in Normandy Beach, just hundreds of thousands of these bacteria that are wiped out in the first  
**[0:19:24-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:24):**  wave of the solar ultraviolet light coming down and the harsh environment of the soil and the  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:34):**  plant etc. But some of those will survive, colonize, get established, start creating a biofilm  
**[0:19:40-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:40):**  set themselves etc. So it's the combination of doing microscopic analysis, qualitative  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:50):**  assessment, some lab testing etc. Got it. Steve, what has been something that has puzzled you  
**[0:19:57-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:19:57):**  for a long time? One of the things that puzzled me is the slow nature of agriculture as a whole.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:07):**  The industry, the government, the educational system to adapt to new technologies and concepts  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:18):**  more quickly. The very risk averse, very conservative field. So just for example,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:26):**  just referring to this topic on bioenergetics. Look at the progress of bioenergetics in  
**[0:20:33-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:33):**  complementary and alternative medicine or holistic health practitioners. How far they have adopted,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:43):**  how far this technology has evolved and it's a parallel to another life science known as  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:49):**  agriculture. But you know because farmers are very risk averse, they have crops that they're  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:20:56):**  depending on, they have loans that they have to make, they have incredibly expensive operations  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:02):**  that they're managing, they've got bankers who are working with them. The culture is just more  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:09):**  conservative. But you know so that's part of it. I recognize that, that's the plain field. I think  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:17):**  it's just going to take longer for some of these concepts and technologies to be more broadly  
**[0:21:24-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:24):**  adopted. But yeah that puzzled me. When obviously you believe that growers would benefit from  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:36):**  adopting this technology which is why it's puzzling that they haven't. One of the questions  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:41):**  that I have for you is what does the opportunity look like to you? How much opportunity are growers  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:48):**  leaving on the table by not taking advantage of some of these emerging technologies and adapting  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:21:56):**  them more quickly? Well I think your podcast and your outreach is a good example John. So  
**[0:22:06-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:06):**  you know what we're offering by adapting eco-agriculture, increasing crop vitality,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:17):**  veering in on minerals, the role they play all the way from cellular metabolism to  
**[0:22:23-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:23):**  pest resistance, improving crop health, crop yield, improving integrating biology  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:34):**  and compost and organic matter, improving the living soil environment,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:39):**  getting better nutrient cycling, you know the effect of mycorrhizae and rhizobacteria,  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:46):**  how they work in concert with plants and how they have co-evolved over hundreds of millions  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:52):**  of years so it's really a natural thing. And then this whole third leg of the stool, this  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:22:58):**  bioenergetic or bio-resonants, all that leads to crops that are able to, you know,  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:06):**  they're able to perform well, yield well, better pest resistance, better nutritional profile,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:15):**  nutrient density, and without relying on so many, you know, chemical inputs. So that's got to be a  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:23):**  plus. So if you think, you know, that's something farmers would really gravitate to, I think there  
**[0:23:29-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:29):**  is a really an amazing new awareness now on the soil health front which is great. You know,  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:37):**  NRCS has done a great job picking that message up, working with soil biology and multi-species  
**[0:23:44-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:44):**  cover crops. That stuff is super exciting. But at the same time, when you follow what's going on in  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:23:52):**  the soil health field, it's like everything that has been gained, understanding William Albrecht  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:00):**  and Kerry Reems on soil testing and mineral balancing is like it's kind of taking a back seat.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:07):**  People don't even talk about it anymore. All these different things in play and understand that it's  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:12):**  the integration of all these together. It's not just one. If you focus on one area by itself,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:17):**  you know, some pioneers, that's what they do. They're really good at it. But when it comes down  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:22):**  to it, you know, you got to have a little bit of this, a little bit of that to make it all work.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:26):**  One of the pieces I've personally been very intrigued by in just in our own consulting  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:32):**  work at Advancing Eco-Agriculture and also observing other very successful consultants  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:39):**  and agronomists who are in this field is the substantial yield responses and cooperation  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:46):**  and quality responses that these integrated systems are able to produce. So when we talk  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:24:54):**  about improving disease and insect resistance, improving quality, it's exciting and it's fun  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:01):**  to get to produce higher test weight corn or larger strawberries or larger fruit  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:09):**  or higher protein content wheat. And there is also an economic benefit there as well to producing  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:16):**  higher quality and greater disease and insect resistance. But I think the piece that has really  
**[0:25:21-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:21):**  intrigued me is that in many cases, in fact, I would go so far as to say in most cases,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:31):**  when these regenerative ecosystems are principles are applied on a farm, almost invariably,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:41):**  there is a strong yield response. Depending on the conditions in the local situation, that may  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:47):**  take some time for to express itself. But often we find it happens in the first year, definitely  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:25:54):**  by the second or third year. Many of the growers that we work with observe very substantial yield  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:00):**  responses, usually in double digits and sometimes well into double digits. And I'm surprised that  
**[0:26:05-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:05):**  that piece hasn't been communicated more. And so this is one of the questions that I have for you  
**[0:26:15-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:15):**  is when you look at, you've been describing adding this bioenergetic piece in addition to  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:24):**  the mineral and biological component. When you bring all of those pieces together,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:29):**  and you implement them on a farm, and they're implemented well, what does the,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:33):**  well, let me ask the question this way. Based on your experience, how much opportunity do many  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:40):**  commercial growers have left on the table that they have not tapped into? What does,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:45):**  what does, what do the possibilities really look like?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:49):**  Well, as you're talking about chemical growers, so let's call that conventional agriculture.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:26:55):**  Yeah, let me just go over another angle that I share in my workshops first, and then I'll  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:01):**  talk about that. I'll address that part. So I think it's important we have in modern  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:09):**  portrayal of agriculture as a dichotomy of organic versus conventional. So you'll hear that a lot.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:17):**  You know, popular in the media, things are framed that way. But let me just go over  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:22):**  things are framed that way. But let's remember that you have, you have organic,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:29):**  you have sustainable. We've been talking about eco agriculture. There's another system, various  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:37):**  other alternative farming systems called, for example, permaculture, biodynamic farming,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:44):**  Korean natural farming, zero budget natural farming. And in traditional, just integrated  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:51):**  crop livestock, and holistic grazing. So what I mean is that there's a variation on a theme.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:27:58):**  These, these other ones I've been referring to the new term is regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:03):**  I think that's a really good term because it means that you can regenerate and improve the  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:09):**  ecology of the farm. So and then everything else is just lumped as conventional. But what you'll,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:17):**  what you see is these conventional farmers also vary. Some of them are doing a little  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:22):**  bit of no till, they're doing cover crops, they're adapting various types of sustainable.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:28):**  So we definitely want to leave farmers some room to breathe and, you know, think about how they're  
**[0:28:34-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:34):**  doing things or portray how they're doing things. But I think for the, what the so called conventional  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:42):**  farmer who's still relying mostly on chemical inputs, there is a whole wealth of information  
**[0:28:47-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:47):**  out there. And also field days, workshops, conferences they can plug into, learn about  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:28:56):**  these things, go see what other people are doing. Yeah, something as basic as adding cover crops  
**[0:29:04-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:04):**  to a farm has been a huge thing. When the USDA program got started in the early 1990s,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:15):**  and all the way to now one of the premier things that it has emphasized this whole time is cover  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:22):**  crops. And now you have people that are doing multi species cover crops. And some people are  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:30):**  doing 10 way or 20 way. One of the comments from several people is that if you can get  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:36):**  six different species in your cover crop mix, because of the different root morphologies,  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:43):**  and because of the different kinds of root exudates that come out of these different species.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:48):**  So for example, you'll have some kind of a cereal in there like barley or rye, a legume in there  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:29:55):**  like venture or clover, a broadleaf in there like radish or rapeseed or something like that,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:03):**  or buckwheat or calpe. These different species will exude different things down in the soil,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:09):**  they'll stimulate the soul food web, the soul food web and the roots will tie together the soil,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:15):**  improve soil aggregation, porosity, infiltration, deposition of organic matter, nutrient cycling,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:23):**  it's really impressive. So those are things farmers can adopt. And then there's just a whole  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:31):**  toolbox of things that chemical farmers can plug into. Adding compost extracts.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:39):**  You can make these in large, large quantities and put them out in 1000 gallon nurse tanks,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:48):**  pull them behind a tractor, put some saddle mounted tanks on a tractor. You can inject  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:30:55):**  things into the drill row when you're planting, improve the soil biology and the humus going on  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:02):**  in the soil, the minerals in the soil, etc. So yeah, this bioenergetic one, that's the last one.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:07):**  It's kind of like the icing on the cake. What I tell people is that you really need to have  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:11):**  the fundamentals down first. It's important to provide proper organic matter management,  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:18):**  proper nutrition, soil fertility. That's the foundation, that is the foundation of health  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:25):**  for the crop and for the livestock. Adding in bioenergetic modality, some kind of bio resonance.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:32):**  It could be some kind of structured water, or some kind of a scaler energy, or agro homeopathy,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:41):**  some kind of bioinformatic preparation. These things have various kinds of subtle energy  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:47):**  qualities that they can impart that can tie things together. And it's kind of like the icing on the  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:31:53):**  cake. And again, it's all about improving the soil health, crop health, livestock health,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:00):**  livestock health, and vitality and nutrition. Steve, you've had the perspective of working  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:07):**  with many different crops in many different types of environments and many different growers.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:12):**  What is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture that is perhaps not  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:20):**  in a mainstream view? Well, many. There's many, there's many, many parts of  
**[0:32:26-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:26):**  modern agriculture that is just waiting to discover what's going on in alternative agriculture.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:36):**  So I've kind of gone over those alternative farming systems. But let's just take an example.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:43):**  One of those alternative farming systems I mentioned is Korean natural farming.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:48):**  Now that's exciting. They're also, that's coming out of Korea, Asia,  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:32:54):**  it's spreading around, it's really big in Hawaii now. And then kind of a cousin to that is zero  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:00):**  budget natural farming that's grown in India. These guys are taking raw biomass on the farm,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:08):**  like leaves off of native plants or maybe herbs that they've grown, and then putting them in a  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:15):**  bucket, adding sugar and fermenting them to create a fermented plant juice. They're doing the same  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:21):**  thing with fruit. So they're creating a fermented plant juice, fruit juice, and various other  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:27):**  concoctions that they can make, lactobacillus they can make on the farm, various other kind of  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:34):**  recipes. But let's think about what they're doing. They're taking a raw natural  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:41):**  biomass source on the farm. And by putting together a recipe, adding some sugar to it,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:48):**  and fermenting it, they're creating both an extract that has soluble nutrients,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:33:56):**  it has beneficial microbiology in it, and it has beneficial bio substances in it, things like  
**[0:34:03-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:03):**  enzymes and organic acids and hormones. And so all that can be created right on the farm.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:11):**  And that can be used for fertility and for pest control and costs very little, very healthy,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:19):**  very beneficial. And so that's just a few examples. The opportunity really has  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:27):**  never been this good. I think the thing for farmers who are listening, who are in your  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:34):**  audience, John, who are picking up on some of this and curious, yeah, just I think the thing to do  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:39):**  is just read some more books, tap into some of these topics, learn about them, and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:47):**  try a little bit out at a time. Add it slowly to the farm system, do some test strips,  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:34:53):**  do some comparison results and see how they work. And usually they find that they'll  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:00):**  go get something beneficial out of it. Just adding cover crops, just increasing the species  
**[0:35:06-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:06):**  of cover crops can really make a big difference. You mentioned that farmers should try to learn  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:14):**  more about these various ideas and systems. What are some resources or books that you often  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:21):**  recommend to growers? Well, that's a big topic, but yeah, I think one thing to do is just get  
**[0:35:27-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:27):**  look at the Acres USA bookstore and go through there and kind of plug in around what I think  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:36):**  is really helpful, these three pillars of eco-agriculture or the three legs of the stool.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:42):**  Look at some of these books by some of the authors on biological farming, mineral balancing,  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:51):**  in the Albright tradition, people like Gary Zimmer and Neal Kinsey, some of their books.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:35:59):**  Then some of the other books by on Terry Reems by Dan Skow, those kind of guys.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:05):**  Read some different books on soil biology, compost, and humus management.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:12):**  Then they have other books on there. They have got some books on  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:15):**  bio magnetism and bio-dynamic agriculture. Take through there, find something that's appealing,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:23):**  read a little bit at a time, and put two and two together. It's a lifelong learning process.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:29):**  Absolutely is a lifelong learning process. I think in a conversation earlier,  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:37):**  one of the pieces that really stood out for me was that you have to have a lot of  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:44):**  experience. You are the expert on your farm. Study books and try to learn what you can,  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:51):**  but then pay attention. Pay attention to what's happening on your farm. Observe and ask questions  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:36:58):**  and try to understand why certain things are happening. I think when we begin questioning  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:03):**  what's happening and what's going on, that really speeds up the learning process very quickly.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:08):**  You know, one thing I've learned about farmers is they are incredibly innovative,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:18):**  a wealth of knowledge. Take the average farmer, it doesn't matter if they're conventional,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:27):**  sustainable, organic. Look at all the different things that they do to manage their farm. They  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:33):**  do mechanical work, electrical work, bookkeeping, soil fertility, pest control,  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:40):**  raising crops and livestock, taking care of them, marketing them, keeping the business going.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:48):**  But another thing is this brain tower. I've had the opportunity to travel to India  
**[0:37:55-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:37:55):**  and work on small farms in India and see how they do things in different parts of the world  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:05):**  I've been to. One of the things I see is that this real common theme is the brain tower  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:12):**  that farmers have. So just think about a typical day that they're out there working  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:17):**  and maybe they're driving a tractor down some long rows, doing some cultivation or some mowing,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:24):**  or some harvesting. Think about the time they have to think. That time that they have to think  
**[0:38:29-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:29):**  and observe is a real rich pool of ideas. So they can figure things out. Here's a couple  
**[0:38:38-0:38:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:38):**  examples. You're growing some plants, you plant them at the same time, and one plant over here  
**[0:38:46-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:46):**  in this container or in this row is doing way better than this other plant right next to it.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:38:55):**  So that's a great question. What's going on there? Is there some fertility issue?  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:02):**  Again, is there some kind of bioenergetic thing that you could do to increase the vitality  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:07):**  of that plant? Another one that I like is observing weeds growing. This kind of goes  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:13):**  back to succession. Why are the weeds growing? What's the history of that field?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:19):**  Is there something that you could do to change the management history or the cultural practice  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:25):**  to suppress those weeds longer? So those kinds of questions are very interesting. They can really  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:32):**  lead to some new discoveries and try new things out. Steve, what is the question you wish I would  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:37):**  have asked in this conversation? We could have a really long conversation and maybe we need to  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:43):**  follow up on that sometime, John. It is a little more in-depth on some of these bioenergetic  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:50):**  modalities. Let me just throw out some terms. I may have mentioned a couple of those, but  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:39:56):**  some key terms like bioresonant, coherent, electromagnetic frequencies, vitality. What  
**[0:40:02-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:02):**  do they mean? What can you find out about them? My suggestion is to look on Google or  
**[0:40:12-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:12):**  search engine, look under holistic health, look at what's going on in holistic agriculture.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:20):**  You can really learn a lot right there on that one. Some of the modalities that I would  
**[0:40:27-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:27):**  point farmers to that are probably, let's say, more practical, more proven. I like scalar energy.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:38):**  I actually keep a scalar pendant. You can use that to energize and charge water and fertilizers.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:47):**  There's another field known as agro homeopathy. It's gaining a lot of  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:53):**  let's say, a proven track at various university research now. Structured water is another one  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:40:59):**  that farmers are really tapping into. Para magnetism, various other ones.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:05):**  Certainly, I think that can be a topic for an entire in-depth conversation in and of itself,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:12):**  Steve. We will need to follow up with that conversation at some point because it is  
**[0:41:17-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:17):**  an emerging field. I can speak from experience that there are some of these technologies that  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:26):**  can produce some very profound effects when they are managed well and applied properly.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:33):**  I've got this concept that we go through different eras. Coming out of World War II,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:41):**  we've gone through the period of World War II. We've gone through the period of the war.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:46):**  World War II, we've gone through the chemical era. Right now, we're tapping into the biological and ecological era.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:41:55):**  I think that down the road as time goes by and as these terms and concepts and technologies become  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:05):**  more proven that they'll become more acceptable. They're probably considered on the fringe  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:11):**  right now by some people, both medical and agriculture,  
**[0:42:18-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:18):**  depending on their framework. When I started out in the 1980s, organic was like a black sheep.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:28):**  Now, there's a USDA program for organic. The food industry has widely accepted it.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:35):**  Soccer moms go to the store and buy organic produce now. I think the same thing is happening in  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:42):**  holistic health now. People can go to local health practitioners. They can get various kinds  
**[0:42:49-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:49):**  of holistic chiropractic development. They can do acupuncture, Reiki, homeopathy. Pretty common now  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:42:58):**  for people to have that kind of access to holistic health. The same kind of things happening in  
**[0:43:04-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:04):**  agriculture. Structured water is really simple. It can make some real improvements to livestock  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:12):**  health, crop health, just by energizing, restructuring the water, various other things.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:20):**  I think over time, this will be more commonly accepted. I'd say just give it a couple more decades.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:29):**  Well, there are many other pieces that we could wrap into and dive into. I'm looking forward to  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:36):**  having those conversations with you, Steve. Thank you very much for joining us here on the podcast.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:43):**  It's been an honor and a pleasure to have you here and to be able to have this conversation.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:47):**  I look forward to having more discussions. Thank you for joining us.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:51):**  Thank you for joining us. Hey, John. Thank you. It was my pleasure. Again, I look forward to  
**[0:43:58-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/bioenergetics-in-agriculture-with-steve-diver/#t=0:43:58):**  carrying on a conversation with you and your network. This podcast was brought to you by a

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:13:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:04):**  This is John Kempf and today I'm delighted to be here with Dr. David Johnson from New  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:08):**  Mexico University and also Chico State University.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:13):**  Many of you over the last few years have heard about David Johnson and his wife's work with  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:19):**  the compost bioreactors.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:21):**  I built a couple last year because I wanted some experience with them and I've heard a  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:26):**  number of really great reports from the field, from growers who have developed compost using  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:31):**  this method and have observed some very nice field results.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:35):**  So I wanted to have David here to have a conversation and to learn more about the work that he is  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:40):**  doing and the impact that it can have on all of our operations.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:44):**  David, thank you for joining us and thank you for being here for this conversation.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:48):**  Thank you very much for inviting me.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:49):**  David, the foundation of regenerative agriculture ecosystems of course is really about regenerating  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:58):**  soil health.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:00:59):**  It's about regenerating plant health and regenerating our planet's capacity to cool itself and to  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:05):**  restore water cycles and so forth.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:07):**  All of this really revolves around building organic matter, which is just a different  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:12):**  way of saying sequestering carbon dioxide.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:16):**  Actually I think the language around sequestering carbon dioxide is something that we might  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:23):**  chose to think a bit more consciously about because in reality in an agriculture ecosystem  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:28):**  we don't want to sequester carbon, we want to cycle carbon and we want to cycle large  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:33):**  volumes of carbon and of course have a large sink and a large reserve to draw from in our  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:38):**  soil profiles.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:40):**  I believe the pathway that you went down in developing your composting process was as  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:45):**  a result of desire to sequester carbon and draw down carbon.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:48):**  What have you learned about the capacity of biology to sequester carbon and to build soil  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:53):**  organic matter?  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:01:54):**  Well, first I want to say you're exactly right about the cycling of this carbon.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:00):**  It's much like our monetary system.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:01):**  If we don't have a certain velocity of money in the system, it's a dead system.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:06):**  It's the same way with carbon in the soils that you need this cycling.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:09):**  That's the energy flow in the system.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:11):**  That's what makes this work.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:13):**  And the microbes, they form this planet.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:16):**  Everything that we enjoy today has come indirectly from the microbes in the soil, the microbes  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:22):**  on this planet, how they've changed everything to make such a nice environment that we have  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:27):**  today.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:28):**  When we look at the atmosphere and the gas content, carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:33):**  from a plant's perspective, it's my understanding that plants actually like higher levels of  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:40):**  carbon dioxide because it increases their capacity for photosynthesis.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:44):**  We know that in the Earth's history, there were periods of time when there were significantly  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:49):**  higher levels of carbon dioxide, as much as 7,000 parts per million.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:52):**  Why are these higher levels of carbon dioxide perceived to be such a significant problem  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:02:59):**  from an agricultural perspective?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:00):**  Well, I think it's more from the perspective of what it does to our climate, what it does  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:05):**  to holding heat in.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:08):**  We actually see all these increases in the record heat in different areas.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:13):**  A lot of this may potentially be due to carbon dioxide.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:17):**  It may also have some influence by the atmospheric water content, the cloud formations.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:23):**  It gets very complex in a hurry, even to the point that the cloud formation is very much  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:30):**  influenced by where we are in the spiral arm of the galaxy as far as the gamma rays that  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:36):**  penetrate our atmosphere.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:38):**  They determine what type of cloud formations we have, whether we have the cumulonimbus,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:43):**  big fluffy ones, or we have high clouds.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:45):**  The cumulonimbus, they reflect the heat out, and the higher clouds, they hold the heat  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:51):**  in.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:52):**  So there's a lot of dynamics as far as that, but CO2 is a necessary nutrient.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:03:58):**  It is in a very small concentration, 400 parts per million.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:02):**  Plants do like a higher CO2 content.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:04):**  It affects a few other things on this planet.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:07):**  My understanding is that the key, if we want to support plants with carbon dioxide as a  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:12):**  nutrient and get very strong and very healthy plant growth, then of course we need that  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:19):**  carbon dioxide to cycle.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:21):**  We need to release it from the soil.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:23):**  Before we can release it from the soil, we first need to have a large reserve in the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:27):**  soil.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:28):**  I know there are many people today, well established science, if you will, is that carbon can be  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:37):**  sequestered only very slowly, that organic matter can only be built very slowly.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:42):**  And yet I know we have experience in the field where we've observed organic matter gains  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:45):**  as much as a half a percentage point per year, year after year on farms that were well managed,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:51):**  even in very low moisture environments.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:54):**  From your perspective, what you've observed so far, what is really possible with carbon  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:58):**  drawdown?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:04:59):**  How rapidly can we build organic matter?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:01):**  Well, I've seen the exact same rates that you're talking about, a half a percent increase  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:05):**  in soil carbon per year.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:07):**  In my field experiments, I've only gotten about a little over a quarter the way I've  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:12):**  been approaching this.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:13):**  I have not had the benefit of having the cattle or the grazers in my systems.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:20):**  I have been doing it solely with just the biology that I can implement in the soils.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:25):**  The animals are critical to seeing the kind of carbon increases that you're seeing, but  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:32):**  it's very possible.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:33):**  I'm not sure why other scientists have not gotten on board and looked at this a little  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:38):**  more in detail, but a half percent a year, and that's a significant amount of carbon.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:43):**  At the quarter percent, I'm talking 10 tons of carbon per hectare.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:47):**  So you're talking over 20 tons of carbon per hectare per year in soils like you're talking  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:52):**  about.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:05:54):**  Even without livestock, even at 10 tons per hectare per year, the quarter percentage point  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:02):**  of organic matter per acre per year, what are the conditions that are required in the  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:07):**  field to produce those types of results?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:10):**  What needs to be in place to achieve that kind of performance of carbon sequestration  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:14):**  and building organic matter in the soil profile?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:18):**  Basically, what I'm seeing is it's the microbial community to start with.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:23):**  This is the system that frees up the nutrients from the soil parent material.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:27):**  They cycle the carbon and the energy flow in the soils.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:31):**  They work with the plants indirectly and directly as far as exchanging nutrients for food substrates  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:40):**  and also their ability to keep the soil respiration in check.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:46):**  We see with the right microbes the potential to quintuple the above-ground net primary  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:54):**  productivity or the biomass production on that soil if you have the right microbes in  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:06:59):**  the system.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:00):**  We also see on the back end that if you have this microbial community functioning properly,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:06):**  we see a reduced respiration rate or a higher carbon use efficiency in the system.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:11):**  So you have more carbon being fixed through photosynthesis on the front end with the right  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:16):**  microbes and less CO2 respired on the back end.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:21):**  These two things start to stack together.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:23):**  That's why you can increase this soil carbon at such a fast rate.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:27):**  You have a healthy system.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:29):**  You don't have a system that's struggling to do photosynthetic processes.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:34):**  The carbon that we're putting into the soil is not an amorphous or a carbon without form  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:39):**  or shape.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:40):**  It's a carbon that has function.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:43):**  It is a microbial community that's functioning for you.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:48):**  David, you just mentioned three very big pieces that I think are important for us to unwrap  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:53):**  a bit more deeply.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:07:55):**  You mentioned having the right microbes and then increasing photosynthesis and then reducing  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:02):**  microbial respiration or increasing the efficiency of microbial respiration.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:06):**  Let's take each of those one at a time.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:09):**  When you say that soils need to have the right microbes, what defines the right microbes?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:15):**  What's the needed microbial profile or population to achieve the type of carbon sequestration  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:22):**  efficiency you're describing?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:24):**  At this point, I have to give you what I've seen.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:26):**  There's still a lot of unknown on this.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:29):**  But I think at the very beginning, what we're seeing, the conventional management processes  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:34):**  that we have used have destroyed the fungal community first, from the plowing to the biosides  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:41):**  that we apply to the bare fallows, all of this.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:45):**  The first thing that went was the fungal community.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:48):**  The fungal community is so important for logistics and communication.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:53):**  They transport nutrients down into the soil from the plant and feed the microbes, the  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:08:59):**  bacteria that are there.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:00):**  And then the bacteria, they're extracting the soil parent material, the nutrients, all  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:05):**  the elements in it that the plant needs, or fixing nitrogen for that plant.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:10):**  It's a whole system that we have to have in there.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:12):**  But the biggest thing I see in agriculture today is we've destroyed the fungal community.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:16):**  I think that's why some of the inoculum that we put on these gills does have a higher fungal  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:23):**  community.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:24):**  It has a lot of fungal spores in it, is what I'm seeing.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:27):**  And that allows you to start rebuilding a system.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:31):**  There's no one microbe that does it.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:33):**  There's no one fungi that does it.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:35):**  Nature developed everything on this planet in its systems.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:39):**  It's a system that we have to restore.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:41):**  The bacteria are just as important as the fungi for the functionality that they have  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:46):**  as far as nitrogen fixation, carbon and nitrogen cycling, phosphorus solubilization, phytohormone  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:54):**  production or hormones the microbes produce that stimulate plant growth.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:09:58):**  There's a lot of things going on in this soil.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:01):**  The entire ecosystem is very important to have functioning.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:05):**  We have soils today that don't have the fungal populations, by and large, that would be optimal.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:12):**  I know that in our consulting work and growers that we've worked with, we've observed that  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:16):**  as plant health improves and we get to a threshold point where we have plants that have a higher  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:23):**  oil content, a higher liquid content, and that also produces a soil that has a much  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:29):**  more aggressive fungal population because those lipid levels seem to really stimulate  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:35):**  the fungal community in the soil profile.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:38):**  That leads me to ask the question, what is the interplay between soil fungi and plants?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:46):**  I'm recalling a slide that you showed at some point in a presentation where you described  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:51):**  how different fungal to bacterial biomass ratios result in different levels of photosynthates  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:10:58):**  being moved around into different locations within the plant.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:00):**  Can you describe that for us a little bit?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:02):**  How do fungi affect the proportion of sugars that are moved into the soil versus that stay  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:07):**  in plant biomass?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:08):**  Well, the how part I'm still working on, but I did one experiment looking at the compost  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:13):**  that we make in this bioreactor just to look and see what its influence was on plant growth  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:18):**  as we went from a bacterial dominant system to a fungal dominant system.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:24):**  In this, we had mixed different ratios of the compost and arroyo sand here in Las Cruces.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:31):**  We noticed the partitioning of the carbon was drastically different between the different  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:37):**  treatments.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:38):**  In a bacterial dominant soil with low carbon, we only saw about 3% of the energy that planet  
**[0:11:46-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:46):**  captured as the carbon actually go into the plant, where 97% of the other energy went  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:54):**  into the soil.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:11:55):**  And for a plant to devote 97% of the energy it captures and push it into the soil, there  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:01):**  must be a reason why.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:03):**  But as we've changed from bacterial dominant to more fungal dominant through about six  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:08):**  different series, we noticed that each time we increased the fungal mass, we saw an increase  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:15):**  in the amount of carbon partitioned into the plant, either into the root or shoot or fruit  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:21):**  of that plant.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:23):**  We got up to the point where we saw 55% of that energy captured actually go into the  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:31):**  plant.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:32):**  Where we see that we are in agriculture today is we are about 11% of the total energy that  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:38):**  plant captures going into the plant.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:41):**  So we were seeing the potential to increase productivity five times.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:46):**  Once we brought this out into the field, this is exactly what we saw over about a three-year  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:51):**  period that we started to see as we were changing our soils from bacterial dominant to fungal  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:12:56):**  dominant that there was an increase in the net primary productivity of these soils.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:01):**  Okay, this is really important.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:03):**  I want to make sure that I understand this well and that our audience understands it  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:06):**  well.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:07):**  I understand you correctly, mainstream production agriculture, 11% of the photosynthetic energy  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:14):**  that the plant captures, the carbohydrates that it produces, 11% of those remain within  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:19):**  the plant and the remaining 89% on average are transmitted into the soil profile where  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:26):**  they feed bacterial populations.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:28):**  Yes, where it's trying to build it up.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:31):**  But a lot of our activities negate that.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:35):**  We're not pulling out of it, we're staying in a bacterial dominant system with a very  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:39):**  low fungal population.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:41):**  And that's part of the problem that we have in our agricultural, the conventional agricultural  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:45):**  systems where the regenerative is we can bring these back.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:50):**  And then as fungal populations increase at the upper levels, we can have the plant retaining  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:13:57):**  as much as 55% of the captured photosynthetic energy, which means only 45% is going into  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:04):**  the soil profile.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:05):**  And what does the fungal population need to look like for that to occur in terms of fungal  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:10):**  to bacterial biomass?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:11):**  Where we see the maximum productivity, the maximum carbon capture happens around a one-to-one  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:19):**  fungal to bacterial ratio.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:21):**  And it's from that point on as you're increasing it from one-to-one higher is when we start  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:28):**  to see up to about 3, 3.5 to one.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:32):**  That's where we see 55%.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:35):**  You retain maximum productivity, but it's how it's partitioned after that point.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:40):**  You're only capturing so much carbon at that point, that one-to-one fungal to bacterial  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:44):**  ratio, but it's how that carbon is distributed.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:47):**  There's more that's going into the soil at that point to still build that soil up.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:53):**  And also, a lot of this carbon is fixed to fuel the nitrogen fixation process.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:14:58):**  It's a very expensive process energetically.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:03):**  You start to see less and less energy flowing into that nitrogen fixation and then more  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:10):**  and more of that into the plant.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:12):**  You're moving up a continuum in the productivity and it's how it's funneled, whether it's funneled  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:17):**  into the plant shoot root or fruit carbon, or it's shuttled into soil carbon, or it's  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:23):**  shuttled into respiration.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:26):**  You see a definite change in respiration through this process as well.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:30):**  The respiration goes down at a linear clip.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:32):**  We'll put it that way.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:34):**  So plant respiration is also being reduced.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:36):**  And you also mentioned earlier the capacity to increase photosynthesis as well.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:41):**  Yes, soil respiration is what's dropping in this.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:44):**  It's starting to build that community up where it's starting to work effectively.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:48):**  You get all the players there.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:51):**  Everybody's at the factory that day doing the job they're supposed to do and the product  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:55):**  gets out the door.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:15:56):**  If I'm understanding you correctly, you are saying that as we have a higher fungal population,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:02):**  a higher fungal to bacterial biomass ratio, then we also have linearly less respiration  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:09):**  from the soil microbial community, which means that there is less carbon loss as carbon dioxide  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:14):**  from the soil profile as well.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:16):**  Correct.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:17):**  How much?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:18):**  Oh, I'd have to go back to the chart to make sure.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:20):**  But it's also what we're seeing in that energy that goes to nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:26):**  That's a big component of this as well.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:29):**  It's something that I observed in this experiment that at that one to one fungal to bacterial  
**[0:16:36-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:36):**  ratio and at that, I think we were at about 3% soil organic matter or 1.8 soil carbon.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:45):**  That's when we started to see the deflection in the curve where there was less and less  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:52):**  energy going into nitrogen fixation, less of the carbon going into the soil and being  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:16:57):**  respired out and more carbon going into the plant structure and the root, shoot and fruit.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:04):**  Less energy going into nitrogen fixation and into microbial respiration as a percentage,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:11):**  but perhaps still increased total in terms of actual quantity.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:16):**  This is really intriguing because I'm sitting here listening to this conversation, just  
**[0:17:21-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:21):**  doing the mental math and what you are describing is essentially that your carbon sequestration  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:31):**  rate, the quantity of carbon.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:33):**  If you move from 11% plant retained carbon to 55%, essentially what I'm envisioning happening  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:42):**  when you describe when you have increased efficiency of photosynthesis and you change  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:47):**  the carbon partitioning, it seems to me as if though you are growing more physical biomass,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:53):**  but you are also at the same time actually sequestering a lot more carbon and building  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:17:58):**  more organic matter at the same time as you're growing more crop biomass.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:02):**  Is that a correct assumption?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:05):**  I want to see this on a lot more acres.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:10):**  We all do.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:12):**  It just comes out much better for the farmer.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:14):**  We see much happier farmers when they see this in their field, when they can witness  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:19):**  it.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:20):**  It just makes farming fun again.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:22):**  What you're describing is essentially if photosynthesis changes from 11% retained within the plant  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:29):**  on average or what is common and normal today to 45% being retained within the plant, then  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:37):**  that represents almost three times, actually four times increase in the plant energy, not  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:43):**  necessarily in tonnage or total biomass because it's not all represented in biomass, but four  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:49):**  times more energy that can be harvested per acre.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:54):**  Let me just make it really simple to make sure that my thought process is working correctly.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:18:59):**  Basically this means that if your system were functioning correctly, if you had this correct  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:03):**  bacterial to fungal biomass, then that would result in increased plant biomass production  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:10):**  year after year even when you removed 100% of the crop and it would result in increased  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:17):**  nitrogen fixation year after year even when you remove 100% of the crop biomass.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:24):**  What I observed in 100% removal, there's a certain percent that has to go back.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:29):**  What I'm seeing is kind of like what you see on grain production or corn production, cotton,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:37):**  chili.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:38):**  The amount of biomass, above ground biomass that nature is going to let you have is about  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:43):**  40%.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:45):**  All of those grain crops come out about 40% of that above ground biomass.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:49):**  Cotton the same, chili the same.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:52):**  It's also what is allowed in the adaptive multipathic grazing management where you're  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:19:58):**  pulling your cattle in, you're letting them only graze 40% and you're pulling them off,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:03):**  allowing that other 60% to go back to feed these microorganisms.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:08):**  It's a very, I kind of almost got a golden ratio that nature allows.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:12):**  That's the same thing I've observed here.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:13):**  If you want to build your carbon up, there's a certain amount of this carbon that has to  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:17):**  be left to feed these organisms.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:21):**  It's that 60% that covers you use.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:24):**  You can leave them in place to cover that ground and feed those microbes.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:30):**  It's essential that they have this energy because I saw with pulling everything off,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:36):**  I did not see the carbon increase that I saw when I would leave 60% there.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:42):**  It's what you allow nature to rebuild with is how I'm seeing it right now.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:48):**  There's a key question though, I think, in what you just described is that when you removed  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:20:54):**  all of the above ground biomass, you didn't see the same degree of organic matter gain.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:02):**  But did you still see some organic matter gain, any organic matter gain?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:07):**  That pulling everything off, I did not see an increase in the data that I took.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:12):**  I continued to see over three and a half year period increase, a five times increase in  
**[0:21:17-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:17):**  that above ground biomass production, both in small plots and a large field.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:25):**  But it's how much you, if you want to build that soil carbon up from what I'm seeing,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:31):**  you have to leave a certain amount.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:32):**  That seems to weigh out at about 60%.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:35):**  That seems to be how nature developed these grasslands on the Great Plains with the bison,  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:40):**  how they would be herded by predators, kept in tight groups, moved along.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:47):**  They would deposit their dung, their saliva, the urine, and they would trample what other  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:55):**  forage had grown on that.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:21:57):**  And then it was like an inoculation event.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:00):**  The dung that they would leave would be rolled up into small balls by the dung beetles and  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:05):**  placed underground and relative composting in place.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:07):**  It was just a big inoculation event every time the bison went over these prairies.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:13):**  That's how you started to build up this deep soil carbon.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:16):**  There's a bit of a discrepancy between the 40% that is retained in crop biomass or crop  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:24):**  residue, I should say, between the broadacre crops that you mentioned and the 60% that  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:30):**  is needed for the continued organic matter gain.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:33):**  Am I understanding it correctly that there's that 20% gap?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:37):**  How can we make up that gap?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:38):**  Is that where cover crops come into play a role?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:41):**  I believe so.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:42):**  The cover crops are critical to this.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:43):**  It's not that you can bring the microbes in and they'll do it all for you.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:47):**  It's having that energy flow.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:49):**  It all comes down to energy flow, that carbon flowing into the soil from the plant to feed  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:54):**  these microorganisms.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:55):**  They will start building it up little by little.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:22:58):**  We're working with systems that are so broken photosynthetically.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:01):**  The efficiency is so low.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:03):**  That's one of the big issues.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:05):**  If you're talking about carbon sequestration, you have to fix that front end.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:09):**  You have to fix that photosynthetic rate.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:11):**  If you don't fix that front end and having that energy flow into the system, you're just  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:15):**  never really going to bring it out.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:19):**  Once you start doing that and start feeding it, these things start to stack on each other,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:23):**  stack enterprises where you're feeding the microbes, well, they're there working for  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:27):**  you.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:29):**  They're extracting the nutrients needed for that photosynthetic process to go forward  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:33):**  again.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:35):**  If you have an efficient system where your microbes are supplying everything, they're  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:39):**  supplying all the elemental nutrients that plant needs, all the nitrogen that plant needs,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:44):**  then the system builds on itself and it just becomes more and more efficient as you have  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:51):**  more photosynthesis, more microbial community development, better carbon use efficiencies.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:23:58):**  It's a living system that you're restoring in these soils.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:01):**  Much of our work at AEA has revolved around increasing a plant's capacity for photosynthesis,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:08):**  or I should say increasing the efficiency of the inherent capacity that plants already  
**[0:24:12-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:12):**  have, because as Don Huber and Michael McNeil and many others have pointed out, what we've  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:20):**  come to accept as normal is plants which are photosynthesizing somewhere in the neighborhood  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:24):**  of between 15 and 20% of their inherent photosynthetic capacity.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:29):**  Our approach to improving photosynthetic efficiency has been to manage mineral nutrition and to  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:37):**  try to improve the plant's capacity for photosynthesis within the leaves.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:42):**  Is that what you were referring to as well, or are you referring to the impact that biology  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:46):**  in the soil can have on photosynthesis?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:48):**  How does that work?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:50):**  It's not just the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that we had.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:53):**  There's so many elements.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:56):**  These systems use almost every element on the periodic table.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:24:59):**  There's no way that we can forecast what that plant is going to need.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:04):**  That's why nature developed this system where the microbes and the plant work together.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:08):**  I mean, there's a lot of molybdenum used in nitrogen fixation, selenium also as far as  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:15):**  the plant health.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:16):**  There's just so many micronutrients that are involved in the photosynthetic process in  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:23):**  the structure of those proteins and the cofactors, the elemental cofactors in these proteins  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:29):**  for them to function properly.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:31):**  We have trouble enough with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium figuring out what the right  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:35):**  amount is to get out there.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:37):**  Not putting too much and not putting enough.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:41):**  It's hard to envision that we'll ever be able to have everything there on time the way nature  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:50):**  can when she has the right biology.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:52):**  You are absolutely correct.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:25:54):**  One of the trace minerals that is worth mentioning and that I often speak about is manganese,  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:00):**  because for photosynthesis to happen, the first step in the process with regards to  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:07):**  water is for the water molecule to be split in water hydrolysis to H and OH.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:12):**  That process is completely dependent on manganese.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:15):**  That means you can have the perfect amount of water and sunlight and chlorophyll and  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:21):**  carbon dioxide, but if you don't have enough manganese, photosynthesis is not going to  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:26):**  happen.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:27):**  The whole system shuts down.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:29):**  You lose that efficiency.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:30):**  What are the tools that you use to improve photosynthetic efficiency?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:35):**  What is the approach that you advise chlorophytes to take to improve photosynthetic efficiency?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:39):**  Well, it's the microbes.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:42):**  It's having this compost that when we put it out as a inocular, we're seeing over 2,500  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:47):**  species of bacteria, 400 species of fungi, another host of archaea, which is the ancient  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:55):**  bacteria that developed this planet.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:26:57):**  Photosynthesis as well, every organism like us, we depend on all of these organisms for  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:05):**  our functioning as a living entity.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:10):**  If we don't have the bacterial component we need or the fungal component, the viral component,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:16):**  we don't function well as humans.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:18):**  These soils are exactly the same.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:21):**  If they don't have that full complement of biology, things go awry.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:26):**  We see that in human health right now.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:30):**  We're so influenced by our stomach microbiota that just a simple disturbance or dysbiosis  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:40):**  of that community can affect our health dramatically.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:44):**  Yet they're finding when you bring a microbial community from a healthy donor back into somebody  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:50):**  with problems like Crohn's disease or IBS, we see that these people can, you know, they've  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:27:57):**  suffered for decades with these diseases and yet when you come in with the right biology,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:02):**  they can be healed within 24 hours.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:04):**  It's amazing to have the right biology there and it's not a single microbe.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:09):**  It's a whole community structure that we're bringing back.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:12):**  We're seeing the things that we can cure now with restoration of that stomach microbiota.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:18):**  We're seeing things like autism, things that we thought were genetic diseases, diabetes.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:25):**  There's just a whole host of diseases that we suffer because we've disrupted that community  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:32):**  structure, that microbial community structure and our gut microbiota.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:36):**  And we've done the same thing in agriculture.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:39):**  And I think that's why we're seeing that as you come in with inoculating these soils with  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:44):**  these microbes, you see such dramatic differences.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:48):**  We did a trial in Wilcox this last summer with corn.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:28:54):**  Looking at 256 pounds of nitrogen per acre in our control, we dropped that by 85% down  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:01):**  to 15%, about 37 pounds of nitrogen per acre.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:07):**  And we brought in two pounds of the compost per acre in an inocula that we would inject  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:14):**  into the furrow when we planted.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:17):**  And then we also did just the biology only, just that two pound rate of the compost per  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:22):**  acre.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:23):**  We matched productivity at 218 bushels an acre on the corn with the conventional with  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:28):**  the 85% reduction.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:32):**  And we only lost 6.6% productivity on just the biology alone.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:38):**  And this was our first year in this field.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:41):**  We only had about 40 pounds of nitrogen per acre available.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:47):**  But the biology in this systems, that 170 pounds of nitrogen came from somewhere because  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:29:56):**  we pulled off about 261 units of nitrogen off that field.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:02):**  The nitrogen was there, was absorbed from the atmosphere.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:04):**  You just didn't buy it.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:06):**  That's the key piece is that you didn't buy the nitrogen that was added.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:09):**  There was $80 more an acre profit for the farmer.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:13):**  The inocula cost him about 50 cents an acre.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:16):**  In essence, what you're describing, I think this conversation about the capacity for nitrogen  
**[0:30:20-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:20):**  fixation and the 37,000 tons of nitrogen that's above every acre is not a new conversation  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:29):**  for growers anymore.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:30):**  Realizing it and actually getting it to work in the field is something that isn't that  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:35):**  commonly experienced, although it's becoming much more common.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:39):**  But I also want to go back, not just to focus on nitrogen, but on all these other minerals.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:44):**  We spoke a bit about manganese.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:45):**  You mentioned that there's all the elements on the periodic table that will eventually  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:50):**  discover a need for within these plant enzyme systems.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:30:55):**  When I asked the question about how do we increase photosynthetic efficiency, your answer  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:00):**  was we need to get better biology.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:03):**  If I'm understanding you correctly, if I'm connecting the dots correctly, what you're  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:07):**  really saying is that when we have better biology in the soil, they have the capacity  
**[0:31:13-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:13):**  to release nutrients, the nutrients that the crop needs when it needs them in order to  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:20):**  increase the photosynthetic efficiency.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:22):**  That's how we're getting photosynthetic efficiency is by having the biology to deliver nutrition  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:26):**  when needed.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:27):**  That's how I see it now with the research I've done.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:30):**  It's self-assembling, it seems, from what we've observed that these decisions are made  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:36):**  for you if you have the right microbial community in your farming system.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:43):**  It makes farming a lot easier.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:44):**  That's why I'm saying I see a lot happier farmers.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:48):**  They don't have to think, well, did I put enough of this or did I not have enough of  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:51):**  that?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:52):**  As they improve this biology, this gets to be a very forgiving system, a very resilient  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:31:58):**  system, a system that can almost fix itself as to what it needs.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:03):**  I think it's very important for us as we consider developing agricultural systems for the future,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:09):**  we need to develop systems that are resilient to vagaries of the weather.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:17):**  Here in Northeast Ohio, we've had eight days where it's snowed in late April, mid to late  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:22):**  April.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:23):**  We see these increasing weather inconsistencies and, of course, managing water and water use  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:29):**  efficiency is a really big deal.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:31):**  We've observed many cases where soils become more biologically active and it seems that  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:38):**  water no longer behaves the same as it has in the past, or perhaps I should say the crops'  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:43):**  water use efficiency changes where all of a sudden it seems that an inch of rainfall  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:47):**  goes much further than it has in the past.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:50):**  What have you observed with water use efficiency?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:53):**  Watching the same thing as you improve that photosynthetic capacity or the efficiency,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:32:59):**  you're using that water more efficiently.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:00):**  You're getting more crop for the amount of water you're putting out there on the front  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:06):**  end.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:07):**  On the back end, you're changing the dynamics of that soil, how that water can infiltrate  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:12):**  in the first place.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:13):**  The soil that we started with at Wilcox, it took 10 minutes for one inch of water to infiltrate  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:20):**  into that soil.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:22):**  It was very compacted, but we're seeing as we bring this biology back, as they improve  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:28):**  the tilt of the soil, they build their micro aggregates and this whole system starts to  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:35):**  completely change.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:36):**  The water infiltration goes in faster.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:39):**  You're talking seconds for one inch of water to get into the soil.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:44):**  The retention of that water, in our part of the country, we have very sandy soils.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:47):**  That water just goes straight through.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:49):**  It is not held in that upper profile where the root is.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:53):**  Yet, once you have the biology there with the carbon buildup, that water, we see the  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:33:59):**  first 1% increase in soil carbon, a five times increase in the amount of water that soil  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:05):**  can hold in that top foot.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:07):**  How important is that for you and your crop that you can hold that water instead of losing  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:13):**  it?  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:14):**  That's where all this efficiency comes from.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:15):**  We pretty much destroyed any water retention capacity of these soils from our application  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:20):**  to the fertilizers and our consistent tilling.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:24):**  It's bringing the covers back in, bringing the biology back in.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:29):**  They bring the carbon in.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:30):**  The carbon changes the whole dynamic of how these soils work.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:36):**  You've got nothing to lose by starting to look at agriculture this way.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:41):**  It will be the agricultural future because the way we're farming land right now, the  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:46):**  amount of land that we have left is depleting, is declining dramatically for the number of  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:52):**  people and water as well.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:54):**  We see people on the western or the eastern side of New Mexico, the Ogallala aquifer,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:34:59):**  they've got six years to fix this.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:02):**  Then, they'll be dry land farmers because the Ogallala has decreased that much in that  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:08):**  area.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:09):**  There's big issues that need to be fixed, but every one of them can be fixed by bringing  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:13):**  the biology back and having a significant amount of that carbon go back into the soil  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:19):**  to start building that community structure of both the microbial community, the soil  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:24):**  carbon and the plant itself.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:27):**  How much can water use efficiency be increased?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:30):**  How far can we make a gallon of water go?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:32):**  I've seen a doubling of crop productivity in our area from the norm just by bringing  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:39):**  this system back up and functioning.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:42):**  You can farm half the land and still get the same amount of crop doing this.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:47):**  It's significant when we see that agriculture uses 70 to 80 percent of the fresh water on  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:53):**  this planet.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:54):**  It's because we're doing it so poorly.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:35:56):**  We have such inefficient, broken systems that it's that way.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:00):**  It doesn't need to be that way.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:02):**  We can farm smarter.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:03):**  David, as you've been on this pathway developing this different composting methodology and  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:10):**  looking at the results that it produces in the fields, what has been something that surprised  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:15):**  you?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:16):**  What was unexpected?  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:17):**  All of this.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:18):**  I didn't go in looking for this.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:23):**  My research, I was actually just trying to find a way to compost dairy manure and have  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:29):**  a decent product because it was so saline, the dairy manure that you started with and  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:34):**  the end product.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:35):**  The rest of this has been serendipity.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:37):**  It has just been side roads, observations that shouldn't be happening.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:43):**  And yet, you would follow that side road and it would just keep going to another side road.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:48):**  That's how we discovered this.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:50):**  It's not because we're brilliant.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:52):**  It's because we're lucky.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:56):**  I think that's true of all people who pay attention.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:36:59):**  And unfortunately.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:00):**  Yeah, 97 percent of the great discoveries are serendipity, just accidental.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:08):**  But it's good timing.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:10):**  It seems to be a path forward when what we're seeing now in agriculture is so many brick  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:17):**  walls that these farmers are running into.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:21):**  We hear, we get the letters from people and you could just feel the pain.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:28):**  And yet, to have this as a potential to fix these problems and allow them to become profitable  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:36):**  again and have farming, as I say, fun again instead of what it is right now, I think this  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:43):**  is a good time.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:45):**  In that case, it's never been better that we know we have a path out of this.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:50):**  David, with the interactions you've had, you've gotten to observe some of the challenges of  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:56):**  mainstream agriculture.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:37:58):**  With the perspective that you have gained, what do you believe to be true about modern  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:02):**  agriculture that is different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:05):**  That's a tough one.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:06):**  You know that cartoon back in the 60s, Pogo?  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:12):**  We have met the enemy and he is us.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:17):**  We are our biggest obstacle.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:20):**  It's our insistence on holding on to traditional methodologies.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:27):**  It's the change that needs to be made is we need to start observing, open up to alternate  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:35):**  ideas.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:36):**  That's going to be the farming in the future because this is all about observation.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:40):**  This is the good start.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:42):**  It's like that adaptive multipathic grazing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:44):**  The adaptive part is the most important part because you're never going to get the same  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:49):**  thing twice.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:50):**  What was it?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:52):**  One person said that went up to a farmer.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:54):**  The farmer said he'd been farming about 40 years.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:38:56):**  The guy said, wow, you've got 40 years experience.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:00):**  He said, no, I've got 40 experiences.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:04):**  That's what you're going to get in farming.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:06):**  You'll probably never figure this out completely, but observation is key.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:11):**  Just simple things.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:12):**  I think one farmer we knew, they were out just disking the corners of a circle.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:18):**  His dad cut across the field to get to the other corner.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:23):**  They noticed in their corn production the exact path that his dad took across that field.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:28):**  They would drop 100 bushels an acre every time they went across it.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:33):**  Disturbance is a big problem in agriculture.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:36):**  The less we can do, the better off we're going to be.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:40):**  What is a book or a resource that you would recommend to growers and agronomists?  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:44):**  Oh, gosh.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:48):**  There's a lot of good ones coming out, but what they have right now that's best is like  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:53):**  the blogs that you have where they can come in and watch what you have to say or go to  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:39:59):**  Chico, go to their center for regenerative ag.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:01):**  They have a whole bunch of people that are talking about this.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:05):**  We're not caught up to this in science yet.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:08):**  The mainstream science in the universities is still in the old paradigm where there's  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:15):**  a few places at a few universities that are getting it.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:18):**  Chico is one of them.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:19):**  You get more up-to-date knowledge.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:22):**  I think the blogs like you have on your site are very helpful.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:26):**  Gabe Brown, what he does.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:28):**  Ray Archuleta, what he does.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:30):**  Allen Williams, what he does.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:31):**  Will Harris in Georgia, what he does.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:35):**  All of these, this is how you're going to get the most up-to-date information.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:39):**  I don't know.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:40):**  I'd rather sit and watch a blog than read a book sometimes.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:43):**  I get too much reading as it is.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:46):**  David, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:51):**  If you had a piece of advice for people in general, what is something that a recommendation  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:55):**  that you would make for them?  
**[0:40:57-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:40:57):**  Consider biology, how it shaped this planet and what it has overcome and start to look  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:09):**  at your soils as a biological, as a living organism.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:15):**  Treat that organism like you would a child.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:17):**  You know, if that child is thirsty, if that child needs food, you're going to be there.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:22):**  It's not an inanimate object.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:24):**  It's not a sponge anymore.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:27):**  But I would also reiterate observation.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:30):**  It's the observation that's going to get you out of this predicament that you're in.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:35):**  It's the moving away from the conventional and traditional agriculture into an agriculture  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:40):**  that's regenerative.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:42):**  That's actually start to rebuild your soils.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:44):**  It's rebuilding your soils for your future progeny.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:48):**  The children that you have, having something there that you can give them in the future.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:54):**  It's building that soil up, which is something that we can do.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:41:57):**  There's enough people doing this.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:00):**  There's no doubt we can do it.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:01):**  I mean, I've seen one rancher in just south of us here in the Chihuahuan Desert change  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:08):**  a desert setting to a grasslands in a decade just by grazing management.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:15):**  We've seen farmers do the same thing with the way they're approaching agriculture in  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:20):**  a regenerative approach.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:22):**  It completely is possible.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:25):**  You just have to get out and observe it.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:27):**  As I say, it does make farming fun again.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:29):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:30):**  David, thank you very much for sharing your wisdom and insights, the observations and  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:36):**  experiences that you've had.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:38):**  Thank you for the opportunity as well.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:40):**  You're very welcome.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/microbial-communities-for-carbon-sequestration-with-david-johnson/#t=0:42:41):**  I think your knowledge is something that needs to become much more widely adopted and used

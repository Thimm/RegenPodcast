**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:06):**  agricultural systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:28):**  agricultural systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:31):**  And from my side, things that I have learned from my fellow farmers, they have been teaching me  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:37):**  quite a bit of things that I speak and I just link the technicality I learned from academia  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:44):**  and put that in the practical hands of the farm. Sylvia, I think you have a fascinating background.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:50):**  You've done some very interesting work and particularly professionally in the dairy  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:54):**  nutrition work that you've done. Can you tell us a little bit about your background and what has  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:02:58):**  brought you to where you are today and some of the things that you're working on today?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:02):**  Sure. Well, you hear my accent. I live in Illinois, but I actually am originally from  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:09):**  the Caribbean, the island of the Dominican Republic. And I came to this country several  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:16):**  years ago. I'm not going to count exactly, so people will not start to detect my age,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:22):**  but definitely has been quite a while since I came to quote, quote, learn how to  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:28):**  do dairy nutrition. So after finishing veterinary school, I was awarded with a scholarship to come  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:35):**  and focus on the things that I like the most, which is relating health and nutrition.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:42):**  So I focused on nutrition for two years at the University of Tennessee. And this is where  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:49):**  I actually learned how to do the nutrition that is practiced here in the United States,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:03:55):**  conventional dairy nutrition, where you maximize the milk production of a dairy cow  
**[0:04:01-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:01):**  based on the inputs that will take to get the energy that she calls from their genetic potential.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:09):**  And that was quite interesting. I learned many things, but at the same time, I was very  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:15):**  caution about how this nutrition was challenging some of the principles that I have learned  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:22):**  on focus on the health of the animal first. And also very grateful because I was able to  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:29):**  focus a little bit more on my preparation on milk fatty acid profile at the University of Nebraska.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:35):**  So those knowledge were very important in my formation, but I think that the pivot point  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:41):**  for me to really change the principles that I was practicing in my career was the point when  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:48):**  I had my kids and realized that I wanted to focus on improving the immune system by focusing  
**[0:04:56-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:04:56):**  on nutrition. And that was a pivot point. I found myself reaching for organic fruits to prepare  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:04):**  their meals and selecting eggs and dairy products that were produced using the organic standards.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:11):**  So I realized that after the readings and research that I was doing that I needed to focus on  
**[0:05:20-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:20):**  a holistic way to growing pastures, harvest by the animals, and integrating the soil health  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:30):**  into the whole approach of dairy farming. And this is when I realized that, well, if I decide to come  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:37):**  back to my career and work as a veterinarian and as a nutritionist, I think I'm going to focus  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:43):**  to serve the farmers that are doing the extra work for me to be able to have products that  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:50):**  I'm happy to pay the extra money so my kids can enjoy the benefit of that. And that's when I think  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:05:58):**  things turn around for me. I decided to really focus on holistic, sustainable, pasture-based,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:05):**  organic dairy production. And so this is what I'm doing today. I found the great opportunity  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:12):**  to practice that by serving organic value through the nutrition and the health aspect of the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:21):**  consulting. You mentioned a very key phrase a few moments ago, which was developing immunity with  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:28):**  nutrition. Of course, this is something that I personally am very passionate about. And there are  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:36):**  some individual bits and pieces that are scattered around the world in the literature talking about  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:42):**  the correlation between nutrition and immunity. But there's still a lot of question marks around  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:50):**  the very simple question, can immunity of dairy cows or people or plants be increased  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:06:57):**  with nutrition? How would you respond to that? Yes, the short answer for that is yes.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:04):**  There is definitely research confirming the fact that when nutrition is balanced and is provided  
**[0:07:15-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:15):**  at the level of the species that you are selecting to work with, the immunity based on the kind of  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:26):**  cells and the kind of nutrition that needs to be improved has a direct correlation. And it's all  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:35):**  linked, I think, in the way that we see how organs and system work and relate to one another in a  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:45):**  human or in an animal. In either cases, and I can see that that can be further down into the plant  
**[0:07:53-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:07:53):**  into the plant kingdom too. Whenever you are able to provide the key ingredients that a system or an  
**[0:08:02-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:02):**  organ needs, there is no other way but improving the health. For instance, if the digestive system  
**[0:08:11-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:11):**  is provided with the nutrients that are needed in the proportion and in the form that it needs  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:20):**  to be absorbed, the animal, the entity that you are putting the nutrition on will have no other  
**[0:08:27-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:27):**  choice but provide the ingredients that the cells need to thrive, to reproduce, and to sustain that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:36):**  Of course, when we deviate from that balance and from that original design for each species,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:44):**  then we encounter with each. But I think the link is there. And we have already information that  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:08:52):**  links how minerals, for instance, are transferred from one point to another and yield in the better  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:00):**  formation of the cells, better formation of tissues, and that also have implications on  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:07):**  the organ that is serving. So, it is from the nutrition to the cellular level that we can say,  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:14):**  yes, there is a direct connection in health and nutrition.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:20):**  When you describe your own personal journey and having children and desiring for them to have  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:27):**  good nutrition to support their own immune systems, to some degree, that comment or that statement is  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:33):**  an indictment of commercial food production where you're implying that some of our commercial  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:39):**  agricultural practices may, in fact, not be providing the nutrition that we would desire.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:45):**  So, I guess the question that I have is, what were some of the memorable moments in your life  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:51):**  that led you to the realization that you really want to help produce healthier, higher quality  
**[0:09:56-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:09:56):**  food? Well, I think I can think of two events. One was my surprise on how plastic, how responsive  
**[0:10:09-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:09):**  is the immune system of our food producing animals. I have seen and witnessed how an animal  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:17):**  can get sick, very sick, by feeding their own diet. And yet, when you apply the changes and you  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:27):**  change the proportion of nutrients, you don't offend some system by overfeeding some things.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:35):**  You know, it takes sometimes just weeks for an animal to start showing the signs of recovery.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:44):**  And I was amazed by that because I thought, once we have abused the system, and in many cases,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:50):**  you know, underfeeding and overfeeding some things, I thought, well, the animals are not going  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:10:55):**  to recover. I mean, this is a lost cause. But over and over, I have been proven wrong. Basically, when  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:03):**  you see how feeding an animal, a ruminant animal in this case, a ration that is exactly what was  
**[0:11:11-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:11):**  designed to be digested, the animal respond in a way that first things, the manure changes, the skin,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:21):**  the coat changes, the alertness of the animal change, and all because you started to provide  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:29):**  the animal with the nutrients it needs. So, it is encouraging to know that if that is the case,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:37):**  if an animal that has been underfed or overfed in some nutrients can change and actually start  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:44):**  to show signs of healthy immune system and healthy digestion, healthy well-being,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:51):**  then we should focus on making transformation in this agriculture system. It is not a loss.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:11:59):**  Animals, once you feed them properly, they are able to respond very well and get sick with fewer  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:08):**  events. Animals that have been fed from conventional diets and are focused on  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:14):**  pasture and grass, they change completely. The metabolic diseases are less of an issue  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:22):**  until it becomes to the point that the longevity of the animal is the result of consistently  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:30):**  nutrition that provides the elements that the cow needs to produce, to sustain, and to reproduce.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:39):**  That is very encouraging and very exciting. And we have actually observed the same with plants.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:44):**  It's very encouraging to observe the extraordinary resilience and the ability to recover from  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:51):**  sometimes very challenging abuse, environmental and climactic and nutritional abuse, essentially.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:12:59):**  It is amazing to see how quickly they can recover. But you mentioned that there were two pieces that  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:03):**  surprised you that were very encouraging. What was the second piece? That's right. The second piece  
**[0:13:07-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:07):**  was to see the results of the focus of nutrition in my own kids. And so, here was trying to focus  
**[0:13:17-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:17):**  on feeding the best I can my kids and compare that to what most of my friends around me were doing,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:26):**  realizing that focusing on nutrition might take a little bit more time and a little bit more  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:33):**  thinking behind what you're going to put in front of them. Yet, I was surprised to see how even  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:41):**  living in this toxic environment that we are surrounded with air and water and pollution,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:49):**  yet you focus on the basic of good nutrition, food as grown and put it in a way that is attractive  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:13:57):**  and enjoyable. The kids actually like it. They learn how to enjoy good flavor. And my surprise  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:04):**  was how much of a difference it made in terms of the number of diseases and ailments that I saw in  
**[0:14:11-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:11):**  my own kids compared to my other friends' kids. Very rarely my kids got sick. And many times they  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:19):**  say that they actually wanted to get sick so they can skip school. So, it was quite amazing to see  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:27):**  that we cannot change everything around us. We cannot make it perfect. But yet, if you focus on  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:34):**  few basic things like nutrition and exercise, both in the animal kingdom and in the humans,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:43):**  I am definitely saying, yes, things can be improved and you should be encouraged to make  
**[0:14:49-0:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:49):**  changes because it does affect in a positive way. Sylvia, I'd love to hear from your perspective.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:14:57):**  When you work with dairy farmers and you're working with dairy cows to change diets,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:02):**  nutritional protocols, and so forth, when you think of an ideal, an attritional ideal,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:07):**  what is the goal that you strive for? And can you paint an image with words, if you will, of  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:13):**  what does a really exceptionally healthy dairy farm look like? What have you experienced and  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:18):**  observed that you found to be delightful? Well, I think I have found common elements  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:26):**  in most of the successful dairy farms that I have visited so far. And with that, I will include some  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:33):**  of the farms that I visit outside of the country, people that are doing dairy farming in a holistic  
**[0:15:40-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:40):**  way. And a couple of key things are common in them. Number one is that they focus on a balanced  
**[0:15:49-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:49):**  nutrition, depending on the season of the year. And by that, I mean, if it is grazing season,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:15:59):**  this is what occupies the most of their time. And I know this is not going to be good things  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:06):**  in the ears of some of the farmers that are focused on cropping, but the reality is when  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:13):**  it's grazing time, the management of that grass should be the number one occupation. And they have  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:20):**  that common thread. They inspect their pasture, they know ahead of time where their cows are going  
**[0:16:27-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:27):**  and for how long. And so I have seen successful dairy farmers just taking a walk before they let  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:36):**  the cows out and making sure that they know how much is out there and how long they should be. So  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:43):**  they focus on nutrition depending on the season. When it's non-grazing season, definitely they make  
**[0:16:49-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:49):**  sure that they know where the right good feed is and what kind of animals need to have this feed.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:16:58):**  So they go their nutrition by the season. Number two, I've found that successful farmers  
**[0:17:05-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:05):**  have a special eye and nose and I'll say ear for cow conflict. They know when their cows are  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:14):**  outside of their comfort zone in interpreter and they have planned already ways to mitigate that.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:22):**  And that's extremely important because a cow that is comfortable, those content cows that we hear  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:28):**  about, they actually have a better way to digest their feed and their nervous system is not  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:34):**  stressed, it's not challenged. And milk production is based on a mammary gland, a gland that it is  
**[0:17:42-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:42):**  responding to nerves and blood circulation and nutrition. So when you take care of that comfort  
**[0:17:52-0:18:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:17:52):**  and that animal wellbeing, she responds positively to that. And lastly, I think the common thread  
**[0:18:00-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:00):**  also is making sure that they are working their nutrition based on their land and working with the  
**[0:18:08-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:08):**  soil that they were either blessed or cursed. So that focus on taking the most they can,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:19):**  taking care. The more knowledge they get, the more they practice on. So if they find out that  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:27):**  the soil is lacking in certain nutrients because this is just the geography and the topography  
**[0:18:34-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:34):**  they have, they work their way around that. They focus on what is limiting based on the land that  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:43):**  they have. They don't try to apply things that are supposed to be used in the Netherlands or in  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:51):**  New Zealand. And if they are in California, they don't apply things that work in Maine. So they  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:18:58):**  focus on what is it that is challenging in my ecosystem and they target that.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:05):**  Sylvia, with all the various operations that you've observed and the experiences that you've had,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:11):**  what is something that you believe to be true about modern agriculture that is very different  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:17):**  from the mainstream view? And in that case, you mean different from conventional agriculture  
**[0:19:25-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:25):**  compared to a holistic, sustainable agriculture? You could say that. However, you chose to answer  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:33):**  the question. We have a very large mainstream agriculture and I've observed that there are many  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:40):**  very wise people who have observed some of the challenges of that system and how they might be  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:48):**  overcome. And I would love to hear your perspective. And what is currently within the  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:52):**  mainstream that is accepted as being true that you think might in fact not be true?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:19:58):**  I think the assumption that when you take care of few nutrients, but you ignore them,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:10):**  you ignore or make the assumption that all the nutrients will follow along. I think that's  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:20):**  a mistake. It's an assumption that we have seen the results in a negative way.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:29):**  In mainstream agriculture, it is believed that if you take care of the big things that are  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:37):**  in need for growing crops or raising animals, for instance, if you take care of the nitrogen  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:46):**  and the fossils, somehow the rest of the minerals, for instance, will follow along in the right  
**[0:20:52-0:21:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:20:52):**  balance. That is not true. And we have seen lower levels of basic antioxidant nutrients,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:21:03):**  vitamins, and trace minerals that have been lacking in our food. And it's a direct result of  
**[0:21:11-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:21:11):**  underestimating how important it is to take care of things that are beyond nitrogen and phosphorus

**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:21:27):**  talking about molybdenum and selenium and some other minerals, zinc and manganese, and how they

**[0:21:59-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:21:59):**  that does not protect the nutrients, at least to stay longer than we think they should be,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:22:08):**  we end up with animals being fed, feeds that are deprived of the basic things, the sugars and the  
**[0:22:16-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:22:16):**  vitamins, and in terms of the people being fed foods that are broken down in individual nutrients,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:22:27):**  feeding only the starch or only the protein and separating the basic elements. Food for people

**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:01):**  what things we want to focus on. And we have been proven wrong. The levels of diseases we have  
**[0:23:08-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:08):**  in animals and people today is a reflection of how wrong we were at manipulating foods and things.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:17):**  To the first point that you mentioned, the awareness that just addressing the  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:22):**  major nutrients is not enough, but we also need to address trace minerals and some of the key  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:29):**  enzyme, co-packers that are needed. I think this is something that has definitely gained,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:35):**  from my perspective at least, it's gained a tremendous amount of awareness just in the last  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:39):**  four to five years even. This has been true both in the fruit and vegetable production world,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:43):**  as well as in forage crops and broadacre commodity crops as well. One of the pieces that has been so  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:49):**  intriguing for me in the work that we do at AEA is there's this list of six standard trace minerals,  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:23:55):**  iron, zinc, manganese, copper, boron, that are very well recognized. But then there are also  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:03):**  some of the trace minerals which you mentioned such as selenium and molybdenum and cobalt.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:08):**  And speaking purely for myself, I've been surprised, amazed actually, at the yield  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:15):**  responses and quality responses we sometimes get from these very small trace minerals.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:20):**  When other things are in balance and sometimes when we apply very small amounts of molybdenum  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:28):**  or cobalt per acre, we get a tremendous yield response from crops as well as a quality response.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:24:36):**  That's right. That's right. And I can cite several papers that have been published for the last

**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:25:38):**  vitamin E, for instance, vitamin A, early on in the development of the calf, we actually make that

**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:25:56):**  the milk, we see that the lack of presence of some of these vitamins and trace minerals

**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:26:18):**  grazing, even if it's not organic, but I provide an actual phosphorus and grazing to the animals,

**[0:26:32-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:26:32):**  in live foods and feeds make a huge impact in the health in the immune system of the animal.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:26:41):**  You mentioned something that really caught my attention, which was the idea that we can change  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:26:47):**  a plant's nutritional profile, the amino acid profile, carbohydrate profile, and so forth,

**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:26:58):**  insect susceptibility. What are the implications of that for forage quality and dairy nutrition?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:27:05):**  Well, it's huge because going back to the way the animal feed is manufactured, it is based on  
**[0:27:13-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:27:13):**  photosynthesis and the ability of the plant to form complete proteins and complete carbohydrates.

**[0:27:30-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:27:30):**  just carbon attached to a nitrogen and making it a lone molecule. There is actually the presence of  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:27:38):**  some key minerals that form proteins and carbohydrates that are in a structure in a way  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:27:47):**  that when eaten by the animal is able to be digested and provide nutrition for their bacteria.

**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:28:23):**  with a plant material with a high levels of nitrate because the formation of the protein,

**[0:29:47-0:29:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:29:47):**  attrition in a dairy diet will result in having both a negative effect in limiting  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:29:56):**  the rumen bacterial population from developing as it might and also from allowing incomplete

**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:31:34):**  your perspective and your thoughts. I know you work with many of these farmers as well.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:31:38):**  What is needed to produce a high fat content forage and why is that valuable or useful?

**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:32:42):**  at being digested, more than 55 to 60% of the components being actually digestible by the  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:32:49):**  bacteria, they are the ones that provide these key ingredients for making butter fat. In the

**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:33:33):**  going to feed more fiber because this is what will produce that. Well in reality, if they are  
**[0:33:39-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:33:39):**  lignified, bacteria have no access to that port. So plants have cells that are guarded by a cell  
**[0:33:48-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:33:48):**  wall. If the plant material is too mature, actually the bacteria will not be able to break through  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:33:56):**  that and digest the hemicellulose and cellulose and the pectins that are inside the cell wall.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:04):**  So first of all, good quality fiber coming from a mix of grasses and legumes is the key for  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:13):**  increasing the milk components because again those ingredients for the mammary gland to make  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:19):**  the butter fat come from the digestion of fiber. They should be balanced though with the right  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:26):**  amount of nitrogen compounds because if the bacteria only have carbon sources but don't

**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:46):**  short amount of time that they have during the day. So it is a balance of digestible fiber,  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:34:54):**  a balance of the right level of protein, not too much but not too little and ideally for a dairy  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:00):**  cow between six and a half and seventeen percent of what she consumes should be in the form of  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:07):**  protein. And if we are counting grams or ounces or pounds, a cow should have at least six pounds  
**[0:35:14-0:35:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:14):**  of protein combined with 12 pounds of fiber, what we call effective fiber and that you know fairly  
**[0:35:23-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:23):**  quickly is a good ration for making components, both butter fat and protein. So I'm intrigued,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:32):**  I'm hearing what you're describing around the protein and fiber needs and the balance that is  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:39):**  required and I'm intrigued by this entire conversation that has been happening over the last  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:44):**  several years about fat content in forages where farmers are expressing a desire to have a higher  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:51):**  fat content with the belief that that may lead to higher components and based on what you're  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:35:57):**  describing that isn't necessarily the case. And so the question that I would have is what really are  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:02):**  the benefits of having a higher fat content forage? Well having a high fat content in the  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:09):**  forages is important and everything under the right balance of course because the total ration  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:14):**  of a dairy cow if it has more than five percent fat, so we are putting percentage but we can  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:22):**  always go back and calculate how many grams or ounces does that represent. Well we know that  
**[0:36:30-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:30):**  the manufacturing of nutrients in a plant, it is basically focused on the link of carbons,  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:39):**  hydrogens and oxygen to form carbohydrates, then the link of nitrogens with carbon to form  
**[0:36:46-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:46):**  proteins and also the link of carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen compounds to make fat.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:36:55):**  But a plant put that all into proportion. Unless it is an oil seed and in the development of the seed  
**[0:37:04-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:04):**  head, the plant has a certain maximum amount of fatty acid that can pour into these stems  
**[0:37:12-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:12):**  and leaves before it turns into another species. So for grasses and legumes, if we maximize the  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:20):**  production of fat, that also means that the plant itself has what it takes to make good  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:26):**  carbohydrates because she will only turn things into fat when she has a surplus of nutrients.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:34):**  So when we target higher fat, we are targeting the higher proportion of carbohydrates  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:42):**  and higher proportion of protein. It's like an indication that things are going right in the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:49):**  plant system, but we know also that the fatty acids that are present in an immature plant  
**[0:37:57-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:37:57):**  particularly have an effect on the way the rumen environment is responding. So in the beginning of  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:07):**  the season and the grazing season, we have young plants with high fat content because this is the  
**[0:38:12-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:12):**  way the plant is manufacturing things, reserving to elongate some carbohydrates. So we as farmers  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:20):**  need to manage this grazing because in this stage of the growth of the plant, the actual digestion  
**[0:38:28-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:28):**  of those fatty acids will turn into conjugation of fatty acids that will result in compounds  
**[0:38:36-0:38:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:36):**  that will trigger a negative response in the mammary gland. But that only happens when the  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:45):**  plant is immature because the proportion of these nutrients, carbohydrates, protein, and fat, are not  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:52):**  in the ideal proportion for ruminants. They might be good for other animals, but for ruminants, we  
**[0:38:59-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:38:59):**  want to have structures that are a little bit more complex, fiber that actually can induce rumination,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:09):**  and particles that are just long enough not to let that rumen passage go too fast. And we as farmers  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:17):**  then, we manage the plants and we manage the animals. We let the plant do what they are doing,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:25):**  but we put the animals when that plant material has the proportion of nutrients in the way that  
**[0:39:32-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:32):**  will be best for the cow. That's why we are calling for grazing a little bit taller, is to allow that  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:40):**  plant to continue to develop until it has that proportion of fatty acids and that proportion of  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:48):**  complex carbohydrates and the proportion of complete protein in a way that is actually favorable  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:39:56):**  for the ruminant animal. So if you were looking at a forage on a forage analysis and trying to  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:02):**  evaluate those three things, what are the parameters that you would be looking for and what does an  
**[0:40:08-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:08):**  ideal forage look like to you on a forage analysis? The ideal analysis will show fiber digestibility  
**[0:40:18-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:18):**  above 55% and non-fiber carbohydrates above 28%, a lignin that is below four and a half percent,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:32):**  but not too little. I want some lignin just to make sure that again the rumination is taking place.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:40):**  And a protein that shows that the nitrogen and sulfur ratio is between 10 and 12 to 1. These are  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:51):**  key things that I look for in an analysis that tell me, even without looking at the plant material,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:40:57):**  that that plant was harvested when its prime nutrient production was led to maximize. And the  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:06):**  number one thing, I don't just use a number like an RFQ, I like to go through the minerals. I like  
**[0:41:13-0:41:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:13):**  to see the proportion of some of them, how magnesium is present in proportion to phosphorus,  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:21):**  and how the two of them are in proportion to calcium. Most of the forage analysis does not  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:28):**  include some of the key trace minerals. You'll have to pay a little extra to get them. But as much  
**[0:41:33-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:33):**  as possible, if you get the wet chemistry analysis, you should be able to gather the information on  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:40):**  how much nitrogen was there, how much sulfur was there, and that are key elements for understanding  
**[0:41:47-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:47):**  that the forage is of high quality. Sylvia, what is a book or resource that you would recommend  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:54):**  the most often to growers who have a desire to learn more about these, about the areas of  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:41:58):**  managing dairy nutrition and producing high quality forages? Oh, I have many that I have been  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:05):**  reading. I have to say that my philosophy as a dairy nutritionist changed quite a bit as I  
**[0:42:12-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:12):**  exchanged many conversations and read many of Jerry Brunetti's books and CDs. So I will highly  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:20):**  recommend the one that I think most of the time I'm quoting and making references is The Farm as  
**[0:42:26-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:26):**  an Ecosystem, where you kind of try to view the whole farming in a way that is interdependent.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:35):**  That would be probably one that I would highly recommend. I like also Grass, The Forgiveness of  
**[0:42:41-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:41):**  Nature by Charles Walters. Quite interesting, he put grass into perspective and how to understand  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:48):**  that amazing plant species. I've read and referenced many times Jim Garish's book, I believe  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:42:56):**  his Management-Intensive Grazing, I think is the title, or something close to that. And yeah, and I  
**[0:43:01-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:01):**  always go back to papers, to the Albrecht papers, when I try to understand that relationship between  
**[0:43:08-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:08):**  health and soil. It's just amazing how much it was discovered at one point, and we can use that.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:16):**  And lately I've been recommending Sarah Flagg's book, The Art and Size of Grazing as well.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:23):**  I think all of those books that you've mentioned are really very good references. And there's also  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:29):**  Soil, Grass, and Cancer, which is also a very good one, André Boyson.

**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:43):**  I was, like I explained, doing my change of philosophy back in the times when I was staying  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:50):**  at home with the kids, and trying to decide whether, you know, I will be approaching  
**[0:43:56-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:43:56):**  my career in a different way, and Boyson played a huge role in my thinking. Wonderful. Sylvia,  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:04):**  what is the question you wish I would have asked? What's another topic that you think might be  
**[0:44:08-0:44:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:08):**  important to talk about? Oh, I don't know. I think, you know, many times I like to talk about  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:18):**  animal behavior, and how that affects the way they eat, and the way they actually show signs  
**[0:44:25-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:25):**  of health or not so much health. I'm finding myself, you know, reading and researching more  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:33):**  and more about the aspect of the animal behavior, and how that relates to grazing and feeding  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:42):**  sequence. What do they like to eat in the morning? What they prefer to do when they have  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:49):**  pasture that is in certain characteristics. So, I'm fascinated by that. So, that's something that I'd like to talk.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:44:57):**  That does sound like a very fascinating topic. I had no idea that animals would prefer to eat  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:02):**  different things at different times of the day. Yes, that is the case. Yes. What have you  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:08):**  discovered that surprised you? Well, I've done, you know, trips outside of the United States and  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:13):**  met with the excellent veterinarians and nutritionists, and they have pointed out to me,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:20):**  you know, to observe them. If they have choices in terms of area to go and graze, to observe  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:28):**  what they prefer to bite on first, and what they prefer to buy after the first room and field.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:35):**  It's fascinating to see that cows prefer grass, and they like to nibble on fresh, soft blades  
**[0:45:43-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:43):**  of grass, and they have a memory. They go back and eat that, but that is affected by what the farmer  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:52):**  feeds before they are let out on pasture. So, it's fascinating to see how you can change their  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:45:59):**  behavior by actually changing what you feed them before. Some farmers prefer to feed their grain  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:05):**  before they go out and pasture, and we've noticed that more and more that when the cow, especially  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:12):**  in the early season, not let out too hungry, she actually has a better way to digest if you feed  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:18):**  them some good quality grassy hay. You have to train them though. So, sometimes I think we have  
**[0:46:24-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:24):**  to make sure that they can eat that fast and in a way that they can go out quickly to what they like,  
**[0:46:32-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:32):**  which is the sweet grass. But they do like to have good digestible fiber before they go out and  
**[0:46:40-0:46:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:40):**  pasture. And many farmers will say, well, once the cows taste the pasture, they will never eat any  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:47):**  hay, which are any hay. That's where the training comes because you know that they need that  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:53):**  particle before they go out and pasture. So, you have to sweeten that with a little bit of diluted  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:46:59):**  molasses. Maybe that's a trick that you can use. So, they actually have the room and prepare  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:05):**  before they have 20, 30 pounds of wet grass getting into their system. So, it's just very  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:13):**  interesting to see how they change their behavior of feeding when the farmer realizes what needs to  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:20):**  be changed. I was just going to ask you that question. How does the feeding behavior, how does  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:25):**  the behavior in the pasture change when they have that hay and the room and buffer before they go  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:30):**  out on the pasture? Well, and it's quite interesting. There are a couple of researchers  
**[0:47:34-0:47:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:34):**  show from Utah State showing that they then go mostly for the legumes with a higher protein  
**[0:47:42-0:47:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:42):**  content and higher mineral content. And so, when farmers have this mix of grasses and legumes  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:50):**  pasture, and the first feeding, they select the first third of the plant and scoundrels have been  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:47:57):**  with three or four pounds of hay in the stomach and then let out to a green pasture. They go out  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:04):**  first for the legumes and then they come back for the grasses. But the opposite is true when they  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:10):**  are fed grain rather than hay before going out on the pasture. Wow, that is intriguing.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:19):**  Yeah, they are able to sort and select among the plant materials because they have  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:25):**  a keen sense of smell and move around in a way that sometimes we think they don't know  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:31):**  what they're looking for, but they do know. Now, there's a lot of inherent wisdom in natural  
**[0:48:36-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:36):**  systems it seems. Aside from the change of feeding dry hay before going to pasture instead of grain,  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:45):**  what other feeding changes have you learned about it? Are you recommending to growers?  
**[0:48:49-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:49):**  Recommending them to make sure that the cows have easy access to water. And the truth should be told,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:48:58):**  actually, water is a less appreciated nutrient. They assume that the cows will only need water  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:06):**  and will come back to the barn if they are very thirsty. But in reality, it's just like all.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:11):**  Sometimes we are thirsty and just out of convenience, we decide not to drink. With  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:18):**  us, it's just showing dehydration. But in a dairy cow, the main product that they put out  
**[0:49:24-0:49:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:24):**  is 88% to 92% water. So, you go see that we are restricting an animal that has a high  
**[0:49:35-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:35):**  requirement for water. And so, I have seen a direct correlation between milk production  
**[0:49:43-0:49:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:43):**  and water accessibility. And even if the water is in the barn and they say, yeah, but they have it,  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:49):**  it is ready for them. If it is too far and it is too hot, guess what? They will just lay down  
**[0:49:55-0:50:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:49:55):**  in the shade and they will not go back to the farm and drink the water. Especially the timid cows,  
**[0:50:02-0:50:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:02):**  if you have a mix of earth calf heifers and other cows. Yeah, that's again, animal behavior plays a  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:09):**  role in there. Yeah, and I can speak from experience. When I was doing dairy nutrition  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:15):**  a decade ago, thinking back, I would say probably half or more of the dairies that I started working  
**[0:50:21-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:21):**  with, we changed their watering system, watering capacity. And in many cases, there was an almost  
**[0:50:29-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:29):**  immediate two pound to four pound per head per day gain as a result of changing. Well, just having  
**[0:50:36-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:36):**  abundant water that is clean in a large open top containers rather than small containers. Cows  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:43):**  really don't like drinking out of a water cup. And if you can have a large tank for them to drink out  
**[0:50:49-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:49):**  of, they're going to drink more water as a result. That's right. They will drink more water at a time.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:50:55):**  So, they don't like many trips. They like drinking a lot and satisfying their thirst and then  
**[0:51:04-0:51:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:04):**  continue on with eating. Many times I have problems with people just viewing ruminants  
**[0:51:11-0:51:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:11):**  as they view people because in reality, what makes a cow happy does not make a human happy.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:20):**  So, having water- Try feeding people grass and see how that works. Yes, exactly. Having water  
**[0:51:30-0:51:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:30):**  in rectangular narrow containers and having water with materials that would change the smell.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:39):**  Dairy cows don't like that. We underestimate their ability to relate with palatability and  
**[0:51:46-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:46):**  consumption. We want them to eat more, but yet we are not making the most palatable feed for them.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:51:54):**  We think that we can turn them into a product that is full of weeds that in reality are bitter  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:52:00):**  and they can eat the weeds if they are soft and young. Once they are grown and overgrown,  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:52:07):**  reality is that they don't like to bite on that and they bother their eyes and so forth. So,  
**[0:52:13-0:52:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:52:13):**  yeah, we need to make sure that we tend to their senses, to their smell, their eyes,  
**[0:52:21-0:52:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-nutrition-impacts-dairy-performance-with-silvia-abel-caines/#t=0:52:21):**  and so forth. Sylvia, I want to say thank you so much for joining us, for being on the podcast,

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 20:11:39)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:06):**  that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:11):**  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:14):**  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,

**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:31):**  Hi friends, I'm back with Gabe Brown.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:33):**  Gabe, you've done a lot of work since we spoke last time,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:36):**  or maybe I should say a lot has come to fruition.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:39):**  Your book has been published  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:41):**  and lots of people are talking about it.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:44):**  How are you feeling about the reception the book has had?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:47):**  Thank you, John, it's a pleasure to be with you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm a bit overwhelmed.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:51):**  I was approached a number of years ago by Chelsea Green  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:56):**  Publishing and they asked if I'd be interested  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:59):**  in writing a book and I didn't think I'd have time to do so,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:03):**  but they were a bit persistent and I made the time  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:07):**  and we got it done.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:09):**  And I'm a little surprised, I guess,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:12):**  flattered by the reception that I've had from it so far.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:17):**  A lot of people are very interested.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:19):**  We've had really good reviews.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:22):**  I know that it's number one in Amazon  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:24):**  and three different categories right now.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:27):**  It's first week out, but things are looking pretty good.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:31):**  That is exciting.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:32):**  And I personally find it really exciting as well  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:35):**  that the news and the desire,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:37):**  the hunger for information about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:40):**  has grown so rapidly in the last few years,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:44):**  even five years ago, there wasn't nearly the attention.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:49):**  How have you seen the interest in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:52):**  evolving and shaping?  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:54):**  Well, I certainly agree with you, John.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:56):**  I've been 15 plus years out on the speaking circuit,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:01):**  traveling around, speaking at conferences.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:03):**  And like you say, it's really only the last,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:06):**  especially three years where it used to be  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:11):**  you pick up a magazine, it was rare to find an article  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:14):**  on soil health or regenerative ag.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:16):**  Now you can't hardly pick up a farm publication  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:20):**  without seeing one or more articles on soil health  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:24):**  and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:26):**  And it really is overwhelming, which is good to see.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:30):**  But I think it also goes to show that producers  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:35):**  are truly searching for something else.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:39):**  Let's face it, the current industrialized,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:41):**  commoditized farm production model  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:44):**  that we're seeing so prevalent today just is not working.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:48):**  And we see that with the low returns  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:51):**  in production agriculture.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:53):**  And I think the only way and the best way,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:56):**  I should say that producers are gonna mitigate this  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:00):**  is by taking things into their own hands, so to speak,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:03):**  and focusing on their resource and really working  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:06):**  with nature instead of against her.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:09):**  Gabe, I know this is something you've spoken a lot about,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:12):**  but I think worth thinking about.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:15):**  When you say farmers use the resources that they have  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:18):**  and working with nature, what is the resource,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:23):**  the number one resource that growers have  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:25):**  that they're not taking advantage of?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:27):**  What are they mostly missing?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:28):**  I really believe, John, that as producers,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:35):**  we really don't understand how soil functions.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:40):**  Whenever you buy something, whether it be an attractor,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:43):**  a combine, a baler, you get an owner's manual,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:47):**  but nobody gives farmers or ranchers  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:50):**  an owner's manual for the soil.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:53):**  So we are taught just through formal education  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:59):**  and through what we read and see on newspapers, TV,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:04):**  publications from extension universities  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:07):**  that farming and ranching, it's like a chemistry set.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:11):**  We have to add these inputs in order to get X in return.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:18):**  But really, when we look at the regenerative model,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:21):**  it's about capturing sunlight through photosynthesis,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:26):**  and I don't care if you're in grain production  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:28):**  or if you're in livestock production,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:31):**  it all goes back to harvesting the natural solar energy  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:36):**  through photosynthesis of plants,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:38):**  pumping that carbon into the soil  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:40):**  and feeding the life in the soil, the biology in the soil.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:44):**  Now, I don't want people to think  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:46):**  that I'm saying zero inputs.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:48):**  That's not what I'm saying at all,  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:50):**  because we can use inputs to tweak things  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:54):**  where they're needed, but we really have to focus  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:58):**  on the natural process of photosynthesis,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:02):**  cycling that carbon, feeding soil,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:04):**  biology, then that biology is what drives the system.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:08):**  Gabe, I think there's a lot of room for misunderstanding  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:10):**  when we talk about soil carbon, developing soil carbon.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:14):**  We had an experience recently  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:16):**  where we were working with farms  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:17):**  where with the application of some paramagnetic rock powder  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:23):**  that had essentially no carbon present,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:27):**  it triggered carbon sequestration  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:30):**  and a carbon buildup in the soil,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:32):**  such that soluble carbon levels  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:34):**  as measured on a soil analysis almost doubled  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:37):**  in a matter of about a six month period  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:40):**  to such a degree that it essentially ended up  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:44):**  creating a nitrogen deficiency  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:46):**  in the crops that were growing in these various fields.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:48):**  We tried this experiment in about 20 different operations,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:51):**  and that really has led to a lot of interesting conversations.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:54):**  I think nitrogen is one of the pieces  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:56):**  that is very often mismanaged or poorly understood  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:00):**  that has a really negative impact on carbon.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:03):**  So speaking to your comment about the owner's manual  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:06):**  and understanding soil function,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:07):**  how do you think about soil carbon and nitrogen  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:10):**  and managing the exchange between those two?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:13):**  Well, we have to remember that everything has a carbon  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:17):**  to nitrogen ratio, it's a balance,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:19):**  and you can't separate the two.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:22):**  They work together in harmony.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:25):**  We also have to remember that  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:28):**  soil typically is a low nitrogen system.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:33):**  You know, we have to look at it and realize that  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:39):**  in the current production model,  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:41):**  we're trying to outproduce our environment  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:43):**  time and time again,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:45):**  and we're adding these copious amounts of nitrogen.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:48):**  When we do that, what happens?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:51):**  The soil is going to try and balance  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:52):**  that carbon nitrogen ratio.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:54):**  Where is it going to go for the carbon?  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:56):**  It's going to go for the carbon in the soil,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:58):**  and it's going to go for the carbon  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:01):**  in those soil aggregates.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:03):**  And as that biology then consumes the carbon  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:06):**  in those soil aggregates  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:08):**  to balance the carbon nitrogen ratio,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:11):**  we're actually having a detrimental  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:12):**  and negative impact on soil function,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:16):**  a negative impact on water infiltration,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:18):**  a negative impact on water holding capacity.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:22):**  One of the things we focus on  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:25):**  on our operation here is that we do not add excess nitrogen.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:33):**  And what we're seeing then is this balance is in play,  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:38):**  and we have the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:41):**  Now, we may not get as high a yield as, say, for instance,  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:48):**  some of the farms, ranches in the surrounding area,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:52):**  but our profitability is much, much higher.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:55):**  And I tell people, I will take profit over yield any day,  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:01):**  because in order to be sustainable as an operation,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:06):**  we have to be profitable.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:08):**  So I think we got to get out of this mindset  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:11):**  of the yield and pound mentality  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:15):**  and get into one where we're talking  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:17):**  about profitability per acre.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:19):**  And that all has to do with working  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:23):**  with carbon-nitrogen ratios, and carbon is a cycle.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:27):**  So often we forget that.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:28):**  We hear all this about climate change,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:30):**  and we have too much carbon in the atmosphere,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:32):**  and that's true. We do.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:34):**  And people want to sequester it into the soils,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:37):**  but I try and educate them,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:39):**  no, we need to cycle it in the soils,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:41):**  because carbon is a cycle, and it cycles through.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:44):**  You know, a soil aggregate only lasts  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:46):**  approximately four weeks.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:48):**  So we got to take this carbon out of the atmosphere,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:50):**  put it back into the soil, so it can be cycled via biology  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:55):**  to feed the plants that are growing in that ecosystem.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:01):**  I think that's a very key point.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:02):**  It also relates to some of the things that I've learned  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:06):**  over the last several years  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:08):**  about soils needing to be aerobic versus anaerobic.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:12):**  I learned that a healthy soil needs to be an aerobic soil,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:17):**  with good oxygen levels.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:19):**  And what I've learned more recently is, in fact,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:21):**  that's not necessarily true, but what soils really need  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:24):**  is they need good gas exchange.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:26):**  It's not so much about the oxygen level  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:27):**  as it is about good gas exchange.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:29):**  I think you're describing essentially the same thing.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:32):**  Yep. We need to realize that soils are subaquatic ecosystems.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:39):**  You know, biology lives in and on thin films of water  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:43):**  in the soils.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:44):**  Well, we need those pore spaces then to provide the home  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:51):**  for that biology.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:53):**  And we have to have, like you say,  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:56):**  that exchange of oxygen, other gases, it respirates.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:02):**  The soil's alive, and it respirates.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:04):**  And we need that porosity in order for it to do so.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:08):**  Now, interestingly enough, John,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:09):**  I'm part of a long-term research project  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:14):**  that's going on at my place.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:16):**  Dr. John Norman and Abe Collins with Landstream  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:20):**  are quantifying what we've been able to do on our operation  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:25):**  by using these regenerative practices.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:27):**  And over the past six months,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:30):**  they've pulled over 190 four-foot soil probes  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:35):**  off of 523 acres of my operation.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:38):**  And what Dr. Norman found is that much of my soils now,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:45):**  he says, are approaching 70% pore spaces.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:50):**  Think of that.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:51):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:52):**  Yeah, it's incredible.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:53):**  And besides that, we now have, on average,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:57):**  on those 523 acres,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:00):**  96 tons of carbon per acre in the cycle,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:05):**  which is just a phenomenal amount.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:07):**  I tell people, I can walk onto any operation  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:12):**  and tell the potential profitability of that operation  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:15):**  by the amount of carbon they have cycling in their system.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:19):**  And remember, carbon and nitrogen go hand in hand,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:22):**  but we look at the amount of carbon you have cycling.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:25):**  That can tell the potential profitability of an operation.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:29):**  So I think this data that Dr. Norman and Abe Collins  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:33):**  are collecting is going to be instrumental  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:35):**  to proving to society that regenerative agriculture  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:42):**  can play a major role in many of the ills  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:45):**  we're seeing in society today,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:48):**  whether it be problems with too much nitrogen,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:52):**  phosphorus going down our watersheds,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:54):**  with too much CO2 in the atmosphere.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:58):**  And I think it's going to relate to nutrient density of foods also.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:02):**  And we are going to be testing that in the near term.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:05):**  So regenerative agriculture can play a major role  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:10):**  in mitigating a lot of these quote,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:12):**  unquote ills we're seeing today.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:15):**  Gabe, you've mentioned a couple of pieces  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:16):**  I want to follow up on,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:17):**  but first I want to go back 96 tons of carbon per acre.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:21):**  A couple of thoughts that come to mind  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:23):**  when you mention that figure.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:25):**  One is, do you have any idea where you started originally  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:29):**  or what the surrounding environment is at the moment?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:33):**  Yeah, unfortunately, John, I tell people,  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:36):**  you know, when I started down this path 25 plus years ago,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:40):**  I didn't know that the good Lord  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:41):**  had those four years of disasters  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:44):**  he was going to put me through,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:46):**  three years of hail and a year of drought.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:48):**  I was just trying to stay alive.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:50):**  So we do not have an original benchmark on this.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:54):**  Now we can look at surrounding farms  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:57):**  and we're just starting to do that.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:59):**  Dr. Norman says, most of the farms in the area  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:04):**  are going to be about 10 to 20 tons of carbon per acre.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:08):**  So, wow.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:10):**  The second thought that comes to mind  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:13):**  thinking about that quantity and volume of carbon  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:16):**  held in the soil profile,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:17):**  we just spoke a few moments ago  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:19):**  about the carbon to nitrogen ratio.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:21):**  How much nitrogen per acre does that represent?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:23):**  And that's where you can gauge the yield  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:26):**  and productive potential of a farm,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:28):**  because it's not just carbon  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:29):**  that also reflects nutrient release capacity as well.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:33):**  That's right.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:34):**  And I don't have those figures in front of me.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:38):**  I'm waiting for Dr. Norman to release them.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:41):**  So I don't want to speak out of turn,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:44):**  but it's a significant, significant amount.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:47):**  You know, what we were seeing is that a lot of my soils,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:52):**  it's not uncommon to have well over 200 pounds  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:56):**  of nitrogen per acre being available to the plant.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:01):**  So there's a significant amount that's available.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:04):**  Now realize some of that's in the organic form,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:08):**  some's in the inorganic form,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:09):**  but with the biology that we have,  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:12):**  and this gets into a whole another topic  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:14):**  that I think needs to be brought up and said,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:18):**  you know, there's a real problem  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:21):**  with the soil testing that's being done today  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:25):**  for the fact that the vast majority of soil tests  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:28):**  only look at the inorganic fraction of NP and K  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:32):**  that's in the soil.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:33):**  They don't look at the organic fraction  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:36):**  and then the biology that's in the soil  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:39):**  and how much of that organic fraction,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:42):**  the biology will be able to convert to usable forms.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:46):**  And now just recently, of course,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:48):**  there's new research that come out  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:50):**  that shows that plants are actually able to take up  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:54):**  some organic forms of these nutrients.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:57):**  So that's a big problem in production agriculture.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:01):**  We're not giving credit to all we have available  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:05):**  in healthy functioning soil.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:08):**  And so because of that, the result of that  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:10):**  is we're over applying many of these nutrients.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:14):**  I'd love to explore that a bit more, Gabe.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:15):**  Can you elaborate a bit on how can plants absorb compounds  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:20):**  that are not simple ions from a soil solution?  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:23):**  I'm not the person to ask that, John.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:26):**  I do not hold a PhD in this.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:28):**  I would recommend you have someone like Ray Archuleta on  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:32):**  who could explain that more in depth and further.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:34):**  The research paper that I read shows that plants themselves  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:41):**  have the ability to absorb some of those complex nutrients.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:49):**  They used to think that wasn't possible,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:51):**  but new research has shown that it actually is occurring.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:56):**  That's been a contention that I've had for a long time  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:59):**  that plants must have the capacity  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:01):**  to absorb microbial metabolites and amino acids  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:04):**  and similar compounds from the soil profile.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:06):**  And one of my arguments has been that  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:11):**  plants have the capacity to absorb complete compounds  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:14):**  in the form of insecticides.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:15):**  We know that we can use insecticide seed treatments  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:17):**  and have them absorbed by the plant  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:19):**  and be distributed throughout the entire plant profile,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:22):**  neonicotinoids being a perfect example.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:25):**  And what makes us think that they wouldn't be able to do  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:29):**  the exact same thing with naturally occurring compounds?  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:33):**  That you're exactly right.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:35):**  You're exactly right.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:36):**  I think it goes, John, to show how little we really know  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:41):**  about healthy soil ecosystems.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:45):**  You talk to soil microbiologists such as Dr. Chris Nichols,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:51):**  and she'll tell you,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:52):**  she doesn't know 1% of what's happening in the soil,  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:56):**  and she spent her life studying it.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:58):**  So this is very, very complex.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:00):**  And just look at the amount of biomass  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:04):**  that was generated in healthy native prairie ecosystems.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:09):**  Okay, now there was nobody out there  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:12):**  adding all these inorganic compounds, NPK, et cetera.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:17):**  So how do we get that type of production  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:20):**  if plants weren't able to absorb  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:24):**  some of these organic compounds?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:26):**  Gabe, when you look at evaluating  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:29):**  soil nutritional availability,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:32):**  you spoke a moment ago about the challenges  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:34):**  of current modern soil analysis,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:37):**  which I completely agree with.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:38):**  In fact, a couple of months ago,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:40):**  we posted a podcast episode,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:42):**  which is titled The Fallacy of Soil Analysis.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:46):**  What tools do you use to evaluate what is happening  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:49):**  with the soil's potential nutrient release?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:53):**  So when I say we,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:55):**  I'm talking about my partners in soil health consultants.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:59):**  And what we are primarily looking at  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:03):**  is the Haney soil test.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:06):**  In our opinion, it's the best test out there today  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:10):**  to give farmers a good indication  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:13):**  of how biologically active their soils are  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:17):**  and the amount to that organic fraction  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:21):**  that's gonna be converted inorganic.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:22):**  So it looks at both inorganic and organic fractions.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:26):**  That's the quickest, simplest, most inexpensive test  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:32):**  out there today to get producers  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:34):**  moving in the right direction.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:37):**  And then you can use another host of tests  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:40):**  such as leaf tissue analysis, et cetera,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:42):**  to further understand what's happening  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:46):**  in your particular field.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:48):**  In our work, we've used plant sap analysis  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:51):**  and tissue analysis serve a similar role.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:53):**  I think from my perspective,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:56):**  it's important for us to measure crops  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:57):**  using some type of metric, if for no other reason  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:01):**  than that plants are the final report card.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:04):**  The crop that we're growing is the final report card  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:06):**  of what is actually truly happening in that ecosystem,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:10):**  which speaks to a comment you made a few moments ago  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:12):**  about nutrient density.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:15):**  How much nutrient density have we lost in our foods  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:17):**  and how can these types of management practices  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:21):**  help shift it?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:22):**  It's a great question and one that I wish we honestly knew.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:26):**  Fact of the matter is there are very, very few studies  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:31):**  being done on the nutrient density of our foods.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:36):**  And when you think of it, John,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:38):**  who's gonna do that and fund those studies?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:41):**  In whose best interest is it?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:43):**  You're not gonna see funding  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:45):**  by the fertilizer industry for sure.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:48):**  You're not gonna see funding by healthcare professionals.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:52):**  I hate to say it, but let's be honest,  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:54):**  they make their living more or less  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:56):**  not in preventative medicine, but in treatment.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:00):**  And so the data, really good concrete data is not out there.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:05):**  Now there's a lot of work being done currently.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:08):**  I've been working with Dr. David Montgomery,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:11):**  who wrote the book, Dirt and Growing a Revolution  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:14):**  and several others.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:15):**  He is in the process of doing some nutrient analysis  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:21):**  on foods to find this out.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:25):**  And so we're actually gonna be doing some testing  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:28):**  on our operation for that project.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:31):**  And part of the Landstream project  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:34):**  with Abe Collins and Dr. Norman,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:36):**  we're doing nutrient testing on what's being produced  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:39):**  on our ranch so we can see.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:42):**  Now there's some study that's done a number of years ago  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:45):**  that say anywhere from 25 to 75% of the nutrients  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:53):**  have been lost over the last 40 to 50 years.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:56):**  But realize this varies tremendously  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:59):**  on where that food product is being produced.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:06):**  I read a study here, it's been a year and a half ago now  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:10):**  where they tested oranges for vitamin C  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:13):**  and they actually found some of the oranges  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:15):**  had zero vitamin C in them.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:18):**  Now, why in the world would you eat an orange  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:20):**  if it wasn't for the vitamin C, right?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:24):**  But that's the kind of the path we're on.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:27):**  And because there's nobody that really has skin in the game  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:32):**  for finding this out,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:33):**  there's very little data out there unfortunately.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:37):**  The other thing we're not talking about  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:39):**  is all these plant secondary metabolites.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:42):**  Dr. Fred Brevins in his new book  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:45):**  that's just gonna be released here next month  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:48):**  talks a lot about that.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:49):**  Now, one of the things we're really missing,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:53):**  as producers, we add NP and K and a few micronutrients,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:57):**  but a plant needs 19 to 20 different elements  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:01):**  to grow and thrive,  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:02):**  but it also needs to produce  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:04):**  all these plant secondary metabolites.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:06):**  And that's where really we're getting  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:09):**  a lot of the health aspects from by eating these foods.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:12):**  It's not just about the protein we get  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:15):**  and the major nutrients,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:17):**  it's about all these micronutrients  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:19):**  and plant secondary metabolites.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:20):**  I know that in the fruit and vegetable space,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:23):**  what is it that people really care about?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:25):**  They care about sweetness and flavor and aroma.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:28):**  There's a lot of conversation happening  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:31):**  in different parts of the industry  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:33):**  about beginning to quantify  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:34):**  some of these plant secondary metabolites  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:36):**  and develop quality parameters  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:38):**  for what really defines a high quality fruit.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:40):**  And it's a very challenging conversation  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:42):**  because these plant secondary metabolites  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:44):**  can be very different between different species of fruit.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:47):**  It's a broad field to look at,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:49):**  but I think it's something that's important  
**[0:23:51-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:51):**  for us to look at.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:51):**  For many years, there's been conversations  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:53):**  about food biofortification.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:55):**  And essentially, we're using different terminology,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:59):**  but that's essentially what we are describing  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:01):**  is we're talking about natural biofortification  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:04):**  as it was meant to be.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:06):**  And we see this in, I'm blessed here,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:09):**  we have about 2,000 acres of what we consider  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:13):**  true quote unquote native range,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:15):**  which to our knowledge, it's never been tilled.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:18):**  And when you look at the animals that we have,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:22):**  whether it be cattle or sheep or chickens or our hogs  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:25):**  out on those native pastures,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:28):**  they're eating a wide variety of different plants.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:32):**  We have well over a hundred different species  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:34):**  of grasses, forbs, and legumes on there.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:37):**  When you understand that plants have the ability  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:41):**  to send out red exudates to attract biology,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:44):**  to bring them and cycle different nutrients,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:47):**  think of what that brings to that plant.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:53):**  It brings a tremendous amount of diverse nutrients.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:57):**  And then the animal eating that plant will in turn  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:01):**  be able to have access to all those different  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:05):**  secondary metabolites.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:07):**  And then us consuming that animal,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:10):**  or if it's a vegetable, that plant,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:13):**  we satisfy our nutritional needs by the diverse biology  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:20):**  in the soil, bringing that diverse amount of nutrients  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:24):**  to those plants.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:25):**  Well, in today's production model, we've eliminated that.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:29):**  We've eliminated the ability of that plant  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:32):**  to get the diversity of nutrients it needs.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:36):**  And in turn, that then has a negative impact  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:41):**  on human health.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:44):**  I had the good fortune just a month ago  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:46):**  to spend a week with Dr. Zach Bush,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:50):**  one of the premier cancer treatment researchers  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:54):**  in the United States.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:55):**  And he became totally convinced that the diseases  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:02):**  and illnesses we're seeing in society today  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:05):**  are due to the fact that we no longer have healthy soil.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:10):**  Because of that, we're not getting these nutrients  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:13):**  in our plants.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:15):**  And so Dr. Bush now has committed the rest of his life  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:19):**  to regenerative agriculture and getting people to understand  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:23):**  that in order to truly find human health,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:28):**  we have to have healthy soil.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:31):**  Look for some good things coming out from Dr. Zach Bush.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:35):**  I will look forward to that.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:36):**  I'll look forward to sharing that.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:38):**  That actually speaks to a question  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:40):**  that I was hoping to ask you, Gabe,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:42):**  is you've done some exceptional work in the last 25 years.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:47):**  You've had a lot of intriguing experiences.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:50):**  What are you working on right now  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:51):**  that you're really excited about?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:53):**  Or perhaps a different way of asking that question is,  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:56):**  what do you hope to contribute in the future?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:00):**  What substantial changes do you still hope  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:02):**  that you'll be able to create?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:04):**  What I really am trying to do with the rest of my life,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:09):**  John, now is to educate consumers  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:13):**  that they're buying dollar matters.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:16):**  And if they truly want to be healthy,  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:20):**  they need to source the food that they're eating  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:25):**  from farms and ranches who are using regenerative practices.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:30):**  So I want to educate farmers and ranchers  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:34):**  on how to regenerate our farms and ranches,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:38):**  but then also let's face it, John,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:41):**  we're not gonna change Washington.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:43):**  We're not gonna change the farm program.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:45):**  You can tweak little bits.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:47):**  The only way we're gonna drive wholesale change  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:52):**  in the way crops and livestock are being produced today  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:56):**  is by educating consumers  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:58):**  and then them voting with their buying dollars.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:01):**  So we need to quantify what's happening  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:06):**  on these regenerative farms and ranches  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:08):**  that we are truly able to produce food  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:12):**  that's higher in nutrient density,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:14):**  and that that food then can be available  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:18):**  to the general public.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:20):**  And that's what I'm focused on right now.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:24):**  Gabe, I think that's very admirable.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:26):**  And I think I have an additional viewpoint  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:28):**  on the possibilities of driving change.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:30):**  I think there is another way  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:33):**  of driving wholesale substantial change,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:36):**  which you are already doing,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:38):**  and that is you achieve what you incentivize.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:42):**  You are demonstrating a system  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:44):**  where growers can be more profitable and more successful  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:48):**  than with what they're currently doing,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:49):**  which you spoke to at the beginning of our conversation.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:54):**  And to me, that is so important and so fundamental  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:57):**  because it is much more powerful to be for something  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:01):**  than it is to be against something.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:03):**  And it's not useful for us to have conversations  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:08):**  about, let's say, anti-GMO or anti-round-up or anti-tillage.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:13):**  Those are not productive conversations in the long term.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:17):**  I think we need to simply elevate  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:21):**  to a higher level of thinking  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:23):**  and develop farming models and farming systems  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:26):**  that can bring farms to a much higher plateau of performance  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:30):**  that they completely displace the status quo.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:33):**  And I think doing that, which is something  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:35):**  that I perceive you already doing very well,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:38):**  is actually going to be a very big driver of change,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:41):**  perhaps even greater than changing consumer demand.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah, and you're exactly right,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:47):**  and that's why I talked about profitability up front.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:50):**  Now, in saying that, I am excited here.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:53):**  I've been working with doing a number of projects  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:56):**  with General Mills, and General Mills,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:59):**  especially in their organic division,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:02):**  has already gone down the path  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:04):**  of incentivizing regenerative practices for their producers.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:09):**  And we're just starting to enter into a phase with General Mills  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:15):**  where we're going to do it for oat production also,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:18):**  and they're going to incentivize their producers  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:20):**  to move down the regenerative path.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:23):**  So that, too, will lead to increased profitability  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:26):**  for producers.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:28):**  I think you're exactly right on that, John.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:30):**  I don't disagree with the need for consumer education  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:33):**  and driving consumer demand.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:35):**  Just looking at the history, it seems to me  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:38):**  that educating consumers is something  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:41):**  that takes a lot of time, costs a lot of money,  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:45):**  and happens very slowly, unless there is a major epidemic  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:49):**  or some food safety crisis or something like that.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:51):**  Because if we look at the history  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:53):**  of the organic industry as an example,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:56):**  it is something that certainly has made an impact  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:59):**  and is having a growing impact in the last couple of years,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:02):**  but is still just a fraction of a percent  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:05):**  of our total food supply chain.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:09):**  You're right. That's correct.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:10):**  I do think, though, that that crisis is occurring,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:14):**  and we have a human health crisis in this country.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:18):**  You know, the United States spends more on healthcare  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:20):**  than any other country in the world,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:22):**  yet last I heard, we're about the 42nd healthiest country  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:25):**  in the world.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:26):**  We're first in cancer, ADD, ADHD, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:31):**  many of these other diseases.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:33):**  If that isn't a crisis, I don't know what is.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:35):**  Now, certainly, it is going to be a long process  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:40):**  to make consumers aware and educate them  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:43):**  that it's directly related to the food they're eating  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:47):**  and how the food's being produced in this country.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:51):**  So, continuing with that thought, Gabe,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:54):**  what needs to happen?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:56):**  Let's assume that the consumer demand is there,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:00):**  and I'm just making up a hypothetical number,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:03):**  let's say by 2025.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:06):**  What needs to happen to be able to produce that healthy food  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:11):**  for everyone in the country or in the world, for that matter,  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:13):**  which is a separate conversation.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:15):**  What needs to happen to produce healthy food  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:17):**  for everyone in the country by 2025?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:19):**  Well, first of all, I don't think it's out of the realm  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:23):**  of possibility whatsoever.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:25):**  What's going to happen is,  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:27):**  and we talked about this earlier, John,  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:29):**  how you said in the last three years especially,  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:32):**  we're seeing an overwhelming interest and demand  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:37):**  for knowledge of regenerative agricultural practices.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:41):**  All it's going to take is we have to change producers,  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:46):**  one heart, one mind at a time.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:49):**  Producers are coming to the realization,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:51):**  this is not working, the current production model.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:55):**  So, to go down a regenerative path,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:57):**  one in which they can actually lower input costs  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:01):**  while benefiting the environment,  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:05):**  it'll benefit their pocketbook tremendously.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:08):**  And in turn, of course, they'll be producing food  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:11):**  of higher nutrient density.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:12):**  And I think it's just a matter of people such as yourself  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:16):**  and producers listening to your podcast  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:19):**  getting the information out there.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:21):**  And my partners and I with Soil Health Consultants  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:25):**  are overwhelmed daily by the amount of requests  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:28):**  we're getting people wanting to move down this path.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:32):**  So, I think this can occur quickly.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:35):**  I think it's taken a long time for the snowball  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:37):**  to start rolling, but it's coming.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:40):**  I see it coming quickly as well.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:43):**  Gabe, if you could reach out and touch one thing  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:48):**  on every farming operation across the country,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:51):**  what would you change?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:53):**  The thing I would change the most,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:55):**  and it's kind of ironic tonight,  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:57):**  we get 2 to 2,500 visitors on our ranch every summer  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:01):**  from all over the world.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:03):**  And they come here expecting to see this utopia  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:06):**  and expecting to get a magic recipe card.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:09):**  And I said, just look, I grow things.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:12):**  We have to have living plants in the soil  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:17):**  as long as possible throughout the year.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:19):**  Too many producers, they grow just that cash crop  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:24):**  and then the land sits idle.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:26):**  If we could just cover the land with growing plants,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:30):**  that's gonna make the biggest impact on farms and ranch.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:37):**  That's intriguing and it's such a powerful point  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:41):**  and it goes to what you mentioned earlier as well.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:44):**  I believe we don't give enough credit  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:48):**  to the tremendous capacity that plants have  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:50):**  to generate soil ecosystems and sequester carbon.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:53):**  And we don't stop to think about how the dozens of feet  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:57):**  of topsoil in the Midwest were originally created.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:01):**  They weren't created with tillage and synthetic fertilizers.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:06):**  Now, on that point, let me give you  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:08):**  some more interesting data that Dr. Norman found out  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:12):**  when doing all these soil samples on our place.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:15):**  Now, again, when I started and bought this place in 1991,  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:20):**  unfortunately we did not archive the soils.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:23):**  So the closest thing I can get to it is neighboring soil  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:28):**  under the same type of management scenario.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:30):**  Now, even my neighbors have moved into no-till.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:33):**  No-till is predominant in South Central North Dakota here.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:38):**  But in saying that, the A horizon on my neighbor's soil  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:43):**  is four to five inches, okay?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:46):**  Dr. Norman now on our crop land fields,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:49):**  the A horizon is 28 to 29 inches.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:53):**  Okay, explain that one.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:55):**  Explain that difference.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:57):**  And just in a matter of a hundred yards.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:00):**  The difference is, yeah,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:02):**  the difference is regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:04):**  And there's much more to it than simply growing a plant.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:07):**  We need the biodiversity of plant species, insects, animal.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:11):**  You need the whole program.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:13):**  But in saying that, if we could just get people  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:16):**  to grow things and through photosynthesis cycle  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:19):**  that energy, that's free to us.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:22):**  The other thing I'm just always,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:25):**  we talked about carbon nitrogen ratios.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:28):**  Above every acre, there's approximately 32,000 tons  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:33):**  of atmospheric nitrogen.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:35):**  Why any farmer would write a check first  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:37):**  if synthetic nitrogen is just beyond me?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:40):**  I just can't understand that because it's free.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:43):**  All these things are free.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:45):**  Obviously you have to grow something.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:47):**  So the cover crops gonna cost you some money,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:49):**  but you know what I'm saying?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:50):**  We don't have to write the checks for it.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:54):**  You know, it's all there if we take advantage  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:57):**  of these principles of nature.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:01):**  Wow, that's tremendous.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:04):**  The nitrogen is there.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:05):**  Also, I think there are tremendous untapped  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:09):**  rock mineral reserves of nutrients in the soil profile  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:12):**  that do not show up on a typical soil analysis  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:15):**  that once we have biology and plants  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:19):**  and ecosystems working for us,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:21):**  we begin releasing minerals  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:23):**  that are locked up in the soil reserves.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:25):**  You're exactly right.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:27):**  One of the things I did,  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:28):**  and I could get in trouble for this,  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:30):**  but I was part of a project two years ago  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:32):**  where we looked at four different management  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:37):**  and I call it stewardship scenarios.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:39):**  You know, one was a heavy tillage operation.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:42):**  One was a minimum till, one was a no till,  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:45):**  and then there was mine.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:47):**  And the amount of nutrients that are available in my soils  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:53):**  was five to eight times higher  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:56):**  than any of the other operations we looked at.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:00):**  And without getting in trouble,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:01):**  I'm just gonna say they were similar soils,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:05):**  close proximity, okay?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:07):**  Well, people for years told me,  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:09):**  Gabe, your system's gonna crash.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:11):**  Yes, you can cycle nitrogen by growing legumes,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:15):**  but you're gonna run out of phosphorus and potassium  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:17):**  and all these other nutrients.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:19):**  And my answer was always, when?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:22):**  I can mine that all the way to China  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:24):**  if I can get a root down there.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:26):**  Because if I can get a root down there,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:27):**  I'm gonna get biology down there.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:29):**  We're gonna be able to cycle those nutrients  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:33):**  from that parent material, just like you said,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:36):**  from the rocks.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:37):**  It's absolute fallacy to think  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:40):**  that we can't cycle enough nutrients  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:43):**  to sustain profitable crop and livestock production.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:49):**  You know, we can do this,  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:51):**  but we have to have living plants feeding biology.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:56):**  And, you know, plants take in sunlight through photosynthesis.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:00):**  They produce all these compounds, which they excrete.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:03):**  Well, part of those compounds,  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:05):**  some of them combine with water and form a mild carbonic acid,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:09):**  and that helps break down all this parent material,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:13):**  making those nutrients available to biology.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:16):**  Something that we've observed on crops in these situations,  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:20):**  I'm sure you've observed as well,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:22):**  is we can have an abundant supply of phosphorus and potassium  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:27):**  and other macronutrients without constantly adding them,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:29):**  even in the form of manure and compost  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:31):**  in some geological profiles.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:34):**  And I think this is a very important conversation for us  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:37):**  to have, particularly in the context of phosphorus.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:40):**  I mean, we have a very finite, very limited,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:43):**  known global supply of phosphorus  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:45):**  that is currently on track to be depleted  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:47):**  in about 25 years from now.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:50):**  So we're going to have to figure out  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:52):**  how to grow crops without constantly applying phosphorus,  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:54):**  and we're going to have to figure it out relatively soon.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:57):**  Well, we have not applied any synthetic nutrients  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:02):**  on our own land since 2007.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:05):**  And yet, to show I have plenty of phosphorus.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:09):**  I honestly believe that the majority of producers  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:13):**  out there in the United States,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:15):**  if they've applied phosphorus once in the last 20 years,  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:18):**  they've got enough phosphorus to last them,  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:21):**  probably their farming lifetime,  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:23):**  if they have the biology that can cycle that phosphorus.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:29):**  That's a key if.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:31):**  And you're correct, because when you do the math  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:33):**  of what the actual phosphorus requirement are  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:35):**  in terms of grams or pounds of phosphorus per acre per crop,  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:38):**  it's very, very low.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:40):**  There's only a small amount of phosphorus removed.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:42):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:44):**  And then you look at potassium.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:46):**  You know, to my knowledge, I have never, ever seen  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:51):**  a research project paper  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:54):**  that has shown a positive yield response for adding potassium.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:00):**  Yet many producers do it year after year after year.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:04):**  I just don't understand it.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:06):**  Gabe, I'd like to circle this conversation back around  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:11):**  to the beginning where we started.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:13):**  We spoke a little bit about the book  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:15):**  that has been published.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:18):**  What didn't make it into the book?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:21):**  What would you have loved to include  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:22):**  or what has happened since it was published  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:24):**  that you would have loved to have included  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:25):**  that didn't make it?  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:27):**  Well, what didn't make it in there was this data  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:30):**  that Dr. Norman has collected and is analyzing on my soils  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:37):**  and how much porosity in the soil,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:39):**  how much water infiltration,  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:41):**  the tons of carbon we have per acre.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:44):**  That's all new since realized books  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:47):**  are about a two-year project in the making.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:49):**  So that's all new and didn't get in there.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:53):**  Although maybe there will be a sequel down the road.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:58):**  Finding up another project.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:01):**  Yeah, speaking, going back to, we moved away from it,  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:04):**  but when you spoke earlier of his research,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:08):**  achieving 70%, did I understand you correctly  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:10):**  by saying 70% air space in the soil program?  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:13):**  That's correct. In some of the samples,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:16):**  he said we're approaching 70% pore spaces or air spaces.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:21):**  In there, they had a real hard time.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:23):**  They were trying to collect four-foot samples.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:26):**  And in some cases, they were getting less than two feet  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:31):**  of soil because it had compressed so much  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:34):**  just pulling the sample out.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:36):**  And he was just amazed by that.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:38):**  In his career, he had never, ever seen that.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:41):**  Gabe, you don't understand that you can't do that  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:43):**  because you're going to have to rewrite all the textbooks  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:45):**  that stick to soil that's 50% solid and 25% air and 25% water.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:51):**  Yeah. Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:54):**  You know, it was all new to me, but realize Dr. John Norman,  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:58):**  I don't know how familiar your listeners are with him,  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:01):**  but he is the guy who invented most of the instrumentation  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:07):**  that NASA uses to collect data from their satellites.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:12):**  So when they're looking at biodiversity  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:15):**  and biomass production on the Earth,  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:19):**  Dr. Norman invented all this instrumentation.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:22):**  So this guy is extremely, extremely intelligent.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:26):**  And for him to say that, and I had the good fortune.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:29):**  He spent a couple weeks on our ranch with us  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:31):**  and just tremendous opportunity to visit with him  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:35):**  and to listen to him talk about what he was seeing  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:39):**  on our operation.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:40):**  Well, that is certainly exciting and gives all of us a vision  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:45):**  and a goal to strive for in our operations.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:48):**  So you've certainly been a leader in that, Gabe.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:50):**  Thanks for developing that vision.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:53):**  My pleasure.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:54):**  Thank you for being here.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:55):**  Enjoy this conversation.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:56):**  I look forward to speaking with you again sometime soon.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:58):**  Thank you, John. Always a pleasure.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:01):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:04):**  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:07):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:11):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:13):**  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:16):**  We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:19):**  and disease and that to grow healthy crops,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:22):**  we must first think different about agriculture,  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:24):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:27):**  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:30):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:32):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:34):**  with less risk of crop failure.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:36):**  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.  
**[0:44:39-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/from-dirt-to-soil-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:39):**  Thanks for listening.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, friends. Welcome back. This is Jon and you are at the Regenerative Agriculture podcast,  
**[0:00:05-0:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  where we talk about the agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:10):**  plant health, soil health, and of course, ultimately public health, which is what  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:15):**  regenerative agriculture really should be about. My guest for this episode is Ben Taylor-Davis,  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  who is a farmer and regenerative agriculture consultant from the UK. Ben, I'm really glad  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  to be able to have this conversation with you today. We're going to have some fun with people  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  listening to you with your accent. That's going to be an interesting exercise for some people,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  I suspect. So welcome here. Tell us a little bit about your personal story and background.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  How did you get to be in this spot of having, as you say, all of your play and pleasure being in  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  your business of doing regenerative agriculture consulting? Thank you very much for having me on.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:55):**  And yes, my accent is a very broad, Gloucester accent, so from the West country of the UK.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  The story as I, for myself and to get to this point where we're having this chat today,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  quite a long story, to be honest. And I'll keep it as brief as possible, but essentially,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  I went to university, graduated, thought I'd come back to the farm. My father decided that  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:21):**  there really wasn't a position for me on the farm back here. So I applied for a job to become an  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  agronomist. And that was in the traditional sense of the word with ag chem and fertilizer and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:33):**  everything that came with standard agronomy. And that rather took me on a path, and a very  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  comfortable path for an awful lot of years. And I married my wife, Helen, three beautiful children.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  And then unfortunately, on the 28th of September 2012, my son, aged 16 months, was tragically kicked  
**[0:01:50-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:50):**  in the head by a horse and suffered some very severe brain damage. And what was a very  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  comfortable life and a lovely life, all of a sudden was thrown into disarray. And we spent  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  months and months by his bedside in intensive care. And pretty much my world collapsed,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:09):**  and mostly mentally. So from that moment on, I probably spent a couple of years just wondering  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  why and how and who was I and what was I and what did I want. And my wife finally persuaded  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  me to apply in the UK for a Nuffield scholarship that is offered to young farmers to travel the  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  world, an opportunity to travel the world and learn about agriculture from around the world.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:33):**  And I grabbed that with both hands. And I was so fortunate, I'll never forget landing in Mino  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  Airport in North Dakota, and really deciding that this was the moment where I really, really make  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  the most of agriculture and find out as much as I could. And needless to say, I had a most wonderful  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  time in America, in Canada, in South America. And I was fortunate to China and Russia and Australia  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  and everywhere. And, of course, that's where I stumbled into people like Gabe Brown and things  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:04):**  like that and started seeing that there was an alternative way of farming that really just set  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  that little bit of a niggle in my mind. And I got home and I started talking to people about soil  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  a little bit more. And I think I started reading a little bit and more and read more and then,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  and then I started getting in contact with some authors of books and podcasts. And to my amazement,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  they wrote back and said, Yeah, you know, this is really a journey and it's really good. And I was  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  just overwhelmed by the response of people like yourself, you know, I made contact and you're  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  like, Yeah, sure, let's have a chat. It was fantastic. And that's where I started thinking,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  you know, perhaps the the mainstream agronomy was something that was obviously becoming a problem.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:48):**  And after reading books like the Red, Chasing the Red Queen, really starts getting your whole...  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  You said that you read a little bit. I think I saw your reading list. I don't think a little  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  bit is the appropriate description anymore.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  No, not anymore. I mean, there's never a book that doesn't recommend two, three or four more.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  And I find myself, I think I'm up to 600 books on as tentative as you call it regenerative  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:14):**  agriculture. But I mean, anything from rewilding to the fourth phase of water right the way through  
**[0:04:19-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  biodynamics and paramagnetism and all sorts of books in between. I just find them... And the  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  more obscure you think a book might be in terms of regenerative agriculture, the chances are,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  the more you learn. I think the mainstream books you can probably... If you read five to ten really  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  good books on regenerative agriculture, you know, I think that's as much as you need. It's the fringe  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  books that really do add and bring to the party a lot of information. And I'm staring at a pile  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  literally about three foot tall on my desk of to read. So yeah, I haven't stopped yet.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:00):**  That's as big as mine.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  Bigger maybe.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  Yeah, so on my own farm, I decided to start implementing all of the regenerative techniques  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:10):**  and ideas. My father, interestingly enough, back in the day was a mixed farm of livestock and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  arable crops. Of course, life became much simpler with the invention of ag chem and fertilizers and  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  things and didn't need the livestock so much and it was hassle. I've gone a bit crazy on livestock  
**[0:05:27-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  and decided the full integration of anything from pigs to chicken tractors to goats and sheep and  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  cattle or ducks and geese, all to try and bring diversity back into my farming system and implement  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  pretty much practice what I preach and demonstrate that as well.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  When you speak about diversity and bringing all these different forms of livestock and birds back  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:51):**  onto your farm, what type of scale are we talking about? And what are the different types of  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:57):**  crops that we're talking about? Are you doing a few dozen or a few hundred or a few thousand?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  So the farm, so in acres wise, is just over the 500 acres, which is about an average size farm  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:08):**  for the UK these days, I guess. It's probably edging on the small side, to be honest. So what  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  have I got? I've got 100 ewes. What makes it more complicated is I've got five breeds and they're  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  only about 20 ewes within that. So we've got 20, essentially five 20 head flocks of which we spend  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  a lot of time trying to promote the breeds and the rare breeds in the UK. So we've got 100 breeding  
**[0:06:34-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:34):**  ewes, so with about 150 lambs. We have anything between four and 55 pigs depending on farrowing  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  exactly in the whole process of breeding. Cattle, we're only at 14 at the moment, just about to  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  increase that to 24. It's all a bit of a slow process in terms of getting our land in order  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:00):**  or a good enough order in order to extend the livestock in such a way that the idea for us is  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  to try and get, and it's very hard in the UK to get two crops off a single cropping year, but we're  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  using clover understories and things like that and then enhancing that clover as soon as the harvest  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:18):**  is done, then the livestock and that and cover crops and that sort of thing. So the idea being  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  to really make sure that the diversity crosses over between the arable side and the livestock.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  You described your personal journey a little bit and the ways that you had accelerated learning  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  by reading a lot, listening a lot to what other people were talking about. How did things change  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  on your farm as a result of all that learning? How have your farming practices transitioned over the  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  last decade or so? Okay, fairly massive. I've always been really into the environment and just  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:51):**  enjoying wildlife and nature. Back in 2000, I did actually plant 12 kilometers of hedges and we  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  established quite a lot of field margins and things like that to try and protect species and  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  some of the rarest species in the UK. So that's always been part of it. So that's the start. What  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  have we done? We happen to live in the most beautiful triple S.I. which is a site of special  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty which all flows to the River Wye.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  And the River Wye is quite a famous river in the UK but it has some serious issues. No serious  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  issues are related to phosphate and the amount of phosphate entering that river is quite frankly  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  a real problem. So what we started to look at is how do we prevent the movement of phosphate to the  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  river? Number one, why would I want to have a valuable asset that was phosphate and let it end

**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  so whether it's compost or cover crops, that sort of thing to actually just hold on. Our  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  cation exchange capacity is pretty low. Our TEC is around seven, eight or was. We're building on  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  TECs with our carbon improvement. And the other huge issue in regenerative agriculture for my own  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  farm and it was a conversation that I had with my wife, we were potato growers. No-till potatoes is  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  something of a problem and it's something I was very, very on the brink of giving up  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  growing potatoes. And it was only chatting to my wife who said, if you give up growing potatoes,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  how are we ever going to show that they can be grown? People are always going to want to eat  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  potatoes. How can we actually start to show that these can be grown in a way that doesn't totally  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  destroy the environment? The government over here is pushing a thing called the five a day fruit  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  and veg. We should all be eating five fruit and veg a day. Unfortunately, most of the fruit and  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:45):**  veg production in the UK is some of the most destructive to soils and the environment. So what  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:50):**  I'm really focusing on right now and the great big challenge is regenerative potatoes. And I spent  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  two years conjuring up regenerative potatoes in my head until somebody told me about Brendan  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:04):**  Roqui and said, listen, this bloke's doing exactly what you're talking about. And unbelievably,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  I just about squared the circle of everything I needed to do and then realised somebody was  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  already doing it. And it's just one of those things you think, oh my goodness, if only I'd have  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  only if I'd have found him. So I've got a lot of time for what he's doing over there. And we're  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  very much implementing huge amounts of that over here now with our own challenges.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  Yeah, making those connections and finding the others is something that is so important and has  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  become increasingly challenging in the mainstream social media networks that are out there, which is  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  one of the things that we're hoping to resolve with Kind Harvest. So you're there now. Thank you  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  for joining. The conversations have been pretty incredible, haven't they? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, very  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  good. Yeah. So when we look at how, when you consider your personal journey and the changes  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  that you've made on your operation, our views evolve and our perspectives evolve. What is  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:03):**  something today that you believe to be true about agriculture that is perhaps different from the  
**[0:11:10-0:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  view of many others in the ag community? Right. I think that the focus of agriculture is the three  
**[0:11:21-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:21):**  main inputs of agriculture, sunshine, or energy, precipitation, and CO2, which are all free.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  Unfortunately, there is no value to free. Yeah, we prefer to buy things we have to pay for,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:37):**  currently. Quite. The interesting thing I have, and one of the opening conversations I have with  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  a lot of people is about the farming model, as far as I'm concerned, which is a very simple model. We  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  take three free things, we put it through a catalyst, or our soil, and we make money. And  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:53):**  if you get too far away from that, then we that's generally where we end up with problems and debt.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  Most people say, oh, that's very, very good. You know, I can't do anything about the sun,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:02):**  I can't do anything about the rain and the CO2 is rising. So you know, exactly what would you like  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  me to do? And I actually think you can do an awful lot with the sun, of capture, of taking that  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  energy, as essentially we harvest energy. So we've got to learn to harvest that energy far better.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:20):**  So I think that's really important precipitation, we happen to be on very degraded soils, mostly in  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  the UK now. Precipitation, we either have far too much at one stage or not enough when we need it.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  And therefore the management of this precipitation through carbon through through organic matter  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  retention, things like that, is awfully all, as far as I'm concerned, another really important  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  part of regenerative agriculture. CO2 is something that's rising. And if I can take some of that  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  rising CO2 and put it in my soil, I will help to capture the precipitation. So in actual fact,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  I think that for me, the biggest focus should be on those three, three things. And yeah, like you  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  say, I think most people focus on those minute input buying, and we spend hours and hours and  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:05):**  hours discussing micro macro nutrition and error and seeds and everything like that. And I can't  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  remember the last conversation or anybody had on managing the free. I have got a big smile on my  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:18):**  face. I love this conversation. I love the perspective of the three free elements. And I  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  actually think over the last couple of years, I've started speaking about the systemic deficiency of  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  carbon dioxide. And it really catches people by surprise when we talk about increasing  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  photosynthesis and photosynthetic efficiency past the threshold of what is considered to be common  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:39):**  or normal, which is very degraded. It's easy to manage the nutritional components of that.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:44):**  And almost immediately we run up against the bottleneck of inadequate carbon dioxide.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  I know that this is something I've spoken about, but what are your perspectives on  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  carbon dioxide delivery? How can farmers improve their carbon dioxide supply?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  So I'm a big believer. And one problem I do have is my books, the amount I read, I get cross-wired  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:03):**  in terms of being able to reference people. I can recite many a passage, but unfortunately,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:08):**  I can't often name the author that wrote it. And that's a fault of mine, but something I really  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:14):**  believe in is the amount of carbon dioxide in the soil is something that actually we should focus an  
**[0:14:20-0:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:20):**  awful lot more on. Respiration of soil microbes is something that is, and as far as I'm concerned,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:29):**  the moon pays a massive influence on healthy soil and the way they breathe. And from what I recite  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  is that as the moon phases, much like they do to tides, pull and push water, as they pull water up  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  through the soil profile in a healthy soil, all of the carbon dioxide that's accumulated in that soil  
**[0:14:49-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:49):**  in that soil rhizosphere is expelled out of that soil onto the surface of the interface between  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  the soil surface and the atmosphere. And that is what I believe and why I believe that the  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  stomata of most plants happen to be on the underside of a leaf, to capture that high  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  concentration of carbon dioxide. So essentially, and then as the moon phases change, that allows  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  it to breathe and allows the oxygen to pass back into the soil, and there we have yet another  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:20):**  wonderful system. So if we're trying to increase carbon dioxide going into plants or the  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  availability, surely it's all about trying to get more and more soil microbial respiration to occur  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  in order to provide more and more and more. So it comes back to taking these free things again,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  using them correctly to become that cyclical pump of actually giving more and more carbon to the  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  plant. And as that solar panel grows a little bit larger, it can take some more energy from the sun,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  and that can pump more root exudates into the soil and it becomes yet another wonderful nature  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  circle. What you're describing is a shift in perspective from carbon sequestration to carbon  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  cycling. And I think this is sometimes lost in the conversation about the opportunity to capture  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  carbon and mitigate climate change and global warming, etc. The reality is that from an  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  agricultural productivity and a soil fertility perspective, our desire should be to cycle large  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  volumes of carbon. The more we can sequester, the more we can release through microbial respiration  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:30):**  for plants to absorb. That increases photosynthesis and we sequester even more. It's a self-perpetuating  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  cycle. And that perspective is commonly lost that we actually we want to lose a lot of organic  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  matter as carbon dioxide. But we want to lose it when there are green growing plants  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  photosynthesizing capable of capturing it. So anything lost when we have bare soil is lost forever.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  Absolutely. So like I said, here in the UK it's that focus very much on... we're pretty awful  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  here in the UK of the most energy hitting the earth comes obviously in July, August, September,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  which is generally the time where we have absolutely nothing growing because we've just taken  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:15):**  harvest. And therefore we lose probably about a third of the energy that comes in the whole year.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  So this is why we're focusing on these understories and catch crops. But the weather's so  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  variable with these catch crops. We grew various catch crops and try to mix up some C3s and C4s  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  and did all that this year. And then we got a real quite a cold end of August and our C4s barely grew  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:41):**  an inch tall and everyone thought they were fairly pathetic. In actual fact, if you dug the roots,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  you realize they were actually trying to do quite a lot of carbon building and feeding biology.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  So that's why I love this clover understory of these low clovers that act as my herbicide mulch.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:58):**  So I don't, you know, mother nature always always looks at covering her skin at any time.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  We call them weeds, she calls them cover. So I put my clover in there and I allowed that clover then  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:10):**  to release nitrogen to the plants I'm growing. And then as soon as we've taken that harvest,  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  all of a sudden I've got A, a great cover, B, a wonderful animal feed and more clover  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  getting into the system and wonderful rooting of drainage and allowing all my soil biology  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  to really improve. Let's describe the context a little bit. Many of our listeners may not be  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  familiar with UK agriculture. How is your environment and ecosystems different and on  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:39):**  what are kind of the status quo management practices for agriculture in the UK?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  Okay, despite the size of the UK and from what I think a lot of people look at  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  tidal islands and assume there could only be one weather pattern and one soil type and pretty much  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  one form of agriculture. In actual fact, we have some of the most varied climate, some of the most  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  varied soil types. And when I say varied soil types, we could have a 10 acre field with 12 soil types  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  running from 80% high magnesium clay at the bottom of a field to the top of the field  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  literally 200 meters away, 200 yards away. And that could be blowaway sand and then everything  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  in between. It makes it a very hard thing when you're doing soil testing and things like that.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  There is no average field. We haven't got these lovely, there are some over in the  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  eastern part of the UK, but most of the UK has got huge diversity in soil types.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  We've also got quite diversity in climate too. So that really does determine what's grown.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  But essentially for an awful lot of time, it was plough based system across the whole of the UK  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  and parts of it still very much are focused on ploughing. We very much focus on cereals,  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:55):**  various pulses, there's potato growing areas, there's sugar beet growing areas as well,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  and there's veg production areas that are getting more constrained at the moment.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  Yes, essentially it was bashing the soil and when we were doing it with horse and plough, of course,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  we were only ploughing at a depth that really didn't affect biology. And I use the example  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  of an awful lot of, we've got a lot of fence posts from stock fencing. And if you look where  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  a fence post rots, it never rots at the tip. It only ever rots at about two to three inches  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:27):**  from the soil surface downwards where the soil microbial activity in life is. And of course,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  the old fashioned ploughs used to plough no deeper than that. So we used to, they used to recycle  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  an awful lot of that biology. But unfortunately, with the invention of tractors and larger tractors  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:43):**  and bigger tractors yet again, and wanting to do more, of course, the ploughs needed to cover more  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  acres. So in order to cover more acres, you end up with a wider plough furrow. The only way you can  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:54):**  end up with a wider plough furrow is to plough deeper. That becomes this problem of people  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  ploughing eight, nine, 10 inches deep in order to throw a 20 inch furrow. And of course, you then,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  then that's when the massive degrading soil problems that have come from. So we've carried  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:11):**  on and we we started to do a really good job and we were good with high inputs, growing a lot of  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:18):**  cereals. So for instance, wheat in the UK, most wheat growers would be aiming for 10 tonne a  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  hectare or four tons to the acre of winter wheat. Many pushing 12 tonne a hectare, so you know,  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  on an even 15. So getting up to five, six tonnes an acre winter wheat. That of course comes on the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  back of huge amounts of inputs too. That becomes that very much the treadmill that is lots of  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  nitrogen, lots of disease, lots of disease, lots more nitrogen, fighting fungicides, fighting,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  fighting with insecticides and very much trying to put fires out constantly.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  Coming back to your comment about the three free things in agriculture,  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  that would make an interesting phrase if you said it multiple times really fast,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  three free things. You talked about the yields that are being produced, but what about the  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  profitability of managing that ecosystem with those high input costs?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  And this is pretty much another thing that started to frighten me. I, my father passed away and I was  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:10):**  handed all these box files and things like that from when he was farming at the farm. And what I  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  noticed was that in 1994, we did four tons of the acre of winter wheat and our input costs were  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  about a fifth of what I took over from him and farm conventionally. And the price of diesel,  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:29):**  the price of nitrogen, the price of all inputs, the very fact that a very small amount of herbicide,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  a very small amount of fungicide was ever needed and things like that. And the reality struck that  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:39):**  in actual fact that the problem is not so much yield because our yields are plateaued. There's  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:43):**  a few that are pushing better boundaries. But if I was going for 10 in 1994, I'm not growing,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  I wasn't growing any more than that in the year 2010, that becomes a real problem. So the focus  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  for us is actually the huge input costs of just, I'm liking it very much the frog in the boiling  
**[0:23:02-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:02):**  water or the water analogy where I think we've all sat in this water that's slowly got warmer  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  and warmer and warmer and warmer to the point where we haven't jumped out. But in actual fact,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  if somebody came to the UK right now and said, well, these are going to be your input costs,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  and this is your profitability, that would be a real problem. You'd be like, well, the profit  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  really doesn't square the investment. You know, there's a lot of farmers that are still profitable,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  don't get me wrong and doing okay. But unfortunately, and it's very much the fringe  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  of soil quality that we are seeing, those with more soil quality have got more ability to keep  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  going in the way they're doing. Those that are on slightly compromised soils have got to the stage  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  where they realise that in actual fact, we can't keep taking and putting very little back. And  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:50):**  something really has to change and these spiralling costs are actually making businesses, many  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  businesses actually lose money. You know, that's where we bring the three free things back. Hang  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:59):**  on a minute, how far away have you got from that? And I guess for the main of the UK and one of the  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  major penny drops, we got a weed called Blackgrass. We used to control it very easily with one  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:10):**  herbicide, then a bit of resistance came and we started using two, three, four, five, six, seven  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:17):**  herbicides, still getting very little control. It was only at that point that we realised that  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  herbicides were totally failing. What were the other options? Well, of course, that's when you  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  start looking at cultural management. And all of a sudden you start thinking, well, my soil is in  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  such poor health, that we are self selecting an environment for this weed to become established.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  So in actual fact, if we can change the environment in which it's growing and improve  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  the soil conditions, the Blackgrass funny enough, disappears. And that's exactly what's happened.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:49):**  So that's something that really has hit home to a lot of growers in the UK. And something that  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  really has probably started the regenerative movement, because once you once you have that  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  seed, so I think people just want to open that a little bit more. So now today, in addition to  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  farming, you're also doing consulting for regenerative agriculture, you described the  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  Blackgrass as being perhaps one motivator of that. But when you think about the business context,  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  the business environment, as you just described it with constantly squeezed profitability in the  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  mainstream system, has the profit motive and the desire to improve profitability gotten people to  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  consider adopting more regenerative agriculture practices. What does the landscape look like in  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  the UK at the moment of transition to regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  That's a pretty tricky question to interpret, because unfortunately,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  places like Twitter that I spend an awful lot of time on, as I'm sure you're aware,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  but I find I surround myself with most regenerative growers in the UK. So you end up  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:48):**  with a quite a blinkered view of how you think the UK is in so much as, wow, everybody's on the  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  journey. On the consultancy side of things as well, of course, I'm only being contacted by  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:58):**  people that are desperate to just have some help along the way, you know, how can I do this and  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  that sort of thing. And I'm really enjoying that. Of course, I don't really think that's the norm.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  Still in the UK, I do think there are people very much still in the bathtub with the frog.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  Questions are being asked all the time, you know, new generations are coming through and saying,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:21):**  you know, I pretty much like to have this farm in 25 years time, the way we're farming at the  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:27):**  moment, I think we're going to be devoid of soil, if nothing else. So in actual fact, I think there  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  is definitely conversations being had on many farms about how the problem is in the UK, and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  it's something and the reason why I'm writing a book, to be absolutely honest at the moment is,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  I think a lot of places would go, well, you know, it's great. It works with John Kemp in America,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  and it works for all these people in Australia and Brazil and things. England, of course,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:53):**  is very different, very different. We've got different, different soil, you know,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  we got a different club. We got, we haven't seen clay like this. And before you know it,  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  that's why I'm writing this book, which is called Moron. And it's about M-O-R-E-O-N, you know,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  the addiction of British agriculture to inputs. You know, if you put a little bit on more,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:14):**  more must be better, and you put more on and more on and more on, and that's what we've got to.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  And one of my titles of the chapter that I want to write at the moment, but unfortunately due to  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:23):**  Covid, I can't get around an awful lot of very, very good growers in the UK of regenerative.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  The title is entitled, It Won't Work Here. And I've just go around all these, all these traps  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  in the UK and prove that, you know, they're doing it and doing it well. So I think one of the  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  biggest barriers for me is proof. And that's what I think will be really useful about my book coming  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  out that will hopefully. Human nature is the same in the world over. Everywhere you go, if people  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:52):**  want to avoid doing something, they will say it won't work here. Yeah. There are people who have  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  given us that line in probably every state in the US, and yet there are growers who are sometimes  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:03):**  within very, very close to them proximity who are doing it successfully. So the principles work  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  successfully everywhere. I have a suggestion for you, though. I think you should change the title  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  of your chapter from it won't work here to it is working here. Yeah, yeah, quite. Absolutely. I  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  think that it won't work here is more of a yes, yes, it really can. And it will. And it certainly  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:29):**  is. And it's working here. It's amazing when you start doing some talks and doing some things and  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:36):**  talking to clients and things, and especially the generations where they can remember their  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  grandfathers doing various things. And they're like, we used to do that. And I was like, yeah,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  you probably did. You probably did any wonder why we haven't. And that's why I think some of the  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  best books I've got, and their reference books are from the Ministry of Ag of the UK from from 1890s  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  to about 1890s to about 1930s, pre development of our friends, Harbor Bosch, and everything that  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  came with that and some of the knowledge. The worry for me is the word science. And I really  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  don't like the word science because we all assume that a lot of people assume science was only  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  developed in the last 50 years, really. And before that wasn't science, it just happened. But of  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  course, science has been happening forever. I mean, the very fact that natural selector was  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:27):**  artificial selection of all the plants we now grow. I mean, the science is phenomenal that went  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  on. And therefore, you know, I really do feel that we should start learning about everything,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  you know, and that's the book I've been buying up recently and just overwhelmed by what they  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  talk about. I'd like to go back to your extensive reading list. You have your own website, and  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  you've published the reading list of all the books that you've read and how you have rated them.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  Where can people find that? And what are the top books that you would recommend for people?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  So the website is the easy bit. So that's www.regenben.com. And for those that can't  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:06):**  actually understand my accent, I'm sure we can put it on a link after.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  We will do that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  Top books. Now, funny enough, well, we had a brief conversation before we came on air,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  didn't we, about ranking books and ranking interest and that sort of thing and what would  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  suit some wouldn't suit others. And I just wonder whether I need to go back over my whole book  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  collection and actually start putting a traffic light system in for beginners, intermediate and  
**[0:30:34-0:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  almost experts of Regen Ag. Because I do think there needs to be a beginning or just wondering  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:43):**  the subject. You know, you can't go far wrong from Gabe Brown is a wonderful story and a wonderful  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  book to read. Nicole Masters For the Love of Soil is another great, great opening book into Regen  
**[0:30:54-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  Ag. I love John Stieker's book as well on Soil Handbook. Then I think if you're going to step  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  up a little bit from there on in, that's when books like your own, I think are very, very good.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:07):**  I was just ready to say, you're not going to mention my book?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  My goodness.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  That's a level well up over and above the beginners, so to speak. I think Matt Powers'  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  book that he's just released is fantastic at illustrating some of the more complex parts  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  of the whole regenerative system. You know, I just find his energy just absolutely fantastic.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  And it comes through on his book. And then the expert books would be things like The Fourth  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  Phase of Water, one of my most favourite books. It absolutely, I've read it twice, probably going  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  to read it for the third time. Whilst I've ranked them all in order of sort of difficulty and  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  importance, I wouldn't want somebody thinking about Regen Ag to pick up The Fourth Phase of  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:50):**  Water and probably be put off if I'm honest.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:54):**  So as a personal question or recommendation for you, if you enjoy The Fourth Phase of Water and  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend his earlier book that is titled Cells,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:04):**  Gels and the Engines of Life. Understanding that book and what its implications are,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  what it describes, will completely revolutionise our perspective of how nutrients flow inside  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  plants. It completely destroys the foundation of plant physiology and rewrites it from the ground  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  up in a very elegant, beautiful and simple manner, which is really delightful.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:24):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  Have you read any of Stephen Herrad Bühner's books?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  The Lost Age of Plants and The Secret Teachings of Plants and Plant Intelligence?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  Yes, very good.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:39):**  Those are some of my favourites as well.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah, no, I mean the problem is when you've read so many it's very hard to keep naming them.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  I mean, I've got a huge bookcase here and another bookcase there and I look across and just,  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:54):**  you know, I look at them and I just think there's just some wonderful writings.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:59):**  Yeah, I think you and I could have many interesting conversations because I've,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:03):**  I don't often speak to people who read quite as much as I do and so it'd be interesting to see  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  where we have not overlapped.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:10):**  Yes, perhaps we should exchange book reading lists.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  Yeah. With the experiences that you've had, the phone calls that you're getting from growers  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  who desire to begin a transition to more regenerative agriculture practices,

**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  And what I found, and I know I had my mental health issues when my son was kicked.

**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:39):**  And that doesn't compute.

**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  farm, yes, it will work for you.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  You'll say, ah, they've got different grain than me, different soil type.

**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  you pull a SAP analysis and all of a sudden the farmer has the data in front of his face  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  that says, oh my goodness, I don't need 300 units of nitrogen.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:27):**  I only need 20.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  So I think it was yourself that introduced me to SAP analysis 18 months ago, was it?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  Two years ago, probably.

**[0:38:42-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  the Netherlands.

**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  chasing them up a fortnight, 14 days later.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:55):**  They are very, very efficient.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  What I do enjoy about an overcrop control is that they are very professional in what  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:01):**  they do.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:02):**  They don't try and give some sort of interpretation that is left to you as an agronomist or you  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  as a specialist to actually interpret that information.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  Because the trouble is with all these, a lot of places come back and say, well, this should  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  be this and this should be that.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:16):**  But in actual fact, as you know, as well as I know, the interaction of all the different  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  elements is often the reason why something is actually working very well or working not.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  And it's very hard to come up with blueprint to actually interpret SAP analysis.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:32):**  I think our big revelation, similar to what you just described from our use of SAP analysis  
**[0:39:39-0:39:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:39):**  was the inversion, a complete reversal of the mainstream agronomy paradigm, which is  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:47):**  that you pull a sample, such as a SAP sample, and you identify the desired level and you  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:53):**  add whatever is low.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  And what we observed quite quickly is that the reason five of the 20 different elements  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  are low might be because two of them are too high.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:05):**  And you reduce those two and the other five come up all on their own and you don't have  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  to apply any.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:09):**  And I think here in the US, sometimes growers look at the price and the cost of taking the

**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  our discomfort around these conversations is to have them more often and to become more  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  clear about what it is that we're speaking about and how we're speaking about it because  
**[0:46:45-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  there are many things that earlier in our conversation you described the influence of  
**[0:46:52-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  lunar activity on the tides within the soil and gas exchange within the soil and what  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  I have experienced over and over is that when I start having this conversation with people  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  who have a close connection to life and living ecosystems and they pay close attention to  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  what's happening and what's going on, they all share these common experiences, these  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  common themes of experiencing and observing things in natural ecosystems that aren't really  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  explainable by our current mechanistic scientific perspective and it's really interesting to  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  me that almost universally farmers might have different theological and spiritual backgrounds  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:41):**  but almost universally they will acknowledge that there is more to agriculture and farming  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:47):**  and there is more to life than pure science and chemistry.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  No, I absolutely agree. I mean the very thing that makes us human, what we've been having  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:58):**  various conversations of late, you can take two soil samples of two fields next door to  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  each other. Those two fields, one is pretty much in a dreadful state and one could be  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:08):**  in an absolute wonderful state and you send it through all the tests you can ever think  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  of and the results may very much come back, they're almost identical, you couldn't tell  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:18):**  them apart and yet as a human you could take two footsteps across each of those two fields  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  and know that they are totally and utterly different. That makes us unique.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  Yeah and we have the same with different types of soil amendments. We can look at limestone  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:33):**  from different quarries that from a chemistry perspective has the absolutely identical calcium  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  content, magnesium carbonate, magnesium content and carbonate and bicarbonate content. You  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  can grind them down to the same particle size and distribute them on a field side by side  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:49):**  and to get two completely different results. So is it chemistry? Is it biophysics? What's  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  going on? There's a lot more to that story. Well Ben, I want to say thank you very much  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4Ep2_Ben_Taylor_Davies_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:00):**  for sharing your knowledge and wisdom and your experiences. I've really enjoyed having

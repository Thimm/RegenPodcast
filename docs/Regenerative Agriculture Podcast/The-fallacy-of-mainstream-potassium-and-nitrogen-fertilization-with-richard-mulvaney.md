### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2020-04-14)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, friends.  Welcome back to the Regenative Agriculture podcast.  Today I'm here with a soil scientist and researcher  who I've heard quite a bit about, Richard Mulvaney  from the University of Illinois in Urbana.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:14):**  Richard has done some interesting work  looking at nitrogen and potassium in soil profiles  and the value that we get out of fertilization,  and also trying to better understand those environments  where fertilization may be less necessary  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:29):**  or not produce the crop response that we anticipate.  So Richard, I'd love to hear more of your story  and your background.  Can you tell us how you came to this space and the journey that  brought you to looking at fertilization and the impact  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:46):**  that it may or may not have on some soil and plant ecosystems?  Sure thing, John.  My journey took many years.  And in fact, it's still ongoing.  But I began working in this profession  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:02):**  back in the 80s and actually 70s as a graduate student.  And at that time, I was totally focused  on learning more about the processes that  lead to the loss of fertilizer nitrogen  and reduce its effectiveness for increasing yield.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:24):**  That's where my focus was.  I did my graduate work related to that view.  And at that point, I got involved  in using isotopic nitrogen as a tracer.  That's N15.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:39):**  But again, the emphasis was always  on minimizing the loss of fertilizer N  to increase its availability for crop uptake.  It was always from that perspective.  And in fact, it's not surprising because that's  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:55):**  the perspective that was so prevalent in the literature.  The concern was always about how do we reduce  the loss of the fertilizer.  Beginning in the 1990s, I began to come to a different view,  collaborating with my colleague Saeed Khan.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:20):**  We were working on nitrogen back at that time.  And we had some connection to a PhD project  here in Illinois that was finding  that there were quite a number of on-farm sites in the state  where there was no statistically significant yield response  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:45):**  by corn to fertilizer nitrogen.  That's not supposed to happen.  It's not supposed to.  I had been taught, and I hate to admit it, but I actually,  at one time, had actually taught this in my classes,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:02):**  that the optimal rate of fertilizer nitrogen  is easily calculated by multiplying  1.2 times an expected yield goal and then deducting  nitrogen credits like manure or a previous legume.  That was the standard way that nitrogen rates  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:21):**  were recommended in this state and, in fact, in many others.  It was a yield-based approach.  And I had never given that approach a whole lot of thought.  But I had to begin wondering about this  when those non-responsive sites showed up.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:43):**  And in fact, there were quite a few  of those non-responsive sites.  Out of 75 site years that were studied in that PhD project,  I believe there were 33 that showed  no significant response to N. It's quite a proportion.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:03):**  Just for some context, did these areas  that were non-responsive, did they have strong yields?  What were the yields like in these areas?  Yes.  And what would typically happen in those sites  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:17):**  is that the unfertilized yield or the check yield  would be very high and would not be increased significantly  by any application of fertilizer nitrogen.  That was the typical pattern.  That's enough to give some fertilizer executives  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:33):**  heartburn, I imagine.  I imagine it was.  And so that was kind of a wake-up call for Said and myself.  And it was giving us a different view  that this 1.2 calculation may not be quite so reliable  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:51):**  as we had assumed it was.  In fact, it led to a total change in thinking on our part.  But that took a while to happen.  So by about the year 2000, we were engaged in a project  to try and chemically characterize  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:11):**  some of those non-responsive sites  as compared to responsive sites that had been  studied in that PhD project.  We had the soil samples, and we were chemically analyzing them.  And that brought the first revelation to my thinking  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:29):**  that there was something far more wrong here  than I had ever realized.  And the problems began with the analytical methods  used to characterize organic soil in.  I had worked with two of the big names in that area who  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:45):**  developed those methods.  And it came as a bit of a shock to find out  that they didn't work.  And they didn't work.  Yes.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:58):**  So the methods that we had based our chemical characterizations  on turned out not to be reliable or quantitative.  And Said and I went to work reinventing  those methods with a very different approach.  And that took us about a year to do.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:17):**  Let me preface that progress by telling you  that when we had started that work,  to look at the comparison of responsive and non-responsive  soils collected in that PhD study,  we had found no differences.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:34):**  That the responsive soil looked just  like the non-responsive soils.  And that, in fact, was very consistent with what  had been seen years before when those fractionation  methods had been applied to other soils and other studies.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:51):**  Everything looked about the same.  So I talked with my wife at that point.  And she made the very interesting comment that,  well, now isn't that interesting?  You soil scientists are saying that the soil organic matter  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:11):**  is made up of, of course, carbon and nitrogen.  And that the carbon coming from plant materials,  it's all different.  It's very heterogeneous.  So you have simple sugars and proteins  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:22):**  and cellulose and hemicellulose and lignin and all that.  And those constituents are very different in their rate  of decomposition by the microbes.  They're different.  For example, the simple sugars and proteins go very quickly.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:43):**  And the lignin is the last.  They're all different.  But she told me, you know, now when it comes to nitrogen,  you guys are saying it's all the same.  And she was right.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:58):**  That's what the textbooks had said.  There's no fraction that is more decomposable than any other  in terms of N. And that's what we were finding  with the beginning of our work to compare those responsive  and nonresponsive sites.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:14):**  And then you need to realize that the plants had  seen a difference.  The plants at the nonresponsive sites did not need fertilizer.  They got all they needed from the soil.  I'm talking about nitrogen. And the ones  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:35):**  at the responsive sites did need fertilizer.  The soils were different.  There must be a chemical difference.  But the methods we were using did not detect it.  They were flawed.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:51):**  So as I said, Said and I set out to work  to develop methods that would replace those and make  it possible for us to characterize  that organic soil in.  We did that.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:04):**  And it took about a year, as I said.  And then we began to apply the new methods that were based  on a process called diffusion.  We applied those methods to, again,  some of those same soil samples comparing  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:21):**  responsive and nonresponsive sites.  And lo and behold, a pattern emerged.  I never expected to see it.  I believed my former professors, what they had written,  the textbooks, and so forth said there's no difference.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:40):**  But there was a difference.  And I can still recall Said coming in one Monday morning  and saying, I found a difference.  And so out of the fractions that we had analyzed,  there was only one that showed a clear separation  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:01):**  of responsive and nonresponsive soils.  The nonresponsive soils were all testing higher  than the responsive soils.  And that fraction is one that is typically referred  to as amino sugar nitrogen.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:22):**  OK.  That was a radical change in thinking for me.  I realized that something else I had been taught over the years.  This is a great fallacy.  The fallacy is that the fertilizer  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:44):**  is the main source of nitrogen for crop uptake.  I'm talking especially about corn.  And the soil, with the process of mineralization,  is only minor.  That the soil supplies some nitrogen,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:01):**  but it's pretty minor in terms of the quantity.  And the fertilizer is the dominant source.  That idea was totally consistent with that 1.2 method  of n-recommendation, which emphasized  the importance of the fertilizer.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:16):**  Same idea.  And now, lo and behold, we discovered that soils differ.  Some of them have a lot more of that amino sugar fraction  and presumably can supply more nitrogen for the crop,  even to the point where they no longer need any fertilizer.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:40):**  Wow.  That was a total transformation of my thinking.  From that time on, I was never able to go back  to the 1.2 idea.  I could not believe in that anymore.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:51):**  Well, there are many farmers and many agronomists  who have observed and have experienced,  in-field experiences, where they, as you identified,  there is no correlation between the measured soil nitrogen  as measured by typical historical lab analysis.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:09):**  There's no correlation between those measured nitrogen levels  and actual crop response to apply nitrogen.  No.  So I think that's becoming a more mainstream awareness.  But I'd like to further unwrap what  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:25):**  you described as the fallacy that fertilizer  is the main source of nutrients, particularly  nitrogen in corn in this case.  So if fertilizer is not the main source,  and amino sugars are the main source,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:40):**  or I should say, perhaps, in more broadly general soil  biology and biologically derived nutrients,  what proportion of the applied nitrogen  is actually delivered to the crop?  Well, typically, and again, I'm going back  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:52):**  to the isotope N15, which we've done quite a lot of work with,  and others have too.  And over and over and over again,  that isotope will tell us, we weren't listening back  in the earlier days, but the data are there.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:10):**  And they're telling us that typically, the soil, which  would be the unlabeled N that ends up in the crop,  that would typically supply, again, it varies,  but typically on the order of at least 2 thirds of the N  in that crop at harvest.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:32):**  Wow.  At least 2 thirds.  And with one of those nonresponsive soils  I was mentioning, I mean, it could be close to 100%.  So on these nonresponsive soils, applying nitrogen fertilizer  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:45):**  is a completely old way to run it.  Yes, that's what it means, that the crop didn't need it,  and the farmer should not have applied.  That's really enough to upset the fruit  basket in a really significant way for mainstream agronomy.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:01):**  Well, we found that was the case too.  And so it gets, there's one more aspect to that 1.2 method  I need to mention, because this is something  we didn't know back in 2000.  And in fact, it took several more years for us  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:21):**  to begin to understand this.  But it so happens that the 1.2 method comes from,  at least in Illinois, it comes from university research trials  that had been conducted in the late 60s.  And those trials were directed toward optimizing economically  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:42):**  the N fertilizer rate for corn.  But a really important point about this  is that those trials had been designed,  as I said, on university research fields,  as static plot studies.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:02):**  That's very important.  And I now emphasize that in my fertility class.  The trials were laid out, and the data  were collected in multiple years at the same sites.  And when I say static plots, I mean  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:16):**  that a given plot area in that study  received the same fertilizer treatment year after year.  That's especially important for the unfertilized treatment.  So the unfertilized treatment gets no input of fertilizer,  and it grows corn that removes the nutrients every year.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:42):**  There's no replacement.  The soil is being depleted, being mined.  But more importantly for nitrogen  is the fact that the carbon inputs coming  from the residues, those are going  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:58):**  to be broken down by the microbes.  But in so doing, the microbes need and must have nitrogen.  Has to.  They're going to take it up from the soil.  They're going to deprive the next crop of nitrogen.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:14):**  And they're going to depress the yield.  That's what's going to happen.  And so in a static plot study, you  accentuate the value of the fertilizer  by depleting the soil.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:30):**  I hope that makes sense.  That is very clear.  And it's in alignment, again, with the experiences  of many agronomists and growers we've  had conversations with who have totally debunked the 1.2  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:44):**  number on their own operations, where there are now  many growers who are growing really great crops,  in some cases with no applied nitrogen,  and in some cases with applied nitrogen  on the order of 0.4 to 5 pounds per bushel of nitrogen  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:58):**  credits.  Absolutely.  And so let me make one more point  about that static plot design.  So the 1.2 method had been developed  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:08):**  on the basis of that design.  It made the fertilizer look better than it should have.  And then that 1.2 method was applied to farmer fields.  The farmer fields were not managed or fertilized  according to static plots.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:26):**  There was never an unfertilized area  that was left year after year.  Never.  And so in that PhD study I mentioned,  where they had found these nonresponsive sites on farmer  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:41):**  fields, lo and behold, we came to realize, well,  that's in large part due to the fact  they developed the 1.2 method on static plots,  and now they take it to the real world of farm fields,  and the soil supplies much more in than the method recommended.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:02):**  It's exactly what you'd expect.  Yeah.  This finding is obviously quite remarkable.  What you're describing is that 33 out of 75 locations  are nonresponsive, 100% of the nitrogen  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:14):**  is being supplied from the soil, not from applied fertilizer.  And in the remaining 40-some plots, approximately 66%  of the nitrogen in the crop at harvest  is still coming from soil, which means only 33%  is coming from applied fertilizer.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:29):**  Yes, and so let me make one more point about the 1.2 method.  And that was it had an underlying assumption that  was not obvious, and we didn't realize it for many years,  but finally dug it out.  And the assumption behind the whole thing  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:44):**  was that 1 third of the nitrogen was  assumed to come from the soil and 2 thirds  from the fertilizer.  It's upside down.  Understanding that it's upside down,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:00):**  what is the real world scenario, and how  do we optimize what actually happens in the real world?  If it's the case that 66% to 100% of the nitrogen  within a crop can come from organically derived nitrogen  that is in the soil, perhaps amino sugars,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:19):**  I personally would love to learn more about amino sugars.  And then how can we optimize that?  How can we develop more amino sugars in our soil profiles?  OK, so as we gained an understanding  that the soil really is the major source of nitrogen  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:37):**  for crop uptake, it just stands to reason  that you should test the soil if that's the main source in order  to determine how much fertilizer you might need to apply.  And that's where we went.  So we developed the Illinois soil nitrogen  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:57):**  test that was an estimate of this so-called amino sugar  fraction.  And then that was oriented toward variable rate nitrogen.  Soils differ not only between farms,  but even within the same field.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:22):**  There were entrepreneurs in the private sector  that began to use this kind of a test  and still do use it for variable rate and recommendations.  So that the soil testing higher in this fraction  gets a lower fertilizer rate and vice versa.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:44):**  That's where it went.  And that's where it still needs to go.  Where is this soil assay, the Illinois soil nitrogen test,  where is this available?  What laboratories make it available to growers  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:55):**  at this point?  One of the labs that runs it is actually  headed by a former student of mine.  And we're doing on-farm research in conjunction with them  on several projects this year.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:07):**  But they routinely run this Illinois end  test to do variable rate end.  And the firm's name is CropSmith.  Tim Smith is the lead agronomist there.  CropSmith is the firm.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:22):**  Awesome.  Thank you for sharing that.  Yeah.  So what exactly are amino sugars?  What proportion of the total nitrogen that  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:31):**  is delivered from the soil is coming from amino sugars?  What are amino sugars?  And how do we develop more of them?  OK, amino sugars, like other organic forms of nitrogen,  are products of microbial activity.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:47):**  They're biologically synthesized.  And they occur in various microbial constituents,  like microbial cell walls.  They occur in spores.  And they also occur in the material called chitin.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:06):**  We think of insect exoskeletons are made of chitin.  Now, I'm not saying that the chitin is easily broken down.  But I do believe that those other forms of amino sugars,  namely bacterial cell walls, I think  those are quite a bit more decomposable.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:31):**  And there's another fraction that  contributes to this amino sugar in, which actually  isn't amino sugar.  It occurs in the form of two essential amino acids.  Those amino acids are asparagine and glutamine.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:51):**  And they contain two nitrogen atoms, not one,  not just in the amino group, but in an amide group  on the end of the chain.  And that amide group is prone to break down.  And it would be estimated by this Illinois soil end  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:09):**  test, as well as things like glucosamine or galactosamine  that occur in those bacterial cell walls.  So that's a partial answer to what you raised.  The question of how much of the organic nitrogen in soils  occurs in this form, the textbooks  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:31):**  tell us 5% to 10% of soil organic end  is in the form of amino sugars.  Considering that those estimates come from the classic methods  that we found were not accurate, I'm  inclined to think that the proportion is actually  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:51):**  higher than that.  We've never done our own study to fractionate it and compare  the fractions.  But I do wonder if that number has been on the low side.  Probably reasonable to expect that the fraction  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:07):**  of total nitrogen that is represented  by these amino sugars will also vary  based on the degree of soil biological health and activity.  Exactly.  And so this amino sugar fraction has  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:21):**  gained some traction as a parameter related  to what is a term I don't like all that much,  but here it is, soil health.  And I'm thinking of Salvita and Wilbrinton.  And we've been in contact with them.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:38):**  We've done some work with them.  He has a SLAN test that is another form of the Illinois  soil end test.  And it's targeting this amino sugar fraction.  And so I totally agree with your statement.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:53):**  Yes, the more biological activity you have in the soil,  you'd expect this fraction to be increased.  I find your comment particularly intriguing  about the source of amino sugars and your comments  about a significant portion of these sugars  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:08):**  possibly coming from cell membranes.  I've been delighted recently to discover Dr. James White's  research from Rutgers University where  he describes what is termed as the rhizophagy process where  growing root tips are absorbing or internalizing  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:29):**  entire microbial cells in large quantities  and are internally within the growing root tips,  they are exposing these bacteria and other organisms  as well, but particularly bacteria, to superoxide  and stripping the cell membranes.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:46):**  And then some of those bacteria, the entire bacterial cells  are consumed.  And a few of them survive the process  and are then transmitted back out through the root hairs  back into the soil environment along with root exudates  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:59):**  that stimulate the reformation of their cell membrane.  So the rhizophagy process is essentially  a description of plant roots stripping off  the cell membranes of all these organisms, which  you are describing.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:14):**  It gives them a source of amino sugars.  Yes.  So again, to clarify, the amino sugar fraction  that I'm aware of in terms of its location  is in the cell walls.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:28):**  It's in the cell walls.  But again, that would be the outer external part  of the bacteria.  And yes, it would be stripped off, yes.  Fascinating connection.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:38):**  So now we come to the important part for us as farmers  and for those of us who might have soils  but don't have soils in Illinois that don't offer nitrogen  response.  We have many soils in various parts of the world  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:54):**  that do offer significant nitrogen response.  How can we build the profiles of amino sugars  in our soil profile?  There's a growing awareness of the need for cover crops  and to have constantly green growing plants  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:08):**  and to incorporate manure and livestock and so forth.  I think that's a solid foundation  that many of our listeners have as a starting point.  So let me perhaps refine the question a little bit to say,  can we accelerate the development of amino sugars  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:24):**  with applied nitrogen?  Does applied nitrogen remain in the soil profile  and contributes to an increase in the biologically available  nitrogen?  OK, when you say applied nitrogen,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:34):**  you're referring to synthetic fertilizer nitrogen?  That's correct.  OK.  Yeah, that opens the door to another topic.  But before we go there, let me make the comment  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:49):**  that the increase in this so-called amino sugar nitrogen  fraction, I say so-called because it's  a mixture of different chemical forms,  as I think I tried to explain.  And a better term and one that's more chemically descriptive  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:09):**  would be alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen.  And that's how the Illinois Soil and Test estimates it.  But the issue is, how can that fraction  be increased in the soil?  There I'd make a couple comments.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:25):**  And one is that in the early work,  as we came to realize the importance of that fraction  and its presence, we were finding that many times soils  that had been maneuvered had high levels of this so-called  amino sugar fraction.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:49):**  And so one point I would make is that maneuvering a soil  can enrich it in that fraction.  And that seems to make a lot of sense,  because manured soils supply more in  and have less need for synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:05):**  So that's one point.  The second point is about the cover crops you mentioned.  Now, we haven't done, my lab hasn't done any work  on cover crops.  But just as a general discussion point,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:18):**  I would raise the issue that if you have a growing active plant  that's present, that plant is increasing microbial activities  and populations.  And it stands to reason that as it does that,  it's going to be increasing this so-called amino sugar  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:40):**  fraction, because that fraction is  connected with those microbes.  And if you have more microbes and they're more active  in the rhizosphere, for example, you  should be enriching the soil in that fraction.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:54):**  So those two points I would raise about potential ways  to increase the soil's content of amino sugar in.  Now, onto the other point.  And this, too, was a major revelation for us,  and certainly for me in particular.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:13):**  We have here at the University of Illinois  the oldest continuous research plots in North America.  They're called the Morrill plots,  and they date back to 18, as I recall now, I want to say 68.  But it might be 1875 or so.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:39):**  A long time, in other words.  Yeah, so we've been going at this for nearly 150 years now.  It's getting there.  Yeah, actually it was 1876.  So those plots get cropped year after year after year.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:56):**  And these days, well, when I say these days,  I'm referring to the years since 1967.  There have been three rotations in those plots.  Continuous corn, which dates back to 1876.  Corn-soybean rotation, which dates to 1967,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:19):**  before then it was corn oats.  And then corn oats hay, alfalfa hay.  And that, too, goes back to 1876.  So we have long-term experiments in place.  And by the way, these are all, of course, static plots.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:38):**  We can't have a new Morrill plots every year.  So it's the same ground, same treatments on the same plots.  Now, the interesting thing is, again,  my colleague Syed Khan comes into the picture.  He had been a student here back in the 80s.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:55):**  And we worked together beginning in 1993.  And he had noticed, well, the textbook message  addresses the point that you raised,  that applying this synthetic nitrogen  is going to help build soil organic matter  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:18):**  by supplying one of the key essential elements  in that organic matter, nitrogen.  So it's kind of like a recipe for building organic matter.  So Syed had noticed over the course of the years  that the continuous corn in the Morrill plots  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:42):**  just didn't look as healthy.  And it wasn't giving the yields of corn oats hay  when that was growing corn.  The plants were clearly different.  They were larger and darker green on corn oats hay  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:01):**  and smaller and lighter green on continuous corn.  Despite the fact that the continuous corn plots  were getting on the order of three times  the nitrogen from fertilizer.  Now, if the fertilizer is building organic matter,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:20):**  you would think that the continuous corn would  have more organic matter than corn oats hay.  It was getting three times the nitrogen.  So it could get more biomass.  And it was much more biomass.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:39):**  But we had the opportunity to analyze the organic matter  and the Illinois soil end test on the Morrill plots.  And lo and behold, both properties  were considerably lower for continuous corn  than for corn oats hay.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:05):**  It really cast doubt on the idea that  those fertilizers were building organic matter.  So that led us to a large project.  And it led to two papers and letters to the editor  and all kinds of exchanges.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:27):**  The gist of all this, when we compared  the change in organic matter for the different rotations  in the Morrill plots, and when we sampled  from each of those rotations the unfertilized subplot  and the fertilized subplot, well, my goodness,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:53):**  what do you suppose we found?  We compared archival samples that we had access to,  collected in 1955 or 67, to samples  that we collected in 2005.  And lo and behold, we found there  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:15):**  was no increase in organic matter  on the fertilized subplots.  But in fact, and especially in the subsurface horizon,  there was a significant decrease.  All that fertilizer did not build organic matter.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:36):**  In fact, it burned it.  You mentioned a very key word, it burned it.  And I think this is the aspect that many people miss  when they consider conventional fertilizer applications.  They don't consider, A, the oxidizing effect  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:53):**  that it has directly on soil microbial communities,  and B, the effect that it has on stimulating biology  to the point where you actually release carbon  dioxide from respiration.  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:06):**  That second point is especially critical.  And so let me explain it as best I can.  With most living forms on planet Earth, carbon and nitrogen  are intrinsically coupled.  It's true for us as well as microbes.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:27):**  So carbon and nitrogen have to come together.  We have to have both.  But you know, carbon is the principal commodity for life  because it generates both energy and carbon  for producing biomass.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:52):**  It's essential.  So the microbes in soil have a keen interest  in organic carbon.  It's how they make their living.  And so when crop residues are returned to the soil,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:07):**  those microbes take an immediate interest.  An opportunity presents itself.  But they can only take advantage of it if they have nitrogen  because carbon metabolism is, of course, an enzymatic process.  And every enzyme contains nitrogen.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:36):**  So they can't use that carbon unless they have nitrogen.  So we return the residues.  And if we also give them nitrogen, they are in business.  And once they are in business, what happens to the nitrogen?  And what happens to the carbon?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:54):**  So now they're going to be stimulated  to use more of that carbon.  They're going to attack the residues first  because those are more decomposable.  Their chemistry is such that they're more easily attacked.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:14):**  I talked earlier about the different forms of carbon,  things like simple sugars, proteins, et cetera.  So they can attack those more easily.  And they will.  They take the easy stuff first.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:28):**  And if you stimulate them by applying fertilizer in,  they do it that much better.  But if they still have available nitrogen  after they've exhausted the residues,  well, they're just going to look for other sources of carbon.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:47):**  And lo and behold, there's the organic matter.  And that's why they attack it.  If you give microbes nitrogen, they want carbon.  If you give them carbon, they want nitrogen.  They always require those two in the balance.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:06):**  Yep, exactly.  So their C to N ratio is on the order of 7 or 8 to 1,  7 carbon to 1 nitrogen. And so they're  in the business of making other things look like themselves.  That's what they do.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:24):**  They burn off the excess carbon.  So this means, in essence, yeah, that's exactly it.  This means, in essence, that when  you supply more nitrogen than is required for residue digestion  or any time the soil has pre-leveled the nitrogen,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:41):**  applied synthetic fertilizer nitrogen,  then that is going to result in the off-gassing of carbon  dioxide.  So in fact, adding nitrogen means  you deplete organic matter, not build it.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:53):**  In fact, that's exactly what we came to realize.  And along the way, we became aware of papers  published long before we got into that topic.  I'm thinking of one published by a guy named William Albrecht.  It's very interesting.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:15):**  It was a paper I never heard of in any class I ever took.  Back in 1938, he published that paper.  It came from Sanborn Field at Columbia, Missouri.  Now, this gets interesting, and I always  share this story with my class.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:33):**  So Albrecht, he actually is an alumnus  of the University of Illinois.  He got four degrees here.  And then he went to Missouri, and that's  where he spent his career.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:49):**  Well, in 1938, William Albrecht published  two papers on this subject.  The first came out in a handbook from the USDA  called Soils and Men.  And in that chapter, he gives this conventional textbook  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:10):**  message that in order to build organic matter,  you must have adequate nitrogen.  Then later that year, he published a different message.  And it was in an article that was  published in the South Science Society of America Proceedings.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:32):**  And it came from data he had collected from Sanborn Field.  And it was under, I believe, continuous wheat.  Now, Sanborn Field was started later than the Morrill Plots.  Morrill Plots in 1876.  Sanborn Field was started in 1888.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:56):**  But the guys who set up Sanborn Field  were more forward thinking than the Morrill Plots guys.  And from the first year, they included a treatment  with synthetic nitrogen. Back then, it was ammonium sulfate.  So the years began to add up.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:17):**  And in 1914, they had completed their first 25 years.  And I don't think Albrecht was there at that time,  but the plots had been sampled and the samples had been kept.  Albrecht was there after the next 25 years in 1938.  He did the sampling and he compared the organic matter,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:44):**  or actually organic carbon, in the fertilized and the unfertilized treatments,  comparing the 50th year and the 25th year.  And what do you suppose he found?  That the unfertilized plots had actually gained organic matter  and the fertilized had lost.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:08):**  And from that point on, he never again said  that you must have adequate nitrogen to build soil organic matter.  To his credit, he never again said that.  Now he was saying that fertilizer nitrogen burns the soil.  That's what he said.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:30):**  And our work with the Morrill Plots is entirely consistent with his statement.  Richard, this conversation around nitrogen has been illuminating and valuable.  I want to be considerate of our audience and your time.  And I want to change gears a little bit to a related group of research  that you published as well.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:54):**  You published several interesting papers titled The Potassium Paradox.  You made some waves with that.  I enjoy having conversations with people who make waves.  So I'd love to get into that a little bit,  tell us the story of how the Potassium Paradox came to be.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:09):**  Well, here again, my colleague Saeed Khan comes to the forefront.  In fact, Saeed was and still is the expert on that topic.  I've learned an immense amount from him working on it.  And what I now know, I pass on to my students,  and it's a very different message from the one that you'll find in the textbooks.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:33):**  Saeed had started working on potassium when he was an agronomist back in Pakistan.  And he has stories that are very interesting from that time.  I won't go into those here.  But he came to Illinois in the 80s to do first a master's and then a Ph.D. degree.  And for both degrees, he worked on potassium.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:58):**  And I happened to be on his graduate committee for the Ph.D.  It's embarrassing to think how ignorant I was of potassium back in those days.  Really quite ashamed of it.  But there were many stones left unturned.  Saeed had been involved in a project in which he did soil testing for potassium  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:27):**  every two weeks at what we call the South Farm here just off campus.  So he was sampling the same plots throughout the year every two weeks.  That was the gist of his thesis.  The data were all over the place.  It was amazing how this test varied.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:50):**  That makes for a challenging thesis.  Indeed it did.  And back then, he didn't know the whole story.  And of course, I didn't have a clue.  But one of the trends that he documented in that thesis work was that the unfertilized plots,  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:08):**  over the course of those four years he did this,  they were increasing in their average potassium levels.  They were increasing.  He was testing the surface plow layer down to about seven inches.  And he was seeing an increase in those unfertilized plots.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:28):**  Now, why would this be?  And he came to realize, well, it's the soil.  And he had many more data coming from various lab tests that were in his thesis.  And they all tell a story in which they're saying the soil is releasing potassium.  Oh, my.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:52):**  You know, there's a lot of potassium in soils.  About 40,000 pounds per acre in the top six inches of many midwestern soils.  In the top six inches.  And if you go down through the profile, or at least through the rooting depth,  you're talking about half a million pounds, typically in a prairie soil like we have in much of Illinois.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:12):**  It's a humongous amount.  Well, it does seem like the crop would take note that it's in a sea of potassium.  And so, as we got into that potassium paradox project,  mainly what we spent our time doing was collecting and reviewing a lot of potassium studies.  I mean, a lot.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:39):**  We had 500 references in that paper.  Well, over and over again, many of those studies, and especially in places like Illinois,  would show no significant yield increase from cave fertilization.  That would be common trend.  Especially for grain production, but even for forage production.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:07):**  That would often be the case.  Wow.  So, naturally, you begin to wonder, why are farmers using all this potash fertilizer?  And believe me, when Said gave a talk at the National No-Till Conference back several years ago,  there was a lot of interest in his message, both from the farmers and the fertilizer industry.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:37):**  Exactly.  I anticipate there were different emotional reactions from different audiences.  There were indeed.  And so, in that paper, we've been a great deal of effort documenting that there was often no response in terms of yield to potash.  And we also went into great detail about changes in the soil test.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:01):**  And we did a lot of balanced documenting in different places throughout the world.  And over and over again, you'd see that there was an increase in exchangeable K without fertilization.  That's common because the K is coming out from the clay.  That's where it is.  And so it builds up.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:24):**  And then we came to realize another really important part of this.  And I didn't know anything about this until we did that project.  The crop grows and it extracts K by its roots.  Well, what's going on there?  Potassium is in the clay.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:44):**  That's the key fraction.  And there's more clay in the subsoil than there is in the plow layer.  So as the plant builds its root system and begins to exploit the subsoil, my gosh, it has a lot of access to potassium.  And it takes it up.  And as it takes it up, it's going to transport it.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:10):**  A lot of it ends up in the above-ground plant material.  Now, what happens there?  Another important point that I learned from Said.  The potassium is always in inorganic forms.  It's never organic.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:29):**  So in the plant, like in the soil, it stays inorganic.  It's just salts.  That's all it is.  And a lot of the K in plant material ends up as carbonate.  Potassium carbonate.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:45):**  Now, what happens here?  The plant grows that above-ground biomass.  At the end of the growing season, the harvest is going typically to leave that biomass with a grain crop.  It's left on the surface.  The rainfall leaches the salts out of the residue.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:07):**  And here again, an important point.  Potassium is the major plant cation.  There's a lot of K salts in the residue.  In fact, for a crop like corn, the residue has three times the potassium content of the grain.  Most of the K is going to be recycled.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:29):**  And just last week, I learned another interesting lesson about this.  Potassium carbonate.  We had some plots that had to be fertilized with potassium.  Not because they needed it, but because we had to satisfy the reviewers.  And we didn't want to use a source that would have salt burn, like muriata potash, KCL.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:53):**  High salt index.  We didn't want this.  So my graduate student and I came up with the idea that why don't we use potassium carbonate?  Can't possibly hurt the plant.  Because it's in the plant.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:06):**  What we discovered when we did some checking on properties and then made a solution,  this potassium carbonate is tremendously soluble.  So that brought reality to my thinking that on a point that Said had often told me,  potassium just leaches out of the plant.  When it rains, potassium leaches out of the plant, drips from the leaves.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:33):**  You can't stop this stuff.  And so it comes back to the soil, but it's on the surface now.  Now just think of this.  When soil testers go out to test for potash, like for pH, they typically just sample the plow layer.  Because it's easier to sample.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:57):**  And yet the plow layer is being enriched by the plant in potassium.  It's coming out of biomass.  And especially out of the residues.  So this comes back to the point I told you that the unfertilized soils showed an increase in K test values over time.  Because the K was coming from the residues.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:26):**  That's why they increased.  We've actually observed with in-field experience, particularly on no-till operations,  and particularly on those no-till soils where a lot of glyphosate is still used,  where greater than 90% of the total potassium that is measured in the top six or seven inches in the A horizon,  actually exists in the top one-half inch to one inch of the soil profile.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:51):**  So what you're describing is that the majority, and of course that potassium in that layer,  as soon as that layer dries out and is exposed to sunlight or is limited in moisture in the summer,  the potassium in that layer disappears in terms of plant availability.  Plants can't access it anymore.  Yes.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:08):**  And so now you're saying the other significant source of potassium is actually in the clay layer,  in the B horizon of the soil profile.  Yes, that's the storehouse.  And so on that fraction, let me make the point too.  Here we are with a cation in the form of potassium.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:25):**  It only has one positive charge, and it's competing for exchange sites with divalent calcium and magnesium.  They stick tighter because they have more charge.  And yet the irony is that potassium leaching losses are very low, very much lower than calcium.  Now why would that be, and this is another question I put to my class, now why would that be?  Why would it be that calcium would be so readily lost by leaching and potassium, hardly any?  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:06):**  It's because of the clay.  The potassium gets fixed in the clay, and calcium does not.  Potassium is the right size to go between the clay layers, and calcium is too big.  That's the reason.  So we've talked about potassium, the potassium paradox.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:26):**  You mentioned an important point that I can't avoid elaborating on a little bit.  So potassium is stored within the clay, within the clay platelets, but now we have to open another can of worms.  What happens when you have clay aging because of exposure to very strong oxidizing materials like, say, anhydrous ammonia?  Okay, so one of the biggest factors on the status of the clay and its storage of clay is wetting and drying.  So when the clays dry, they expand.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:00):**  They open up, and the clay comes out from between the layers.  When they get wet, they swell, and they close up.  It traps the clay.  So wetting and drying is one of the most important factors, and that's been known for a very long time.  But, you know, the thing is that I didn't realize, I don't think Said did in his early studies, is how dynamic that clay fixed K is.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:29):**  The textbook tells us, oh, that's pretty inert.  It's not available to plants.  Hogwash.  That fixed K fraction is resupplying the exchangeable K.  It's a very dynamic and rapid process.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:48):**  It's tied to moisture.  And in fact, it even impacts the clay-bearing minerals.  That's a huge reservoir in soils.  And we came across a study in Germany, a very interesting study by a guy named Mengele.  And he had done a greenhouse study in which he had removed the fine fraction, the clay fraction, from the potting mixture.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:19):**  And he was growing plants on just sand and coarse silt.  And he measured the K uptake, and it was substantial.  So we get the idea that, oh, this K in those minerals between the clay layers, it just can't come out.  It does.  And part of it is because the plant itself knows how to get it.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:44):**  So plant roots produce acidity, partly through respiration, making carbonic acid.  And the acids attack the minerals, and they dissolve the K out of there.  The plant takes up the minerals, the mineral K.  So those fractions are not inert.  They are actively feeding the plant.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:08):**  And so the K testers come along, they measure a fraction called exchangeable.  And they say, oh, this is what's available for the crop to use, and there's not much of it, so we need to fertilize.  And the truth is, it's the tip of the iceberg because the exchangeable fraction will be resupplied by non-exchangeable and mineral K.  There's a huge reservoir.  You're just seeing a snapshot of one tiny fraction means nothing because it's going to be resupplied.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:43):**  And that's a central point about K cycling.  There's so much in the soil.  One more point I should add here.  In the course of all this K paradox discussion and work that we did,  we came across a publication from this university back about 100 years ago, actually more than 100 years ago now.

And what was his message about potassium?  Published a bulletin on it.  He told farmers, you don't need it.  The soil is a K mine.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:33):**  And he got into a fight with the fertilizer industry.  Boy, history has a way of repeating itself.  Isn't it true?  Particularly in regards to picking a fight with the fertilizer industry.  I do think it's important, though, I don't want to lose sight of the question that I asked about clay aging.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:57):**  My understanding of clay aging is that there are some materials which are particularly effective at aging a clay.  Potassium chloride and anhydrous ammonia are pretty close to the top of the list in my understanding.  And what that means when they age a clay is that clay loses its swelling capacity and no longer expands and contracts.  So it no longer releases potassium. Is that correct?  Okay, now let's go into that a little bit more.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:23):**  So this business of shrinking and swelling is real important for the release of K from soil.  So in fact, what happens when you apply potash is that the potash is sucked into the clay.  In most soils, it's going to be pulled in. It's going to be fixed.  And when it gets fixed, it contracts the clay.  It collapses the clay layers.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:54):**  That's what it's going to do. It's going to lock them together.  And so by applying K, you actually reduce the capacity of the soil to supply K.  And not only that, you reduce the soil's cation exchange capacity because a lot of that is between the clay layers.  And applying K collapses the layers.  Seems like an excellent recipe for selling crop protection products.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:27):**  We'll just first damage the soil and then we will supply the solutions to treat the unhealthy crops that now grow on these damaged soils.  Let me give you just a brief story that we heard from the guys at Growers Mineral Solutions.  They talked about a field in Ohio where it tested low for K and the order went out to the local fertilizer dealer that they needed to apply K.  And so the truck went out, the K was applied, and they made the mistake of retesting the field.  And what do you think they found? The K test was lower than it had been.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:12):**  And so the manager at the fertilizer plant got on the driver and said,  Why, you dummy, you went to the wrong field. Go out and do it again. Well, he didn't go to the wrong field.  He went back to the same field and put more K on, and they retested it again, and the K went down more.  Wow, that's impressive.  That's what it can do.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:43):**  So, Richard, in conclusion, in summary, what would your advice be to growers for nitrogen and potassium management?  How would you approach it?  For nitrogen, again, it goes back to the point that the soil is the main source.  So if at all possible, I would encourage farmers to use something like the Illinois N test.  I'm not talking about nitrate testing now. Nitrate comes, nitrate goes, it's dynamic.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:13):**  This Illinois N test fraction is much more stable, and you can map a field and then do variable rate N.  In my view, that is a very good approach for managing N.  More work is needed to better calibrate the test, but it certainly can help give a grower an idea about what his soil can supply.  In regards to potassium, what Said and I recommended in that paper was because soil K testing just doesn't work.  The best approach, if there's a concern that there might be a need for K fertilization, do strip trials.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:59):**  So drop off to no K, compare it with some low K rates, and don't go high in the K rate because it'll never give that kind of response.  It'll just be a low amount if any is needed.  And we also recommended that if possible, it would be better not to use myriated potash, but instead the sulfate.  And that gets into the issue about chloride versus sulfate, or sulfate's nutrient, chloride is not,  and chloride competes with nitrate for plant uptake, not good in terms of N fertility.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:38):**  So those were our recommendations for N and K.  Thank you. What resources would you recommend to growers if they wanted to learn more about these conversations?  There's obviously the papers that you have co-authored with Said and others, which we will link in the show notes for all of our listeners.  Are there any other recommendations for those who want to learn more that you would recommend?  Well, offhand as I sit here, I'm just thinking maybe one possibility would be to contact a company like CropSmith.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:07):**  I'm not saying they're the only one, but they know the value of optimizing the soil as the source of nutrients.  And that fertilizer rates could be much lower than many growers use.  So CropSmith would be one source. Another guy that is aware of this message and writes about it would be Ken Ferry from the Farm Journal.  Ken loses the Illinois N test for variable rate N, and he's aware that the soil is the main source.  Wonderful. Richard, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and your knowledge.

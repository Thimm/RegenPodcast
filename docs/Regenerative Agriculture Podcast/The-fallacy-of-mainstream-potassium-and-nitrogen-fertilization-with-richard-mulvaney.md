**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:01):**  Welcome back to the Regenative Agriculture podcast.  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:04):**  Today I'm here with a soil scientist and researcher  
**[0:00:08-0:00:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:08):**  who I've heard quite a bit about, Richard Mulvaney  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:10):**  from the University of Illinois in Urbana.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:14):**  Richard has done some interesting work  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:15):**  looking at nitrogen and potassium in soil profiles  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:19):**  and the value that we get out of fertilization,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:22):**  and also trying to better understand those environments  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:25):**  where fertilization may be less necessary  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:29):**  or not produce the crop response that we anticipate.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:33):**  So Richard, I'd love to hear more of your story  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:36):**  and your background.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:37):**  Can you tell us how you came to this space and the journey that  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:42):**  brought you to looking at fertilization and the impact  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:46):**  that it may or may not have on some soil and plant ecosystems?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:50):**  Sure thing, John.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:51):**  My journey took many years.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:55):**  And in fact, it's still ongoing.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:00:57):**  But I began working in this profession  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:02):**  back in the 80s and actually 70s as a graduate student.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:07):**  And at that time, I was totally focused  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:11):**  on learning more about the processes that  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:16):**  lead to the loss of fertilizer nitrogen  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:20):**  and reduce its effectiveness for increasing yield.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:24):**  That's where my focus was.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:26):**  I did my graduate work related to that view.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:30):**  And at that point, I got involved  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:33):**  in using isotopic nitrogen as a tracer.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:37):**  That's N15.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:39):**  But again, the emphasis was always  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:41):**  on minimizing the loss of fertilizer N  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:46):**  to increase its availability for crop uptake.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:50):**  It was always from that perspective.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:52):**  And in fact, it's not surprising because that's  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:01:55):**  the perspective that was so prevalent in the literature.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:00):**  The concern was always about how do we reduce  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:03):**  the loss of the fertilizer.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:05):**  Beginning in the 1990s, I began to come to a different view,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:17):**  collaborating with my colleague Saeed Khan.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:20):**  We were working on nitrogen back at that time.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:23):**  And we had some connection to a PhD project  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:29):**  here in Illinois that was finding  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:34):**  that there were quite a number of on-farm sites in the state  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:39):**  where there was no statistically significant yield response  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:45):**  by corn to fertilizer nitrogen.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:50):**  That's not supposed to happen.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:52):**  It's not supposed to.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:54):**  I had been taught, and I hate to admit it, but I actually,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:02:58):**  at one time, had actually taught this in my classes,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:02):**  that the optimal rate of fertilizer nitrogen  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:06):**  is easily calculated by multiplying  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:11):**  1.2 times an expected yield goal and then deducting  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:15):**  nitrogen credits like manure or a previous legume.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:19):**  That was the standard way that nitrogen rates  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:21):**  were recommended in this state and, in fact, in many others.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:27):**  It was a yield-based approach.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:29):**  And I had never given that approach a whole lot of thought.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:35):**  But I had to begin wondering about this  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:39):**  when those non-responsive sites showed up.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:43):**  And in fact, there were quite a few  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:45):**  of those non-responsive sites.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:47):**  Out of 75 site years that were studied in that PhD project,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:54):**  I believe there were 33 that showed  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:03:57):**  no significant response to N. It's quite a proportion.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:03):**  Just for some context, did these areas  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:06):**  that were non-responsive, did they have strong yields?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:10):**  What were the yields like in these areas?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:13):**  And what would typically happen in those sites  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:17):**  is that the unfertilized yield or the check yield  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:21):**  would be very high and would not be increased significantly  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:25):**  by any application of fertilizer nitrogen.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:29):**  That was the typical pattern.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:31):**  That's enough to give some fertilizer executives  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:33):**  heartburn, I imagine.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:35):**  I imagine it was.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:37):**  And so that was kind of a wake-up call for Said and myself.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:43):**  And it was giving us a different view  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:46):**  that this 1.2 calculation may not be quite so reliable  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:51):**  as we had assumed it was.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:53):**  In fact, it led to a total change in thinking on our part.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:57):**  But that took a while to happen.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:04:59):**  So by about the year 2000, we were engaged in a project  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:06):**  to try and chemically characterize  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:11):**  some of those non-responsive sites  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:14):**  as compared to responsive sites that had been  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:17):**  studied in that PhD project.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:19):**  We had the soil samples, and we were chemically analyzing them.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:24):**  And that brought the first revelation to my thinking  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:29):**  that there was something far more wrong here  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:32):**  than I had ever realized.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:34):**  And the problems began with the analytical methods  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:37):**  used to characterize organic soil in.

**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:45):**  developed those methods.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:47):**  And it came as a bit of a shock to find out  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:52):**  that they didn't work.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:55):**  And they didn't work.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:05:58):**  So the methods that we had based our chemical characterizations  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:03):**  on turned out not to be reliable or quantitative.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:06):**  And Said and I went to work reinventing  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:11):**  those methods with a very different approach.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:14):**  And that took us about a year to do.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:17):**  Let me preface that progress by telling you  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:22):**  that when we had started that work,  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:25):**  to look at the comparison of responsive and non-responsive  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:28):**  soils collected in that PhD study,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:32):**  we had found no differences.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:34):**  That the responsive soil looked just  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:36):**  like the non-responsive soils.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:39):**  And that, in fact, was very consistent with what  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:43):**  had been seen years before when those fractionation  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:48):**  methods had been applied to other soils and other studies.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:51):**  Everything looked about the same.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:54):**  So I talked with my wife at that point.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:06:57):**  And she made the very interesting comment that,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:02):**  well, now isn't that interesting?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:04):**  You soil scientists are saying that the soil organic matter  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:11):**  is made up of, of course, carbon and nitrogen.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:13):**  And that the carbon coming from plant materials,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:16):**  it's all different.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:17):**  It's very heterogeneous.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:19):**  So you have simple sugars and proteins  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:22):**  and cellulose and hemicellulose and lignin and all that.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:26):**  And those constituents are very different in their rate  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:32):**  of decomposition by the microbes.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:35):**  They're different.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:37):**  For example, the simple sugars and proteins go very quickly.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:43):**  And the lignin is the last.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:46):**  They're all different.

**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:53):**  you guys are saying it's all the same.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:57):**  And she was right.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:07:58):**  That's what the textbooks had said.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:00):**  There's no fraction that is more decomposable than any other  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:04):**  in terms of N. And that's what we were finding  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:07):**  with the beginning of our work to compare those responsive

**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:14):**  And then you need to realize that the plants had  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:19):**  seen a difference.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:22):**  The plants at the nonresponsive sites did not need fertilizer.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:29):**  They got all they needed from the soil.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:32):**  I'm talking about nitrogen. And the ones  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:35):**  at the responsive sites did need fertilizer.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:39):**  The soils were different.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:41):**  There must be a chemical difference.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:45):**  But the methods we were using did not detect it.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:49):**  They were flawed.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:51):**  So as I said, Said and I set out to work  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:54):**  to develop methods that would replace those and make  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:08:58):**  it possible for us to characterize  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:01):**  that organic soil in.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:03):**  We did that.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:04):**  And it took about a year, as I said.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:07):**  And then we began to apply the new methods that were based  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:12):**  on a process called diffusion.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:15):**  We applied those methods to, again,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:17):**  some of those same soil samples comparing  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:21):**  responsive and nonresponsive sites.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:24):**  And lo and behold, a pattern emerged.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:30):**  I never expected to see it.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:33):**  I believed my former professors, what they had written,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:37):**  the textbooks, and so forth said there's no difference.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:40):**  But there was a difference.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:43):**  And I can still recall Said coming in one Monday morning  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:46):**  and saying, I found a difference.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:52):**  And so out of the fractions that we had analyzed,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:09:56):**  there was only one that showed a clear separation  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:01):**  of responsive and nonresponsive soils.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:05):**  The nonresponsive soils were all testing higher  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:10):**  than the responsive soils.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:13):**  And that fraction is one that is typically referred  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:17):**  to as amino sugar nitrogen.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:22):**  OK.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:25):**  That was a radical change in thinking for me.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:29):**  I realized that something else I had been taught over the years.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:36):**  This is a great fallacy.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:39):**  The fallacy is that the fertilizer  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:44):**  is the main source of nitrogen for crop uptake.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:48):**  I'm talking especially about corn.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:52):**  And the soil, with the process of mineralization,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:55):**  is only minor.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:10:58):**  That the soil supplies some nitrogen,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:01):**  but it's pretty minor in terms of the quantity.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:05):**  And the fertilizer is the dominant source.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:07):**  That idea was totally consistent with that 1.2 method  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:11):**  of n-recommendation, which emphasized  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:13):**  the importance of the fertilizer.

**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:18):**  And now, lo and behold, we discovered that soils differ.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:24):**  Some of them have a lot more of that amino sugar fraction  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:29):**  and presumably can supply more nitrogen for the crop,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:34):**  even to the point where they no longer need any fertilizer.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:40):**  Wow.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:42):**  That was a total transformation of my thinking.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:45):**  From that time on, I was never able to go back  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:47):**  to the 1.2 idea.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:49):**  I could not believe in that anymore.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:51):**  Well, there are many farmers and many agronomists  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:54):**  who have observed and have experienced,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:11:57):**  in-field experiences, where they, as you identified,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:01):**  there is no correlation between the measured soil nitrogen  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:05):**  as measured by typical historical lab analysis.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:09):**  There's no correlation between those measured nitrogen levels  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:11):**  and actual crop response to apply nitrogen.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:14):**  No.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:15):**  So I think that's becoming a more mainstream awareness.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:21):**  But I'd like to further unwrap what  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:25):**  you described as the fallacy that fertilizer  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:28):**  is the main source of nutrients, particularly  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:32):**  nitrogen in corn in this case.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:36):**  So if fertilizer is not the main source,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:38):**  and amino sugars are the main source,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:40):**  or I should say, perhaps, in more broadly general soil  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:43):**  biology and biologically derived nutrients,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:46):**  what proportion of the applied nitrogen  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:48):**  is actually delivered to the crop?  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:50):**  Well, typically, and again, I'm going back  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:52):**  to the isotope N15, which we've done quite a lot of work with,  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:57):**  and others have too.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:12:59):**  And over and over and over again,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:02):**  that isotope will tell us, we weren't listening back  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:07):**  in the earlier days, but the data are there.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:10):**  And they're telling us that typically, the soil, which  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:16):**  would be the unlabeled N that ends up in the crop,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:20):**  that would typically supply, again, it varies,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:23):**  but typically on the order of at least 2 thirds of the N  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:29):**  in that crop at harvest.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:32):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:32):**  At least 2 thirds.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:34):**  And with one of those nonresponsive soils  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:37):**  I was mentioning, I mean, it could be close to 100%.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:41):**  So on these nonresponsive soils, applying nitrogen fertilizer  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:45):**  is a completely old way to run it.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:47):**  Yes, that's what it means, that the crop didn't need it,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:51):**  and the farmer should not have applied.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:55):**  That's really enough to upset the fruit  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:13:57):**  basket in a really significant way for mainstream agronomy.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:01):**  Well, we found that was the case too.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:08):**  And so it gets, there's one more aspect to that 1.2 method  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:14):**  I need to mention, because this is something  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:16):**  we didn't know back in 2000.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:19):**  And in fact, it took several more years for us  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:21):**  to begin to understand this.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:24):**  But it so happens that the 1.2 method comes from,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:29):**  at least in Illinois, it comes from university research trials  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:34):**  that had been conducted in the late 60s.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:38):**  And those trials were directed toward optimizing economically  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:42):**  the N fertilizer rate for corn.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:45):**  But a really important point about this  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:48):**  is that those trials had been designed,  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:54):**  as I said, on university research fields,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:14:58):**  as static plot studies.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:02):**  That's very important.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:03):**  And I now emphasize that in my fertility class.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:07):**  The trials were laid out, and the data  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:09):**  were collected in multiple years at the same sites.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:13):**  And when I say static plots, I mean  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:16):**  that a given plot area in that study  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:20):**  received the same fertilizer treatment year after year.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:27):**  That's especially important for the unfertilized treatment.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:31):**  So the unfertilized treatment gets no input of fertilizer,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:36):**  and it grows corn that removes the nutrients every year.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:42):**  There's no replacement.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:43):**  The soil is being depleted, being mined.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:48):**  But more importantly for nitrogen  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:51):**  is the fact that the carbon inputs coming  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:55):**  from the residues, those are going  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:15:58):**  to be broken down by the microbes.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:00):**  But in so doing, the microbes need and must have nitrogen.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:07):**  Has to.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:08):**  They're going to take it up from the soil.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:09):**  They're going to deprive the next crop of nitrogen.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:14):**  And they're going to depress the yield.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:17):**  That's what's going to happen.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:19):**  And so in a static plot study, you  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:22):**  accentuate the value of the fertilizer  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:27):**  by depleting the soil.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:30):**  I hope that makes sense.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:33):**  That is very clear.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:34):**  And it's in alignment, again, with the experiences  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:37):**  of many agronomists and growers we've  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:39):**  had conversations with who have totally debunked the 1.2

**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:49):**  in some cases with no applied nitrogen,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:51):**  and in some cases with applied nitrogen  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:53):**  on the order of 0.4 to 5 pounds per bushel of nitrogen  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:58):**  credits.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:16:59):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:01):**  And so let me make one more point  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:02):**  about that static plot design.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:05):**  So the 1.2 method had been developed  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:08):**  on the basis of that design.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:10):**  It made the fertilizer look better than it should have.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:15):**  And then that 1.2 method was applied to farmer fields.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:20):**  The farmer fields were not managed or fertilized  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:24):**  according to static plots.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:26):**  There was never an unfertilized area  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:28):**  that was left year after year.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:31):**  Never.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:32):**  And so in that PhD study I mentioned,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:37):**  where they had found these nonresponsive sites on farmer  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:41):**  fields, lo and behold, we came to realize, well,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:46):**  that's in large part due to the fact  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:48):**  they developed the 1.2 method on static plots,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:53):**  and now they take it to the real world of farm fields,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:17:56):**  and the soil supplies much more in than the method recommended.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:02):**  It's exactly what you'd expect.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:05):**  This finding is obviously quite remarkable.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:08):**  What you're describing is that 33 out of 75 locations  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:11):**  are nonresponsive, 100% of the nitrogen  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:14):**  is being supplied from the soil, not from applied fertilizer.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:16):**  And in the remaining 40-some plots, approximately 66%  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:22):**  of the nitrogen in the crop at harvest  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:25):**  is still coming from soil, which means only 33%  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:27):**  is coming from applied fertilizer.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:29):**  Yes, and so let me make one more point about the 1.2 method.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:33):**  And that was it had an underlying assumption that  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:36):**  was not obvious, and we didn't realize it for many years,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:40):**  but finally dug it out.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:42):**  And the assumption behind the whole thing  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:44):**  was that 1 third of the nitrogen was  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:49):**  assumed to come from the soil and 2 thirds  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:52):**  from the fertilizer.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:55):**  It's upside down.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:18:57):**  Understanding that it's upside down,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:00):**  what is the real world scenario, and how  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:04):**  do we optimize what actually happens in the real world?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:07):**  If it's the case that 66% to 100% of the nitrogen  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:11):**  within a crop can come from organically derived nitrogen  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:16):**  that is in the soil, perhaps amino sugars,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:19):**  I personally would love to learn more about amino sugars.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:22):**  And then how can we optimize that?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:24):**  How can we develop more amino sugars in our soil profiles?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:28):**  OK, so as we gained an understanding  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:33):**  that the soil really is the major source of nitrogen  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:37):**  for crop uptake, it just stands to reason  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:41):**  that you should test the soil if that's the main source in order  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:47):**  to determine how much fertilizer you might need to apply.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:53):**  And that's where we went.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:55):**  So we developed the Illinois soil nitrogen  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:19:57):**  test that was an estimate of this so-called amino sugar  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:03):**  fraction.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:04):**  And then that was oriented toward variable rate nitrogen.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:13):**  Soils differ not only between farms,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:19):**  but even within the same field.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:22):**  There were entrepreneurs in the private sector  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:25):**  that began to use this kind of a test  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:27):**  and still do use it for variable rate and recommendations.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:32):**  So that the soil testing higher in this fraction  
**[0:20:36-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:36):**  gets a lower fertilizer rate and vice versa.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:44):**  That's where it went.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:45):**  And that's where it still needs to go.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:48):**  Where is this soil assay, the Illinois soil nitrogen test,

**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:55):**  at this point?  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:20:56):**  One of the labs that runs it is actually

**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:01):**  And we're doing on-farm research in conjunction with them  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:06):**  on several projects this year.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:07):**  But they routinely run this Illinois end  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:10):**  test to do variable rate end.

**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:16):**  Tim Smith is the lead agronomist there.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:20):**  CropSmith is the firm.

**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:25):**  So what exactly are amino sugars?  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:28):**  What proportion of the total nitrogen that

**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:42):**  are products of microbial activity.

**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:49):**  And they occur in various microbial constituents,  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:56):**  like microbial cell walls.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:21:59):**  They occur in spores.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:02):**  And they also occur in the material called chitin.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:06):**  We think of insect exoskeletons are made of chitin.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:12):**  Now, I'm not saying that the chitin is easily broken down.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:18):**  But I do believe that those other forms of amino sugars,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:23):**  namely bacterial cell walls, I think  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:27):**  those are quite a bit more decomposable.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:31):**  And there's another fraction that  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:33):**  contributes to this amino sugar in, which actually  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:38):**  isn't amino sugar.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:40):**  It occurs in the form of two essential amino acids.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:47):**  Those amino acids are asparagine and glutamine.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:51):**  And they contain two nitrogen atoms, not one,  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:55):**  not just in the amino group, but in an amide group  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:22:59):**  on the end of the chain.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:01):**  And that amide group is prone to break down.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:05):**  And it would be estimated by this Illinois soil end  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:09):**  test, as well as things like glucosamine or galactosamine

**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:23):**  The question of how much of the organic nitrogen in soils  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:27):**  occurs in this form, the textbooks

**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:35):**  is in the form of amino sugars.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:38):**  Considering that those estimates come from the classic methods  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:45):**  that we found were not accurate, I'm  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:48):**  inclined to think that the proportion is actually  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:51):**  higher than that.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:52):**  We've never done our own study to fractionate it and compare  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:57):**  the fractions.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:23:59):**  But I do wonder if that number has been on the low side.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:04):**  Probably reasonable to expect that the fraction  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:07):**  of total nitrogen that is represented  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:09):**  by these amino sugars will also vary  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:11):**  based on the degree of soil biological health and activity.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:16):**  And so this amino sugar fraction has  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:21):**  gained some traction as a parameter related  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:25):**  to what is a term I don't like all that much,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:28):**  but here it is, soil health.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:32):**  And I'm thinking of Salvita and Wilbrinton.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:37):**  And we've been in contact with them.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:38):**  We've done some work with them.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:40):**  He has a SLAN test that is another form of the Illinois

**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:50):**  And so I totally agree with your statement.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:53):**  Yes, the more biological activity you have in the soil,  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:56):**  you'd expect this fraction to be increased.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:24:59):**  I find your comment particularly intriguing

**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:46):**  And then some of those bacteria, the entire bacterial cells  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:50):**  are consumed.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:51):**  And a few of them survive the process  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:53):**  and are then transmitted back out through the root hairs  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:25:56):**  back into the soil environment along with root exudates

**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:05):**  a description of plant roots stripping off

**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:26:21):**  that I'm aware of in terms of its location

**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:11):**  I think that's a solid foundation  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:12):**  that many of our listeners have as a starting point.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:16):**  So let me perhaps refine the question a little bit to say,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:19):**  can we accelerate the development of amino sugars  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:24):**  with applied nitrogen?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:25):**  Does applied nitrogen remain in the soil profile  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:29):**  and contributes to an increase in the biologically available  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:32):**  nitrogen?  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:33):**  OK, when you say applied nitrogen,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:34):**  you're referring to synthetic fertilizer nitrogen?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:38):**  That's correct.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:39):**  OK.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, that opens the door to another topic.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:45):**  But before we go there, let me make the comment  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:49):**  that the increase in this so-called amino sugar nitrogen  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:55):**  fraction, I say so-called because it's  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:27:59):**  a mixture of different chemical forms,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:01):**  as I think I tried to explain.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:04):**  And a better term and one that's more chemically descriptive  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:09):**  would be alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:13):**  And that's how the Illinois Soil and Test estimates it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:17):**  But the issue is, how can that fraction  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:19):**  be increased in the soil?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:23):**  There I'd make a couple comments.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:25):**  And one is that in the early work,  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:30):**  as we came to realize the importance of that fraction  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:34):**  and its presence, we were finding that many times soils  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:40):**  that had been maneuvered had high levels of this so-called  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:46):**  amino sugar fraction.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:49):**  And so one point I would make is that maneuvering a soil  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:52):**  can enrich it in that fraction.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:55):**  And that seems to make a lot of sense,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:28:59):**  because manured soils supply more in  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:02):**  and have less need for synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:05):**  So that's one point.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:06):**  The second point is about the cover crops you mentioned.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:08):**  Now, we haven't done, my lab hasn't done any work  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:11):**  on cover crops.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:14):**  But just as a general discussion point,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:18):**  I would raise the issue that if you have a growing active plant  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:24):**  that's present, that plant is increasing microbial activities  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:30):**  and populations.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:32):**  And it stands to reason that as it does that,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:35):**  it's going to be increasing this so-called amino sugar  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:40):**  fraction, because that fraction is  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:42):**  connected with those microbes.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:45):**  And if you have more microbes and they're more active  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:48):**  in the rhizosphere, for example, you  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:51):**  should be enriching the soil in that fraction.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:54):**  So those two points I would raise about potential ways  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:29:57):**  to increase the soil's content of amino sugar in.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:05):**  Now, onto the other point.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:08):**  And this, too, was a major revelation for us,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:11):**  and certainly for me in particular.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:13):**  We have here at the University of Illinois  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:17):**  the oldest continuous research plots in North America.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:23):**  They're called the Morrill plots,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:24):**  and they date back to 18, as I recall now, I want to say 68.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:35):**  But it might be 1875 or so.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:39):**  A long time, in other words.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:41):**  Yeah, so we've been going at this for nearly 150 years now.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:45):**  It's getting there.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:47):**  Yeah, actually it was 1876.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:49):**  So those plots get cropped year after year after year.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:30:56):**  And these days, well, when I say these days,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:00):**  I'm referring to the years since 1967.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:05):**  There have been three rotations in those plots.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:09):**  Continuous corn, which dates back to 1876.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:15):**  Corn-soybean rotation, which dates to 1967,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:19):**  before then it was corn oats.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:23):**  And then corn oats hay, alfalfa hay.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:26):**  And that, too, goes back to 1876.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:31):**  So we have long-term experiments in place.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:34):**  And by the way, these are all, of course, static plots.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:38):**  We can't have a new Morrill plots every year.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:42):**  So it's the same ground, same treatments on the same plots.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:46):**  Now, the interesting thing is, again,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:48):**  my colleague Syed Khan comes into the picture.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:51):**  He had been a student here back in the 80s.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:31:55):**  And we worked together beginning in 1993.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:00):**  And he had noticed, well, the textbook message  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:07):**  addresses the point that you raised,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:11):**  that applying this synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:14):**  is going to help build soil organic matter  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:18):**  by supplying one of the key essential elements  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:23):**  in that organic matter, nitrogen.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:27):**  So it's kind of like a recipe for building organic matter.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:31):**  So Syed had noticed over the course of the years  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:38):**  that the continuous corn in the Morrill plots  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:42):**  just didn't look as healthy.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:48):**  And it wasn't giving the yields of corn oats hay  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:53):**  when that was growing corn.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:32:55):**  The plants were clearly different.

**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:01):**  and smaller and lighter green on continuous corn.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:05):**  Despite the fact that the continuous corn plots

**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:20):**  you would think that the continuous corn would

**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:30):**  It was getting three times the nitrogen.

**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:35):**  And it was much more biomass.

**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:48):**  and the Illinois soil end test on the Morrill plots.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:33:54):**  And lo and behold, both properties

**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:18):**  And it led to two papers and letters to the editor  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:24):**  and all kinds of exchanges.

**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:33):**  the change in organic matter for the different rotations  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:40):**  in the Morrill plots, and when we sampled  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:42):**  from each of those rotations the unfertilized subplot  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:48):**  and the fertilized subplot, well, my goodness,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:53):**  what do you suppose we found?  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:34:56):**  We compared archival samples that we had access to,

**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:12):**  And lo and behold, we found there

**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:17):**  on the fertilized subplots.

**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:26):**  there was a significant decrease.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:31):**  All that fertilizer did not build organic matter.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:36):**  In fact, it burned it.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:40):**  You mentioned a very key word, it burned it.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:43):**  And I think this is the aspect that many people miss  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:46):**  when they consider conventional fertilizer applications.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:50):**  They don't consider, A, the oxidizing effect  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:53):**  that it has directly on soil microbial communities,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:35:56):**  and B, the effect that it has on stimulating biology  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:02):**  to the point where you actually release carbon  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:04):**  dioxide from respiration.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:06):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:06):**  That second point is especially critical.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:10):**  And so let me explain it as best I can.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:15):**  With most living forms on planet Earth, carbon and nitrogen  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:22):**  are intrinsically coupled.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:25):**  It's true for us as well as microbes.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:27):**  So carbon and nitrogen have to come together.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:32):**  We have to have both.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:36):**  But you know, carbon is the principal commodity for life  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:42):**  because it generates both energy and carbon  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:48):**  for producing biomass.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:52):**  It's essential.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:54):**  So the microbes in soil have a keen interest  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:36:57):**  in organic carbon.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:00):**  It's how they make their living.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:03):**  And so when crop residues are returned to the soil,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:07):**  those microbes take an immediate interest.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:11):**  An opportunity presents itself.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:14):**  But they can only take advantage of it if they have nitrogen  
**[0:37:21-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:21):**  because carbon metabolism is, of course, an enzymatic process.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:30):**  And every enzyme contains nitrogen.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:36):**  So they can't use that carbon unless they have nitrogen.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:39):**  So we return the residues.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:42):**  And if we also give them nitrogen, they are in business.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:48):**  And once they are in business, what happens to the nitrogen?  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:52):**  And what happens to the carbon?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:54):**  So now they're going to be stimulated  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:37:57):**  to use more of that carbon.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:01):**  They're going to attack the residues first  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:05):**  because those are more decomposable.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:10):**  Their chemistry is such that they're more easily attacked.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:14):**  I talked earlier about the different forms of carbon,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:17):**  things like simple sugars, proteins, et cetera.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:21):**  So they can attack those more easily.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:24):**  And they will.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:24):**  They take the easy stuff first.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:28):**  And if you stimulate them by applying fertilizer in,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:33):**  they do it that much better.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:36):**  But if they still have available nitrogen  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:40):**  after they've exhausted the residues,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:43):**  well, they're just going to look for other sources of carbon.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:47):**  And lo and behold, there's the organic matter.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:52):**  And that's why they attack it.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:38:55):**  If you give microbes nitrogen, they want carbon.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:00):**  If you give them carbon, they want nitrogen.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:04):**  They always require those two in the balance.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:06):**  Yep, exactly.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:08):**  So their C to N ratio is on the order of 7 or 8 to 1,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:13):**  7 carbon to 1 nitrogen. And so they're  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:17):**  in the business of making other things look like themselves.

**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:24):**  They burn off the excess carbon.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:28):**  So this means, in essence, yeah, that's exactly it.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:31):**  This means, in essence, that when  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:32):**  you supply more nitrogen than is required for residue digestion  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:37):**  or any time the soil has pre-leveled the nitrogen,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:41):**  applied synthetic fertilizer nitrogen,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:43):**  then that is going to result in the off-gassing of carbon  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:47):**  dioxide.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:48):**  So in fact, adding nitrogen means  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:50):**  you deplete organic matter, not build it.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:53):**  In fact, that's exactly what we came to realize.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:39:57):**  And along the way, we became aware of papers  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:01):**  published long before we got into that topic.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:06):**  I'm thinking of one published by a guy named William Albrecht.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:13):**  It's very interesting.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:15):**  It was a paper I never heard of in any class I ever took.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:19):**  Back in 1938, he published that paper.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:23):**  It came from Sanborn Field at Columbia, Missouri.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:28):**  Now, this gets interesting, and I always  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:31):**  share this story with my class.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:33):**  So Albrecht, he actually is an alumnus  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:36):**  of the University of Illinois.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:38):**  He got four degrees here.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:43):**  And then he went to Missouri, and that's  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:45):**  where he spent his career.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:49):**  Well, in 1938, William Albrecht published  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:55):**  two papers on this subject.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:40:57):**  The first came out in a handbook from the USDA  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:02):**  called Soils and Men.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:05):**  And in that chapter, he gives this conventional textbook  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:10):**  message that in order to build organic matter,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:13):**  you must have adequate nitrogen.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:17):**  Then later that year, he published a different message.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:26):**  And it was in an article that was  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:28):**  published in the South Science Society of America Proceedings.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:32):**  And it came from data he had collected from Sanborn Field.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:38):**  And it was under, I believe, continuous wheat.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:41):**  Now, Sanborn Field was started later than the Morrill Plots.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:47):**  Morrill Plots in 1876.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:49):**  Sanborn Field was started in 1888.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:41:56):**  But the guys who set up Sanborn Field  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:00):**  were more forward thinking than the Morrill Plots guys.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:06):**  And from the first year, they included a treatment  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:10):**  with synthetic nitrogen. Back then, it was ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:15):**  So the years began to add up.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:17):**  And in 1914, they had completed their first 25 years.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:24):**  And I don't think Albrecht was there at that time,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:27):**  but the plots had been sampled and the samples had been kept.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:32):**  Albrecht was there after the next 25 years in 1938.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:39):**  He did the sampling and he compared the organic matter,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:44):**  or actually organic carbon, in the fertilized and the unfertilized treatments,  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:52):**  comparing the 50th year and the 25th year.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:56):**  And what do you suppose he found?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:42:59):**  That the unfertilized plots had actually gained organic matter  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:05):**  and the fertilized had lost.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:08):**  And from that point on, he never again said  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:14):**  that you must have adequate nitrogen to build soil organic matter.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:18):**  To his credit, he never again said that.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:21):**  Now he was saying that fertilizer nitrogen burns the soil.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:28):**  That's what he said.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:30):**  And our work with the Morrill Plots is entirely consistent with his statement.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:36):**  Richard, this conversation around nitrogen has been illuminating and valuable.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:42):**  I want to be considerate of our audience and your time.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:46):**  And I want to change gears a little bit to a related group of research  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:52):**  that you published as well.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:54):**  You published several interesting papers titled The Potassium Paradox.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:43:58):**  You made some waves with that.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:00):**  I enjoy having conversations with people who make waves.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:03):**  So I'd love to get into that a little bit,  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:06):**  tell us the story of how the Potassium Paradox came to be.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:09):**  Well, here again, my colleague Saeed Khan comes to the forefront.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:13):**  In fact, Saeed was and still is the expert on that topic.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:20):**  I've learned an immense amount from him working on it.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:24):**  And what I now know, I pass on to my students,  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:29):**  and it's a very different message from the one that you'll find in the textbooks.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:33):**  Saeed had started working on potassium when he was an agronomist back in Pakistan.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:40):**  And he has stories that are very interesting from that time.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:45):**  I won't go into those here.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:47):**  But he came to Illinois in the 80s to do first a master's and then a Ph.D. degree.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:53):**  And for both degrees, he worked on potassium.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:44:58):**  And I happened to be on his graduate committee for the Ph.D.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:04):**  It's embarrassing to think how ignorant I was of potassium back in those days.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:13):**  Really quite ashamed of it.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:16):**  But there were many stones left unturned.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:19):**  Saeed had been involved in a project in which he did soil testing for potassium  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:27):**  every two weeks at what we call the South Farm here just off campus.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:33):**  So he was sampling the same plots throughout the year every two weeks.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:39):**  That was the gist of his thesis.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:42):**  The data were all over the place.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:45):**  It was amazing how this test varied.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:50):**  That makes for a challenging thesis.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:52):**  Indeed it did.

**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:45:58):**  And of course, I didn't have a clue.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:00):**  But one of the trends that he documented in that thesis work was that the unfertilized plots,  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:08):**  over the course of those four years he did this,  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:11):**  they were increasing in their average potassium levels.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:17):**  They were increasing.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:19):**  He was testing the surface plow layer down to about seven inches.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:24):**  And he was seeing an increase in those unfertilized plots.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:28):**  Now, why would this be?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:32):**  And he came to realize, well, it's the soil.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:36):**  And he had many more data coming from various lab tests that were in his thesis.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:42):**  And they all tell a story in which they're saying the soil is releasing potassium.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:49):**  Oh, my.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:52):**  You know, there's a lot of potassium in soils.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:46:55):**  About 40,000 pounds per acre in the top six inches of many midwestern soils.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:00):**  In the top six inches.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:01):**  And if you go down through the profile, or at least through the rooting depth,  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:05):**  you're talking about half a million pounds, typically in a prairie soil like we have in much of Illinois.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:12):**  It's a humongous amount.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:15):**  Well, it does seem like the crop would take note that it's in a sea of potassium.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:23):**  And so, as we got into that potassium paradox project,  
**[0:47:28-0:47:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:28):**  mainly what we spent our time doing was collecting and reviewing a lot of potassium studies.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:38):**  I mean, a lot.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:39):**  We had 500 references in that paper.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:42):**  Well, over and over again, many of those studies, and especially in places like Illinois,  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:52):**  would show no significant yield increase from cave fertilization.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:47:59):**  That would be common trend.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:01):**  Especially for grain production, but even for forage production.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:07):**  That would often be the case.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:09):**  Wow.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:12):**  So, naturally, you begin to wonder, why are farmers using all this potash fertilizer?  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:20):**  And believe me, when Said gave a talk at the National No-Till Conference back several years ago,  
**[0:48:27-0:48:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:27):**  there was a lot of interest in his message, both from the farmers and the fertilizer industry.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:38):**  I anticipate there were different emotional reactions from different audiences.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:42):**  There were indeed.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:44):**  And so, in that paper, we've been a great deal of effort documenting that there was often no response in terms of yield to potash.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:48:55):**  And we also went into great detail about changes in the soil test.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:01):**  And we did a lot of balanced documenting in different places throughout the world.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:06):**  And over and over again, you'd see that there was an increase in exchangeable K without fertilization.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:15):**  That's common because the K is coming out from the clay.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:20):**  That's where it is.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:22):**  And so it builds up.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:24):**  And then we came to realize another really important part of this.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:29):**  And I didn't know anything about this until we did that project.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:33):**  The crop grows and it extracts K by its roots.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:38):**  Well, what's going on there?  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:41):**  Potassium is in the clay.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:44):**  That's the key fraction.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:46):**  And there's more clay in the subsoil than there is in the plow layer.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:49:53):**  So as the plant builds its root system and begins to exploit the subsoil, my gosh, it has a lot of access to potassium.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:02):**  And it takes it up.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:06):**  And as it takes it up, it's going to transport it.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:10):**  A lot of it ends up in the above-ground plant material.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:14):**  Now, what happens there?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:17):**  Another important point that I learned from Said.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:21):**  The potassium is always in inorganic forms.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:27):**  It's never organic.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:29):**  So in the plant, like in the soil, it stays inorganic.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:34):**  It's just salts.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:36):**  That's all it is.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:38):**  And a lot of the K in plant material ends up as carbonate.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:43):**  Potassium carbonate.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:45):**  Now, what happens here?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:47):**  The plant grows that above-ground biomass.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:51):**  At the end of the growing season, the harvest is going typically to leave that biomass with a grain crop.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:50:58):**  It's left on the surface.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:01):**  The rainfall leaches the salts out of the residue.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:07):**  And here again, an important point.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:10):**  Potassium is the major plant cation.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:14):**  There's a lot of K salts in the residue.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:17):**  In fact, for a crop like corn, the residue has three times the potassium content of the grain.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:25):**  Most of the K is going to be recycled.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:29):**  And just last week, I learned another interesting lesson about this.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:35):**  Potassium carbonate.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:37):**  We had some plots that had to be fertilized with potassium.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:41):**  Not because they needed it, but because we had to satisfy the reviewers.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:45):**  And we didn't want to use a source that would have salt burn, like muriata potash, KCL.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:53):**  High salt index.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:55):**  We didn't want this.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:51:56):**  So my graduate student and I came up with the idea that why don't we use potassium carbonate?  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:02):**  Can't possibly hurt the plant.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:04):**  Because it's in the plant.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:06):**  What we discovered when we did some checking on properties and then made a solution,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:12):**  this potassium carbonate is tremendously soluble.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:17):**  So that brought reality to my thinking that on a point that Said had often told me,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:25):**  potassium just leaches out of the plant.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:29):**  When it rains, potassium leaches out of the plant, drips from the leaves.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:33):**  You can't stop this stuff.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:37):**  And so it comes back to the soil, but it's on the surface now.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:43):**  Now just think of this.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:45):**  When soil testers go out to test for potash, like for pH, they typically just sample the plow layer.

**[0:52:57-0:53:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:52:57):**  And yet the plow layer is being enriched by the plant in potassium.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:05):**  It's coming out of biomass.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:07):**  And especially out of the residues.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:10):**  So this comes back to the point I told you that the unfertilized soils showed an increase in K test values over time.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:20):**  Because the K was coming from the residues.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:26):**  That's why they increased.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:29):**  We've actually observed with in-field experience, particularly on no-till operations,  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:35):**  and particularly on those no-till soils where a lot of glyphosate is still used,  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:40):**  where greater than 90% of the total potassium that is measured in the top six or seven inches in the A horizon,  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:46):**  actually exists in the top one-half inch to one inch of the soil profile.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:51):**  So what you're describing is that the majority, and of course that potassium in that layer,  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:53:57):**  as soon as that layer dries out and is exposed to sunlight or is limited in moisture in the summer,  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:02):**  the potassium in that layer disappears in terms of plant availability.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:05):**  Plants can't access it anymore.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:07):**  Yes.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:08):**  And so now you're saying the other significant source of potassium is actually in the clay layer,  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:15):**  in the B horizon of the soil profile.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:17):**  Yes, that's the storehouse.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:18):**  And so on that fraction, let me make the point too.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:22):**  Here we are with a cation in the form of potassium.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:25):**  It only has one positive charge, and it's competing for exchange sites with divalent calcium and magnesium.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:34):**  They stick tighter because they have more charge.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:38):**  And yet the irony is that potassium leaching losses are very low, very much lower than calcium.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:51):**  Now why would that be, and this is another question I put to my class, now why would that be?  
**[0:54:58-0:55:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:54:58):**  Why would it be that calcium would be so readily lost by leaching and potassium, hardly any?  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:06):**  It's because of the clay.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:09):**  The potassium gets fixed in the clay, and calcium does not.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:14):**  Potassium is the right size to go between the clay layers, and calcium is too big.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:20):**  That's the reason.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:22):**  So we've talked about potassium, the potassium paradox.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:26):**  You mentioned an important point that I can't avoid elaborating on a little bit.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:31):**  So potassium is stored within the clay, within the clay platelets, but now we have to open another can of worms.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:38):**  What happens when you have clay aging because of exposure to very strong oxidizing materials like, say, anhydrous ammonia?  
**[0:55:47-0:55:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:47):**  Okay, so one of the biggest factors on the status of the clay and its storage of clay is wetting and drying.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:55:56):**  So when the clays dry, they expand.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:00):**  They open up, and the clay comes out from between the layers.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:06):**  When they get wet, they swell, and they close up.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:11):**  It traps the clay.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:13):**  So wetting and drying is one of the most important factors, and that's been known for a very long time.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:19):**  But, you know, the thing is that I didn't realize, I don't think Said did in his early studies, is how dynamic that clay fixed K is.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:29):**  The textbook tells us, oh, that's pretty inert.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:34):**  It's not available to plants.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:36):**  Hogwash.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:38):**  That fixed K fraction is resupplying the exchangeable K.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:44):**  It's a very dynamic and rapid process.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:48):**  It's tied to moisture.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:50):**  And in fact, it even impacts the clay-bearing minerals.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:55):**  That's a huge reservoir in soils.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:56:58):**  And we came across a study in Germany, a very interesting study by a guy named Mengele.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:05):**  And he had done a greenhouse study in which he had removed the fine fraction, the clay fraction, from the potting mixture.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:19):**  And he was growing plants on just sand and coarse silt.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:24):**  And he measured the K uptake, and it was substantial.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:31):**  So we get the idea that, oh, this K in those minerals between the clay layers, it just can't come out.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:37):**  It does.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:39):**  And part of it is because the plant itself knows how to get it.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:44):**  So plant roots produce acidity, partly through respiration, making carbonic acid.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:50):**  And the acids attack the minerals, and they dissolve the K out of there.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:57:57):**  The plant takes up the minerals, the mineral K.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:01):**  So those fractions are not inert.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:04):**  They are actively feeding the plant.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:08):**  And so the K testers come along, they measure a fraction called exchangeable.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:13):**  And they say, oh, this is what's available for the crop to use, and there's not much of it, so we need to fertilize.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:20):**  And the truth is, it's the tip of the iceberg because the exchangeable fraction will be resupplied by non-exchangeable and mineral K.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:32):**  There's a huge reservoir.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:35):**  You're just seeing a snapshot of one tiny fraction means nothing because it's going to be resupplied.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:43):**  And that's a central point about K cycling.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:47):**  There's so much in the soil.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:49):**  One more point I should add here.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:51):**  In the course of all this K paradox discussion and work that we did,  
**[0:58:57-0:59:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:58:57):**  we came across a publication from this university back about 100 years ago, actually more than 100 years ago now.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:08):**  And it was by a guy named Cyril Hopkins, who was a very famous soil scientist in the beginning of the 20th century.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:18):**  And what was his message about potassium?  
**[0:59:22-0:59:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:22):**  Published a bulletin on it.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:25):**  He told farmers, you don't need it.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:29):**  The soil is a K mine.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:33):**  And he got into a fight with the fertilizer industry.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:38):**  Boy, history has a way of repeating itself.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:42):**  Isn't it true?  
**[0:59:44-0:59:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:44):**  Particularly in regards to picking a fight with the fertilizer industry.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:51):**  I do think it's important, though, I don't want to lose sight of the question that I asked about clay aging.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=0:59:57):**  My understanding of clay aging is that there are some materials which are particularly effective at aging a clay.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:03):**  Potassium chloride and anhydrous ammonia are pretty close to the top of the list in my understanding.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:09):**  And what that means when they age a clay is that clay loses its swelling capacity and no longer expands and contracts.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:17):**  So it no longer releases potassium. Is that correct?  
**[1:00:21-1:00:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:21):**  Okay, now let's go into that a little bit more.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:23):**  So this business of shrinking and swelling is real important for the release of K from soil.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:30):**  So in fact, what happens when you apply potash is that the potash is sucked into the clay.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:41):**  In most soils, it's going to be pulled in. It's going to be fixed.

**[1:00:51-1:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:51):**  It collapses the clay layers.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:54):**  That's what it's going to do. It's going to lock them together.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:00:58):**  And so by applying K, you actually reduce the capacity of the soil to supply K.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:06):**  And not only that, you reduce the soil's cation exchange capacity because a lot of that is between the clay layers.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:16):**  And applying K collapses the layers.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:20):**  Seems like an excellent recipe for selling crop protection products.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:27):**  We'll just first damage the soil and then we will supply the solutions to treat the unhealthy crops that now grow on these damaged soils.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:35):**  Let me give you just a brief story that we heard from the guys at Growers Mineral Solutions.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:41):**  They talked about a field in Ohio where it tested low for K and the order went out to the local fertilizer dealer that they needed to apply K.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:01:56):**  And so the truck went out, the K was applied, and they made the mistake of retesting the field.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:06):**  And what do you think they found? The K test was lower than it had been.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:12):**  And so the manager at the fertilizer plant got on the driver and said,  
**[1:02:19-1:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:19):**  Why, you dummy, you went to the wrong field. Go out and do it again. Well, he didn't go to the wrong field.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:28):**  He went back to the same field and put more K on, and they retested it again, and the K went down more.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:36):**  Wow, that's impressive.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:39):**  That's what it can do.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:43):**  So, Richard, in conclusion, in summary, what would your advice be to growers for nitrogen and potassium management?  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:51):**  How would you approach it?  
**[1:02:52-1:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:52):**  For nitrogen, again, it goes back to the point that the soil is the main source.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:02:59):**  So if at all possible, I would encourage farmers to use something like the Illinois N test.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:08):**  I'm not talking about nitrate testing now. Nitrate comes, nitrate goes, it's dynamic.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:13):**  This Illinois N test fraction is much more stable, and you can map a field and then do variable rate N.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:21):**  In my view, that is a very good approach for managing N.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:27):**  More work is needed to better calibrate the test, but it certainly can help give a grower an idea about what his soil can supply.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:37):**  In regards to potassium, what Said and I recommended in that paper was because soil K testing just doesn't work.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:48):**  The best approach, if there's a concern that there might be a need for K fertilization, do strip trials.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:03:59):**  So drop off to no K, compare it with some low K rates, and don't go high in the K rate because it'll never give that kind of response.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:09):**  It'll just be a low amount if any is needed.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:12):**  And we also recommended that if possible, it would be better not to use myriated potash, but instead the sulfate.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:22):**  And that gets into the issue about chloride versus sulfate, or sulfate's nutrient, chloride is not,  
**[1:04:31-1:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:31):**  and chloride competes with nitrate for plant uptake, not good in terms of N fertility.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:38):**  So those were our recommendations for N and K.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:41):**  Thank you. What resources would you recommend to growers if they wanted to learn more about these conversations?  
**[1:04:47-1:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:47):**  There's obviously the papers that you have co-authored with Said and others, which we will link in the show notes for all of our listeners.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:55):**  Are there any other recommendations for those who want to learn more that you would recommend?  
**[1:04:59-1:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:04:59):**  Well, offhand as I sit here, I'm just thinking maybe one possibility would be to contact a company like CropSmith.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:07):**  I'm not saying they're the only one, but they know the value of optimizing the soil as the source of nutrients.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:16):**  And that fertilizer rates could be much lower than many growers use.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:21):**  So CropSmith would be one source. Another guy that is aware of this message and writes about it would be Ken Ferry from the Farm Journal.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:30):**  Ken loses the Illinois N test for variable rate N, and he's aware that the soil is the main source.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/episodes/the-fallacy-of-mainstream-potassium-and-nitrogen-fertilization-with-richard-mulvaney/#t=1:05:40):**  Wonderful. Richard, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and your knowledge.

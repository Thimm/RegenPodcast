**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:11):**  to diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:16):**  a legitimate conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:21):**  people with incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:27):**  regenerative agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:07):**  On this podcast, we explore the science and practical application of regenerative  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:11):**  agriculture ecosystems, and talk about how to regenerate soil and crop health and quality  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:17):**  and how to increase farm profitability. In this episode, I had a very enjoyable discussion with  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:23):**  Dr. Chris Nichols, where we spoke about the value of developing soil fungal populations,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:31):**  developing climate resilient crops. And one piece that I found particularly intriguing was the  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:37):**  negative impact of synthetic fertilizer applications, particularly phosphorus and  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:44):**  nitrogen applications on soil biology, particularly on soil fungi, and the implications that has for  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:50):**  developing truly regenerative agriculture ecosystems. Chris, you've done a lot of work  
**[0:02:56-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:02:56):**  looking at soil biology and the impact of soil biology on plant performance and growing really  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:04):**  climate resilient crops. What are some of the highlights of the pieces that you have worked on  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:10):**  over the years that are very memorable for you? Well, some of the most memorable highlights kind  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:17):**  of starting a little bit maybe chronologically was when I started at the University of Minnesota  
**[0:03:24-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:24):**  as an undergrad and was able to do some research working in a laboratory where I  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:33):**  discovered arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These are organisms that have relationships with  
**[0:03:40-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:40):**  over 90% of the plants and most of crop plants are associated with mycorrhizal fungi and these  
**[0:03:49-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:49):**  fungi help the plants to get nutrients and water from the soil in exchange for photosynthetically  
**[0:03:58-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:03:58):**  derived carbon. This is a very old, very important relationship that plants and fungi have had  
**[0:04:08-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:08):**  and it was fascinating to me to see how interconnected these two organisms could be  
**[0:04:17-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:17):**  and how much life depended on having these organisms work together. So that led me to  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:26):**  want to continue to study these fungi and plant relationships into my graduate work. I grew up on  
**[0:04:35-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:35):**  a farm and was involved in agriculture in various ways and farming. This was in the 80s, not totally  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:45):**  to date myself, but in the 80s and during that time farming and agriculture was very difficult  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:52):**  and I think like many young people I didn't want to do what my parents were doing and  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:04:58):**  wanted to run away from the farm and although I was fascinated by these fungi I didn't want to get  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:03):**  into farming but life becomes very funny and I ended up falling back into agriculture and when  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:11):**  I was able to get a position working for USDA, Agriculture Research Service in North Dakota,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:20):**  and being able to work with the farmers like Gabe Brown in North Dakota who were doing  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:29):**  really fascinating innovative things that were taking some of the science that I had been  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:37):**  learning about and researching in the laboratory and actually applying this in the real world.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:43):**  I was seeing that the things that I had been discovering and thinking about in the laboratory  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:50):**  actually had connections in the real world and the things that I was questioning and couldn't  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:05:59):**  fully understand how things were working, those questions I could start to see play out  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:07):**  in what these farmers were taking a look at. When I interviewed Gabe he made a comment and I'm  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:15):**  quoting from memory so it might not be perfect but in essence he said that today he is not  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:21):**  losing any synthetic fertilizers on his farm and that is due to a comment that you made when you  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:28):**  visited his farm at one moment where you said that as long as he continues to use synthetic  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:34):**  fertilizers he can never expect to regenerate soil and plants to their full potential.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:40):**  I'm really fascinated by that comment. Could you describe for us a little bit of why you  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:45):**  believe that to be true? Well that really goes back with the research that I was doing in the  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:51):**  laboratory where we would see this very strong connection with the mycorrhizal fungi and the  
**[0:06:58-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:06:58):**  organisms that were in the soil and the potential that these organisms have for being able to  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:07):**  resolve the nutrient issues that plants have. What we could find was that in the laboratory we could  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:17):**  see that they could resolve those issues but when we were trying to see if farmers were willing to  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:26):**  apply those in the field the system was still very much dependent upon utilizing a lot of synthetic  
**[0:07:34-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:34):**  fertilizers and I couldn't fully understand why we thought that we needed to still be dependent  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:43):**  upon these synthetic fertilizers when what I was seeing in the laboratory was that we didn't really  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:50):**  need to do that. When I looked at Gabe's system and the way that he was applying things and the  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:07:57):**  way that he was stimulating the biological activity I started to think that really he was  
**[0:08:03-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:03):**  putting in the tools in place that were important for biological activity, reducing the amount of  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:13):**  tillage that he was doing. In fact he had gone to a no-till system so a little bit of a  
**[0:08:18-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:18):**  no-till system so eliminating soil disturbance, improving the crop rotation, utilizing cover crops,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:27):**  making sure that he had plants growing as much as possible. So he was putting the tools into place  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:34):**  that was stimulating the biological activity but he still wasn't optimizing fully the efficiencies  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:42):**  of the organisms that are in the soil especially the mycorrhizal fungi and that was really because  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:48):**  he was outsourcing the job of the mycorrhizal fungi the fact that they will provide the  
**[0:08:55-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:08:55):**  nutrients to the plants if the plants are required to give that photosynthetically derived carbon  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:05):**  to the mycorrhizal fungi and the consortium organisms that work with the mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:12):**  to get those nutrients and if you don't start that early enough in the process  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:18):**  you're not going to be able to optimize that functionality and so that was the missing link  
**[0:09:24-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:24):**  for Gabe that he needed to really optimize that functionality in order to be able to maximize  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:33):**  those efficiencies. One of the pieces that we have observed working with many vegetable farmers is  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:40):**  they it's been standard practice and as I'm sure it is as well on many broadacre crops to apply  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:47):**  a soluble phosphorus fertilizer at planting and with the vegetable crops we know that when we  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:09:54):**  apply soluble phosphorus fertilizers we don't see the mycorrhizal colonization happening.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:10:00):**  So I think what you're describing if I'm understanding it correctly is that when you  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:10:05):**  apply the soluble phosphorus fertilizers then you essentially remove the need for the plant to have  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:10:11):**  a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizae because they can already obtain a generous supply of  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:10:16):**  phosphorus. Exactly again it becomes very critically important to work a lot with the timing.

**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:24:59):**  you made earlier regarding water and water use efficiency it's my understanding that

**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:16):**  access water in the soil profile and make it available that plants might not be able to access and they also  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:24):**  contribute perhaps drop resilience in other ways can you describe that for us a little bit  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:29):**  yeah you're exactly right there are two different processes that are going on  
**[0:25:34-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:34):**  one is the diameter of the fungal hyphae because they are much smaller in diameter than  
**[0:25:44-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:44):**  the roots are they can actually colonize into new zones in the soil environment and access water  
**[0:25:56-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:25:56):**  that normally plant roots can't access so researchers in more arid environments have  
**[0:26:04-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:04):**  been able to see this and you know we can see this in the natural world fungi are part of allowing  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:13):**  plants to grow on rocks they break down rock material they penetrate through that very dense  
**[0:26:22-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:22):**  environment and access water in very solid rocky types of environments this is a way you know you  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:33):**  see lichens growing on rocks and allowing trees to be able to grow basically on the sides of  
**[0:26:39-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:39):**  mountains and and those types of things that happens because fungi are allowing for the roots  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:47):**  to be able to grow through there and access and break through that material and it's that diameter  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:26:54):**  of the fungal hyphae penetrating through that dense material so that's one way in which that  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:01):**  happens the other way is the overall water use efficiency this is a way you know you see life  
**[0:27:08-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:08):**  growing on rocks and allowing we don't fully understand about soil and soil biology and about  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:16):**  plants and how plants grow and one of the most basic things with how plants grow is the fact  
**[0:27:24-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:24):**  that we have no idea how much water a plant actually needs we water plants all the time we  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:33):**  think plants need water we think we know how much we need to be watering plants we've done irrigation  
**[0:27:39-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:39):**  studies but so much of that is more dependent upon the soil in which we're growing the plants  
**[0:27:50-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:27:50):**  than how much water the plant actually needs because there is water needs on a cellular level  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:00):**  how much water is in the cytoplasm of the plants in the xylem and the flow of the plants utilized  
**[0:28:07-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:07):**  to move the minerals through the plants but how much water is then actually needed in the media  
**[0:28:18-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:18):**  in the rhizosphere surrounding the plants in order for nutrients to get from that media  
**[0:28:28-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:28):**  from that media into the plant roots themselves and this is where it's critically important  
**[0:28:38-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:38):**  to understand and recognize if you can get the relationship of the mycorrhizal fungi occurring  
**[0:28:48-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:28:48):**  early enough in the plant growth that is going to allow you to create this network of fungal hyphae  
**[0:29:00-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:00):**  that can be essentially hundreds of miles long but it may only be a few feet around the plant  
**[0:29:11-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:11):**  roots themselves what that does is that fills that environment so that wherever there may be  
**[0:29:21-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:21):**  an atom of nitrogen or a molecule of nitrate or an amino acid or a potassium ion or a copper ion  
**[0:29:35-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:35):**  or whatever it is that the plant needs there is going to be a piece of hyphae that will be nearby  
**[0:29:45-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:45):**  and what that does is it makes sure that there is a very short distance that that ion has to move  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:29:57):**  in water to reach the hyphae so that it can be then absorbed and once it gets into the hyphae  
**[0:30:05-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:05):**  it's all moving through water that is part of the water that's in within the cells of the fungi  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:15):**  and then once it reaches the plant roots it's all then within the cells of the plant  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:22):**  so you're efficiently now using water you only used a small amount of water  
**[0:30:28-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:28):**  in the soil environment and so the more that you can have this type of architecture designed  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:38):**  the more efficiently you're utilizing water in that environment if you were to imagine  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:46):**  that you fulfilled the nutrient requirements for the plant early on in the growing season  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:30:53):**  and the plant basically didn't require the presence of the mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:01):**  so you didn't get the growth of this hyphal network and then later in the growing season  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:08):**  it started to get this hyphal network but the hyphal network now isn't very extensive because  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:15):**  it hasn't been growing for very long and now the plant has a nutrient demand  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:21):**  the soil is very dry now you need to utilize more water in order to be able to try  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:30):**  and get those nutrients flowing now you're dependent on water that is in the bulk soil  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:37):**  environment that the plant roots can access not on that which the mycorrhizal can access and i think  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:43):**  you mentioned another very key piece which is that when the mycorrhizal network establishes at the  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:49):**  beginning early in the plant's life you end up with a mycorrhizal network that substantially  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:31:55):**  exceeds the root system size so you're extending out past the root system in some cases quite a  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:01):**  distance and they can access water that the plant roots themselves wouldn't be able to reach as well  
**[0:32:06-0:32:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:06):**  exactly so you're gaining layers of efficiency and this is what has been you know so critical  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:15):**  about this relationship and why these relationships have lasted for as long as they have  
**[0:32:22-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:22):**  is because they have fulfilled these roles and continued to make themselves more and more  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:31):**  efficient so some of the things they've done to improve the efficiency is one of the unique  
**[0:32:38-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:38):**  relationships that has been established between mycorrhizal fungi and another organism  
**[0:32:47-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:47):**  phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and these bacteria they will colonize the hyphae of mycorrhizal  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:32:56):**  fungi they essentially grow on the hyphae of the mycorrhizal fungi which is good for them  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:03):**  bacteria are smaller even than the the fungal hyphae themselves which means that it's very  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:11):**  hard for you to move to a new environment if you can hitch a ride on a fungus it's nice  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:17):**  so they hitch a ride on fungi so that they can get to different environments and what they do  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:24):**  is they will basically produce enzymes that release phosphate and they will get into the  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:31):**  environment and they release phosphate from minerals phosphate likes to be bound in soil  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:39):**  to either iron or aluminum or to calcium they produce an enzyme that releases that phosphate  
**[0:33:46-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:33:46):**  now the phosphate will be solubilized it will stay soluble for a brief period of time it again

**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:09):**  and energy sources all the various projects and research that you've done what has been something  
**[0:39:14-0:39:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:14):**  that really surprised you the thing that really surprised me was sort of a little bit indirectly  
**[0:39:24-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:24):**  i knew it but it didn't hit me as strongly until a few years back and it was actually something  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:33):**  that that happened on a personal level i ended up and i apologize i'm going to go off on a little  
**[0:39:40-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:40):**  bit of a tangent i i ended up having a thyroid cancer and your thyroid controls your metabolism  
**[0:39:50-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:50):**  your body's ability to process carbon and i had to get my thyroid removed and then they needed to  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:39:59):**  wait for a while and not allow my body to have the synthetic hormone that normally they'll give you  
**[0:40:07-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:07):**  so that your body knows how to metabolize carbon they wanted to essentially try and get if there  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:15):**  were any remaining cancer cells in my body after they removed my thyroid they wanted those cancer  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:21):**  cells to replicate so when they did the radiation treatment they could kill them all and they  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:28):**  could kill them and what happened was my body started not being able to function very well i  
**[0:40:36-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:36):**  couldn't think very well and it made me think about how the whole entire agro ecosystem functions  
**[0:40:46-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:46):**  again going back to this whole thing with carbon and carbon flow through all of these organisms  
**[0:40:56-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:40:56):**  and so this whole pay-as-you-go type of a system this carbon exchange was so essential because  
**[0:41:05-0:41:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:05):**  without carbon nothing works and if you can't get carbon flowing from one organism to another  
**[0:41:16-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:16):**  organism it doesn't function and so again kind of going back to the work that i had been doing with  
**[0:41:24-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:24):**  my body i would say what was missing he was doing the no-till he was doing the crop rotation  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:32):**  he was doing the cover crops and those types of things but he was missing the fact that he was  
**[0:41:40-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:40):**  cutting off the payment of carbon to the soil organism and so everything from then on for me  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:50):**  was just a matter of time. So what discussions i would have with farmers on what is it that you're  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:41:57):**  missing that's stopping the payment flowing to the right organisms in the system are you not growing  
**[0:42:06-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:06):**  cover crops is your rotation not complex enough are you doing tillage so that the the system has  
**[0:42:15-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:15):**  a building process as opposed to an enhancement process how is the carbon flowing and being  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:23):**  metabolized what do you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other people don't  
**[0:42:31-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:31):**  believe to be true or that is perhaps not mainstream i believe that we have the capacity  
**[0:42:40-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:40):**  to feed at least 14 billion people which is way beyond where our current population nutrient-dense  
**[0:42:51-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:42:51):**  food and at the same time to have a high quality of life and to maintain and enhance our ecosystem  
**[0:43:05-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:05):**  services yeah i absolutely agree and i would say in fact we already produce enough food to  
**[0:43:14-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:14):**  probably feed 12 to 14 billion people but that we have a distribution problem not a production  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:21):**  problem but there is in continuing with with the the essence of what you described there is  
**[0:43:29-0:43:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:29):**  so much untapped potential every crop that we are growing has untapped genetic potential that  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:37):**  there is there still exists with the genetics that we already have today on many crops for  
**[0:43:44-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:44):**  us to increase yields anywhere from 30 to upwards of 100 i believe on those crops so  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:53):**  i completely agree that we have we have the capacity to do so much more we already have  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:43:57):**  the knowledge we have the information there is still there's still a lot that we don't know  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:02):**  there's still a lot that we need to learn but we already know enough to make a really substantial  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:07):**  difference i i totally agree with you you know as far as how much we produce i think the biggest  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:14):**  thing that we're missing now is the nutritive quality of what we're producing because we're  
**[0:44:21-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:21):**  losing that connection of the nutritional value many of our important amino acids  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:31):**  antioxidants what we've always referred to as sort of polyphenolics and phytonutrients  
**[0:44:39-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:39):**  are actually more tied to the soil biology and soil microbiology and that's what we need to be  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:48):**  tapping back into i'd love to unwrap that just a little bit more because this is something that  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:44:53):**  we've observed and that i realized as well and i haven't seen it being explored very well in the  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:00):**  literature we have observed that when we have really aggressive biology in the in the rhizosphere  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:07):**  profile that there is a much greater production of all these what are generally referred to as  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:13):**  plant secondary metabolites all the terpenoids the phytoalexins and all these biophylatoids  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:19):**  etc all the aromatic compounds that plants produce and so forth so based on the work that you have  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:26):**  done what is the impact of biology on producing higher levels of these compounds and plants  
**[0:45:33-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:33):**  well there are two things that are going on one is there are many compounds that are actually coming  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:41):**  directly from soil microbes especially many fungi that produce many of these compounds  
**[0:45:49-0:45:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:49):**  and then those compounds are finding their way into the food chain through plants so the plants  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:45:57):**  are taking in many of these compounds that are actually originally produced by microorganisms  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:05):**  that would be fascinating because that's another example of plants absorbing complete compounds  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:10):**  rather than ions right and you know we're not again quite sure how this happens some of this  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:17):**  we do know is mediated by fungi especially root colonizing fungi either the arbuscular  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:24):**  mycorrhizal fungi or the ectomycorrhizal fungi so there's a compound that we started working with  
**[0:46:31-0:46:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:31):**  when i was still at the Rodale Institute called ergothein that has been found not just in plants  
**[0:46:38-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:38):**  but also in animal tissue and so in chicken livers in parts of animals that find its way into again  
**[0:46:50-0:46:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:50):**  what we're eating and it's because of the fact that those animals are eating plants that have  
**[0:46:59-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:46:59):**  high concentrations of these fungi growing in the soil and so you know being able to take a look at  
**[0:47:07-0:47:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:07):**  how we could enhance those relationships or what management techniques impact those relationships  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:15):**  and one of the things that we're starting to find when we look at those management impact  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:21):**  you know you're talking about these secondary compounds that are formed and again going back  
**[0:47:27-0:47:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:27):**  to this whole idea of carbon and where carbon flows and how carbon moves in the system  
**[0:47:35-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:35):**  what ends up happening especially on a microbial level and especially for fungi when your job  
**[0:47:47-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:47):**  is to your first primary job the first way in which you get paid from the plant is to satisfy  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:47:57):**  the nutrient needs of the plant the first thing you're going to do is make sure that you're  
**[0:48:04-0:48:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:04):**  going to do is make sure that you can provide the maximum amount of nutrients that the plant needs  
**[0:48:14-0:48:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:14):**  and I think that's always why things like the mycorrhizal fungi were tied to something like  
**[0:48:21-0:48:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:21):**  phosphorus because phosphorus was so unavailable in the soil and it was it's a it's a nutrient  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:30):**  unavailable and a nutrient that was something that the plant needed in abundance so it was  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:36):**  something that we could see a pretty direct relationship to when it came to some of the  
**[0:48:42-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:42):**  micronutrients and to water and some of the other things that mycorrhizal fungi also provide to the  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:49):**  plant that took a little bit more time and a little bit more research to take a look at that  
**[0:48:56-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:48:56):**  didn't mean that that's not as important as phosphorus it just meant that what we first  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:02):**  started looking at was phosphorus because again overall our focus when it came to plant nutrition  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:11):**  so much focus has always been on you know sort of the big three NPK nitrogen potassium and phosphorus  
**[0:49:18-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:18):**  yeah phosphorus was was always a tough one in the soil because it's immobile so you know that  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:28):**  became a big key so again you know kind of going back to that we just always did these studies  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:34):**  where it was you know you manipulate the concentration of phosphorus and you see how that  
**[0:49:40-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:40):**  affects colonization and you see how that affects plant growth and those types of things that are  
**[0:49:46-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:46):**  that are going on but we're starting to see now that other things are actually happening as well  
**[0:49:55-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:49:55):**  and again when the fungus is reliant upon satisfying nutrient needs the first thing  
**[0:50:04-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:04):**  the fungus is going to put energy into is creating a better hyphal network  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:12):**  extending that network as far as it needs to to make sure that it gets the nutrient demands  
**[0:50:19-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:19):**  satisfied so that it can then get as much carbon as it can and then if it has the network established  
**[0:50:29-0:50:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:29):**  well then it starts to do some of the secondary activity you can do things like enhancing that  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:39):**  network a little bit more making sure that part of that network has some rigidity to it so some  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:45):**  of the hyphae you'll invest a little bit more into making sure that some of the hyphae has  
**[0:50:51-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:51):**  some secondary compounds as part of the hyphal wall structure so it doesn't fall apart as easy  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:50:59):**  most of the hyphae when you first create it is very ephemeral it doesn't last very long  
**[0:51:04-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:04):**  you don't put a lot of energy into it and then you know you if it's going to stick around a little  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:10):**  bit longer you don't get as much disturbance with tillage or things like that then you build up a  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:16):**  more resilient network you start making soil aggregates with that more resilient network  
**[0:51:22-0:51:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:22):**  you start investing and releasing more carbohydrates more sugars to attract  
**[0:51:30-0:51:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:30):**  phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and consortia of other organisms creating what is referred to  
**[0:51:37-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:37):**  as sort of a mycorrhizosphere organisms around the fungal hyphae that starts to develop more  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:45):**  of the soil aggregate structure all of those things start happening part of creating that  
**[0:51:51-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:51:51):**  more rigid hyphal network is creating some of these secondary compounds so the formation on  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:00):**  the part of the arboreticular mycorrhizal fungi some of the initial work that I had done my PhD  
**[0:52:07-0:52:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:07):**  and masters on was looking at glomalin and glomalin is a glycoprotein produced by arboreticular  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:15):**  mycorrhizal fungi and what we found was that glomalin wasn't always immediately produced  
**[0:52:23-0:52:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:23):**  that the more that you had a system that was a no-till system or an undisturbed system that had  
**[0:52:33-0:52:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:33):**  perennial crops in it or that had cover crops in it the more glomalin you saw produced so it was  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:42):**  one of those secondary compounds it was kind of like you needed more carbon in order to be able  
**[0:52:49-0:52:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:49):**  to get it to be produced so again that makes sense it's a large complex biomolecule if the first  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:52:55):**  thing you need to do is make sure that you do your primary job which is getting nutrients  
**[0:53:01-0:53:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:01):**  you make a good network to get the nutrient if you make a good network then you now have  
**[0:53:07-0:53:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:07):**  the energy reserves you make secondary compounds and glomalin from the perspective of the fungus  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:17):**  helped with some of the hyphal wall rigidity it allows potentially allows the hyphae to penetrate  
**[0:53:24-0:53:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:24):**  air water interface zones those types of things so that was important to the hyphal structure  
**[0:53:33-0:53:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:33):**  and that is also something that we find those secondary compounds what they do for hyphal wall  
**[0:53:41-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:41):**  structure is also what helps to classify them as antioxidants and polyphenolics and some of the  
**[0:53:51-0:53:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:51):**  phytochemicals that are important for human cell wall integrity and some of our our own  
**[0:53:59-0:54:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:53:59):**  health benefits so this is what we're seeing yeah chris we you've we've spoken of a number  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:06):**  of different topics uh mycorrhizal fungi the soil microbiome many different pieces that have tied  
**[0:54:12-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:12):**  together and i'm certain that growers will want to explore some of these topics more deeply are  
**[0:54:19-0:54:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:19):**  there any resources that you recommend frequently to growers so i have uh you know i have some  
**[0:54:28-0:54:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:28):**  you know i have some different things and i i guess i encourage growers to go out there and  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:36):**  really kind of explore a number of different types of resources that are out there you know if you're  
**[0:54:42-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:42):**  interested in in some of these things i mean i do a lot of reading through scientific literature so  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:49):**  you can plug your way through scientific literature but there have been a few authors  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:54:55):**  that have done i think a good job of summarizing some things and they have some good references  
**[0:55:02-0:55:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:02):**  that will point you to some scientific literature and david montgomery is a very good author who does  
**[0:55:10-0:55:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:10):**  a good job of like i said having some good reference lists and judith schwartz who uh wrote  
**[0:55:18-0:55:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:18):**  a book called cows save the planet who also has done a book called water in plain sight which is a  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:25):**  really interesting book about some of these water relationships and some of these other issues that  
**[0:55:32-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:32):**  we touched on there again you know providing some reference materials and christen olson who did the  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:40):**  soil will save us has also done some work with that again providing some reference lists one of  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:46):**  the books that and this is a can be a little bit of a difficult book to to slug your way through  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:52):**  but it opens up some interesting topics to things one of the books that sort of was one of the topic  
**[0:55:59-0:56:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:55:59):**  areas or books that changed my life was a biogeochemistry book by um williams lessinger  
**[0:56:07-0:56:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:07):**  and what i like is these topics that interface not just biology but biology and chemistry  
**[0:56:17-0:56:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:17):**  and geology and physics i was just stating to a colleague of mine the other day that i consider  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:24):**  myself to be a physical biogeochemist because just being a soil scientist that's kind of what  
**[0:56:32-0:56:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:32):**  you have to do is look at all of these interfaces and so that's what i would encourage growers to do  
**[0:56:40-0:56:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:40):**  i've always thought of farmers ranchers and growers to be renaissance people that function  
**[0:56:48-0:56:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:48):**  at the interfaces of so many different occupations and so it's hard to point to one particular topic  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:56:58):**  but explore a number of different things and a number of different resources and how they all  
**[0:57:04-0:57:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/eliminating-the-need-for-synthetic-fertilizers-with-kris-nichols/#t=0:57:04):**  interface and work together wonderful chris thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and knowledge

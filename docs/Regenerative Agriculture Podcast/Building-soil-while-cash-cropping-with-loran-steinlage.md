**[0:00:05-0:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:10):**  health and public health.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:13):**  My guest for this episode is Lauren Steinloggy, who I had the privilege of meeting last winter  
**[0:00:17-0:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:17):**  at a conference.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:19):**  Lauren was kind enough to host us at his farm for our first two-day course earlier this  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  week.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  I had the privilege of getting to meet him and his family, spend some time on their farm  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:29):**  and learn more about some of the work they're doing to rapidly regenerate and rebuild soil  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  health and sequester a lot of carbon and grow some really healthy crops.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  Lauren, I'm really happy to have you here in the podcast.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  You've had an interesting story, personal journey with your own family and health challenges  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  that has then led you to begin farming very differently and adopt some practices that  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  were not at all being considered in mainstream agriculture at that moment in time.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  Can you tell us a little bit about your background and story and what brought you to some of  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  the things that you're working on today?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Lauren, what is the history of relay cropping on your farm?  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  When did you first begin adopting it and how did that come about?  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  Thank you for having us, first of all.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  Our history has just been kind of one of evolution, I would always call it.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  Early in the game, me and my wife always said it seemed about every time we get to the point  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  we thought we had things figured out, we'd have to re-engineer ourselves, just redefine  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  what we're doing.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  That goes all the way back to short history.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  When I was 14, I was hit broadside by a semi.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  Over the years, scar tissue led me to the point where I can't be around livestock because  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:51):**  I can actually pick up livestock disease and stuff like that.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:01:56):**  Growing up thinking I was going to be a livestock farmer, kind of was thrown out the window  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  pretty quick and I had the realization that I had to try to make it grain farming.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:06):**  In our area, the land rent, that's pretty competitive, so we always had to figure out  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  our little niche to try to make things work better.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  About the time we thought we had that figured out, picked up a lot of custom work.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  At one point, we were probably doing 1,500 acres of our own work and another 1,000 acres  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  of custom work through the custom planning, custom harvesting, crop care, all that stuff.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  At one point, I'd probably say I was a confirmed workaholic.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  Then 2008, my wife convinced me to finally take a vacation.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  I've never truly wanted to work since.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  At that point, I learned I had to work smarter, a fresh mind is way more competitive than  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  a tax help mind, which was fortunate because six months later, my son, Roland, was diagnosed  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  with a brain tumor.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:05):**  Suddenly we had to figure out how the farm was going to run with or without me because  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  the high priority was focused on our son.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  After that period, we learned what it was like, what people were really like when you  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  were in your worst of times.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  We started losing land just for a simple fact, landlords didn't want us to be overworked,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  which is a little scary because I never really thought I left off.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  I never backed off doing what we were doing.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  We tried to persevere, but we just had to get lean and mean.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  Mow continued, I guess is the way I always refer to it.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  Currently now our farm, strictly a row crop grain farm, but we do corn, beans, wheat,  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  rye, barley, buckwheat, got sunflowers this year, had some oats too.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  But then as history had shown, mother nature tends to throw us curve balls this year.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  Some of the relay cropping and that, we've had to pull the plug on a lot of that, even  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  the interceding.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:04):**  We had to pull the plug on that, just mother nature's got bats last, as a lot of people  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  like to say.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  So this year you're not doing any relay cropping, but in the prior years when you have been,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:17):**  what has your relay cropping been looking like?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  What crops are you relaying with each other?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:22):**  What does your overall relay rotation look like if it can be called that?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  It was kind of part of the evolution from, we started interceding 06, I believe it was  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  in 2012, the whole farm was strong corn on corn back in them days.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  So interceding was kind of my way into cover crops.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  We started through some of the people, the guy was meeting and stuff like that.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  I was introduced to a guy named John Kootz.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  And then another guy out in Nebraska that I was focused on was Shane Graving out there  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  and just started opening a line of communication with them.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  We had the equipment to intercede, well, it's the same equipment we needed to set up for  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:02):**  the relay cropping and that.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  John up there, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin has been at it.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  I'm going to guess he's pushing 15 years now that he's been doing it.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  Started looking at his system and quickly decided that was the guy I was truly going  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  to follow.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:17):**  Ended up even borrowing his original blocker guards.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  Started seeing what was happening there in our undulating terrain, having steel out in  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:28):**  front of the cutter bar was not a good option for me.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:30):**  So I quickly converted over to plastic pushers that we just made with a drainage tile.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  Then I converted over to bolt type, bolt on type blocker guard.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  But even that was limited because you start realizing we can't push the soybeans down.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:48):**  Now as of last year, we brought in the row crop head and was planning on running that  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  this year.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  But as I said earlier, mother nature kind of made sure we didn't have relay cropping  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  this year because May 15th, all our cereals were froze brown, laying flat on the ground.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  Biggest thing with relay cropping is it builds options into what we're doing.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  I guess that's what I like to reinforce to people.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  You mentioned just now that you're growing the rye for seed and in our conversation the  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:15):**  last couple of days, you described that the way relay cropping is sometimes done, it doesn't  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:20):**  produce a high enough quality crop to be produced for seed because it doesn't have enough uniform  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  germination and so forth.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:28):**  What are the important characteristics in your mind to make sure that relay cropping  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  does produce the same type of crop quality that just straight cropping might?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:36):**  The simplest setup is every fall all our acres has twin row cereals, either winter wheat  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Building_Soil_While_Cash_Cropping_with_Loran_Steinlage.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  or rye.

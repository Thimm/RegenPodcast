### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:52:19)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:00):**  Wheat producers get paid for quality based on protein content, test weight, and the sprouting  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:05):**  number.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:07):**  Bakers care about the quality of protein, not just the content, and it is expensive  
**[0:00:12-0:00:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:12):**  for them to overcome poor protein quality.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:15):**  In this interview, Claudia Carter describes the wheat characteristics that are actually  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:20):**  worth a premium to bakers.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:23):**  Welcome back to the Reconitive Agriculture podcast.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:26):**  I'm very delighted today to host Claudia Carter, who is the California Wheat Commissioner.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:32):**  Claudia and I have had several very interesting conversations recently around grain quality.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:38):**  Many of you know that I'm very passionate about producing healthy, high quality, nutritious  
**[0:00:42-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:42):**  food for people, and of course, we desire as producers to also be compensated for producing  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:50):**  a high quality product, and even for the quality of product that we produce today.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:53):**  We've had several quite interesting conversations with Claudia around what defines quality,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:00:58):**  how do we measure quality, what is the quality that is important to millers, to bakers, and  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:03):**  of course, what are the nutritional parameters that are important for us as consumers as  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:07):**  well.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:08):**  So, Claudia, welcome.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:09):**  I've been looking forward to this conversation.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:12):**  Thank you for being here.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:13):**  Can you tell us a bit about the journey and the pathway that has brought you to your work  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:17):**  as California Wheat Commissioner?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:18):**  Hi, John.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:20):**  Thank you for having me and the opportunity to discuss this important topic with your  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:25):**  audience.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:26):**  So, yeah, I actually came to the United States.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:29):**  I'm from Ecuador, originally, and I went to study food science at North Dakota State University.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:35):**  And after I graduated from, you know, with my undergraduate as a food scientist, I did  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:40):**  my master's degree in cereal science.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:43):**  And that's where really I learned a lot.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:45):**  I learned a lot more about grains.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:48):**  Specifically, I work with durum and understanding durum wheat and what makes high-quality durum  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:55):**  wheat for pasta manufacturers.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:01:58):**  And that's where all my journey begins with understanding more about wheat quality and  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:03):**  what it takes to produce, you know, a high-quality crop that will make a good product.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:09):**  Then California Wheat Commission as the lab director, and then I was promoted to be the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:14):**  executive director two years later once I joined here.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:18):**  And since then, I have been working for producers in California.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:22):**  What is the scope of the work that you're doing there at the Wheat Commission?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:25):**  Yeah, so there are two, you know, major missions that we work on as part of the California  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:34):**  Wheat Commission.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:35):**  And so under the research, we have a partnership with the University of California Davis, where  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:41):**  we have our wheat breeder, Dr. Jorge Dukovsky, who's breeding to improve not only, you know,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:47):**  the yields and also have this resistance added to the genetic background of the varieties,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:55):**  but also to improve the quality.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:02:59):**  And definitely working on bioportification of some of our wheat varieties.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:05):**  So that's what Dr. Dukovsky concentrates on.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:08):**  And then we also fund as part of the research, Dr. Mark Lundy, who is our small grains specialist.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:13):**  He's our agronomist who takes all the varieties and plants those across California to see  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:20):**  how they perform in different environments.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:23):**  And then he will be testing yield performance, the skis, persistence.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:28):**  And then, you know, besides the research that we do is market development.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:32):**  And market development, something unique on how we do it here in California is that among  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:37):**  all the 17 wheat commissions that United States have, California Wheat Commission is the only  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:42):**  one that has a wheat quality research lab on the side.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:46):**  So we can process all those samples that we get from the research side from UC Davis and  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:51):**  process them here for testing for quality, you know, for bread, tortillas, pastas, you  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:56):**  name it.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:03:57):**  We can make any product here.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:00):**  So you've mentioned a couple of words that, one word in particular that I don't hear very  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:04):**  often, the word biofortification.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:07):**  So in the agricultural community, particularly in the food and vegetable production community,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:12):**  it's common to hear conversations around nutrient density.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:17):**  And I think the idea of producing biofortified foods where we actually are breeding for a  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:24):**  specific nutritional profile is not something that is widely discussed.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:28):**  Can you tell me a bit more about your efforts and what your objectives are in that area?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:33):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:34):**  So I'll tell you what, you know, from Dr. Dukovsky's perspective, but also a little  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:40):**  bit from my perspective.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:42):**  So Dr. Dukovsky, as part of this industry, is asked by many people in this case to say  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:50):**  the growers develop varieties that are, you know, are going to be resilient, but then  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:04:55):**  also he's been asked things from the millers and from the bakers, hey, develop varieties  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:00):**  that have these quality parameters, right?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:02):**  And one of the things that the millers have always asked, we want less mineral.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:08):**  Because, you know, minerals going to affect the white flower performance for certain products.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:15):**  So Dr. Dukovsky said to me one time, why do we want that?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:19):**  Because we want to keep high minerals, high nutritious wheat.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:24):**  So with that being said, Dr. Dukovsky's efforts and became one of his, you know, project back,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:31):**  you know, about 10 years ago, in half some wheat that is biofortified, meaning that has  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:38):**  higher stinks, or higher, in this case, a variety that we are currently developed or  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:44):**  I'm sorry, it will be commercially available.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:46):**  It's half that has high carotenoid pigments.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:49):**  So that means, you know, you have high lutein, which at the end will help, you know, it will  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:54):**  be good for your eyes.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:05:56):**  So it's something that it became some sort of a passion for Dr. Dukovsky to develop varieties  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:02):**  that are going to be better for you.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:04):**  You know, he knew that we need to have more of these in our food.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:10):**  And why would I follow that?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:12):**  And I think he was right.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:14):**  You know, I think he's developing those varieties that in the long run, and as you see people  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:19):**  do not, you know, people asking for healthier products, I think we're on the right track.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:24):**  And anything that Dr. Dukovsky does, he does communicate with us.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:29):**  And in a way, we say that that's along the mission and the things that we would like  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:34):**  to see being produced here in California.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:37):**  I find it interesting in that the parameters that the millers are looking for, as in less  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:43):**  ash and a smaller mineral content, is in some ways in direct conflict with the quality that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:49):**  we should really value collectively as consumers and as society.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:54):**  I wonder about other areas of possible conflict.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:06:58):**  What are the differences in the protein value, gluten content?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:01):**  What is the story behind gluten?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:03):**  So protein content, how can I, okay, so we understand protein content and protein quality  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:11):**  are completely different.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:12):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:13):**  Just because you have a high protein content, that doesn't mean that you have actually good  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:18):**  bread quality, protein quality.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:21):**  And there is a research that came out from one of my professors from NDSU, Dr. Shimshik,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:29):**  that proves that varieties that were bred or having in our system for so many years  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:35):**  and the new varieties, the gluten structure hasn't changed.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:39):**  So, and people think that the gluten that used to be in varieties that they will call  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:45):**  heritage wheat varieties.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:47):**  So the right thing to say about gluten is that gluten is actually the protein in wheat  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:54):**  is actually two proteins, that is glutensin and gliadin.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:07:58):**  That when you have it in the grain, make that grain into produce it into flour and you add  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:04):**  water to it without even mixing, then gluten structure and matrix starts to form disulfide  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:13):**  bonds that come together.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:15):**  And that's when we can tell and say, okay, a gluten structure or matrix has been formed.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:22):**  So when people are studying, if something has changed in the protein, in the gluten  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:28):**  structure, really what we're studying is the gliadin and the glutenin, which each of those  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:34):**  proteins provide a specific type of structure and quality to the bread that you're making.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:41):**  So one will provide you, in this case, the glutensin will provide what we call an elasticity  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:48):**  type of component, which is resistance to expand.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:52):**  And then the gliadins are going to provide what we call extensibility to produce the  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:08:57):**  gluten structure that are going to help to maintain a nice local bread that will entrap  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:03):**  those gas bubbles through the presentation process.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:05):**  So when we talk about gluten, that really is what it is.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:09):**  It's a protein, it provides a structure to the bread.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:11):**  It also is going to provide that protein nutritious factor that we need to have.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:19):**  So thinking about gluten versus gliadin from a growing, from an agronomic perspective,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:26):**  what can growers and agronomists do to produce not just higher protein content, but also  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:33):**  a higher protein quality?  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:35):**  And I think actually there's another question that almost comes before that, which is what  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:39):**  defines protein quality?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:40):**  You said that protein quantity and quality are two very different things.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:44):**  Are we looking for a balance between gluten and gliadin?  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:47):**  Correct.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:48):**  So the protein that you have in the grain for wheat, 80%, which are glutensin and gliadin,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:09:55):**  and about 20% are what we call the non-gluten forming proteins, which are alumin, globulin,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:01):**  and tritosins, right?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:02):**  So you do have certain balance between the gliadins and the glutensins that it's part  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:10):**  of its genetic background.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:12):**  So this is where genetics are very, very important in the wheat produce, which we have to make  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:19):**  sure to understand that only 30% of the quality is explained by the genetic part.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:25):**  And then 70% is everything else that we don't control, right?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:29):**  Which is, or some could control, I guess, if you're in the desert producing a crop where  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:34):**  you can control how you manage your crop.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:36):**  But most of the wheat that is grown is a dry land crop.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:40):**  And then, you know, you don't control that part of how much water you're going to get  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:43):**  or how much water you're not going to get.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:45):**  Yet the part that the user can control, which is management.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:49):**  And this is not my area of expertise.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:51):**  However, I have heard and listened enough, Dr. Lundy, when he explains that management  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:10:56):**  and nitrogen application, for example, and the timing of nitrogen application is so important  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:03):**  to produce not only that high protein content, but also the deposition of the protein that  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:09):**  is going to affect that protein quality.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:12):**  So, and everything else that you have, you know, the sulfur, is it magnesium, is it all  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:18):**  those and you don't want to have a deficit of these key component elements that the crop  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:24):**  is going to need to do that protein deposition.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:28):**  But 30%, and this is something to me very important for the grower to understand, that  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:32):**  30% is explained by genetics.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:34):**  So having a good genetic background that comes with that variety that you're planting is  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:39):**  key, you know, of course, as well as your management and then your environment that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:43):**  you're having.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:45):**  How have genetics shifted and changed over the last few decades?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:49):**  Are genetics really being optimized for the optimal protein quality instead of just protein  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:55):**  quantity?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:11:56):**  I would say in general, most of the research, you know, the breeding research programs,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:03):**  they pay up the protein content.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:05):**  However, yield potential continues being a very, very important part of the breeding  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:11):**  program.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:13):**  Because at the end of the day, the grower gets paid on yield and the protein content,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:18):**  they're trying to make it as good as possible, but they do want to see high yield.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:23):**  So protein quality in California in the breeding program, yes, I will say, you know, we have  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:29):**  been heavily investing in that.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:32):**  And also the way I hear Dr. Dukovsky describe these is that they have tools now that they  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:39):**  can utilize and breed varieties in a much faster way than they used to be able to do  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:44):**  it, you know, in 20, 30 years ago.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:47):**  So it has changed, yes, because technology has advanced, so you can do things quicker,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:52):**  faster.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:53):**  There is a lot of things to understand about the wheat genome, because it's, you know,  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:58):**  it's just huge.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:12:59):**  But we have done advancements to understand what are the areas in the blue penning part,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:04):**  for example, that are the high molecular weight that we might be able to concentrate on that  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:10):**  gives elasticity and how can we come to be breeding for quality, high quality, high elastic  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:16):**  breeds that are going to be stronger, for example.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:20):**  And that's something that Dr. Dukovsky here at our breeding program has been doing and  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:25):**  developing.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:26):**  I find it very encouraging that protein quality is only 30% genetics and is 70% environment.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:35):**  Obviously you could, we could perceive that as being a double-edged sword, but if 70%  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:40):**  of protein quality is determined by management and determined by the plant's environment,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:44):**  that actually means that we have a significant influence over quality.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:48):**  And I think in growers that we have worked with, we've certainly observed that timing  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:53):**  of nitrogen application, as you mentioned, but also magnesium, sulfur, molybdenum, all  
**[0:13:57-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:13:57):**  of the enzyme cofactors that are needed for protein synthesis and for the nitrate and  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:05):**  ammonia metabolism within the plant are very important.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:08):**  And certainly from a plant health perspective, they give us much greater degrees of pest  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:13):**  resistance and overall plant vigor, and they generally translate to increased yield as  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:18):**  well.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:19):**  And I heard you mentioned some of those minerals and the way that they correspond to quality.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:24):**  Is that also because of the protein synthesis and enzyme cofactor pathways?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:29):**  You know, you're getting into an area that is not my expertise, but the way I hear our  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:33):**  agronomist speaking is that, you know, all those other, you know, elements that you are,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:41):**  you know, feeding your plants are going to definitely influence at the end of the day,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:45):**  the overall quality you get from that crop.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:48):**  And not just that, I mean, yield potential, right?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:51):**  And what you just say, like certain times, you know, maybe the disease resistance and  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:56):**  that to be a healthy crop, right?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:14:58):**  That would be just what you just described.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:00):**  Claudia, you have an interesting perspective in that you speak not only with growers and  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:06):**  agronomists, but also with the millers and the bakers.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:08):**  One of the questions that I often wonder about is how are the interests of and the desires  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:15):**  of the millers and the growers aligned or misaligned?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:21):**  One of those areas, so I have seen a lack of communication and why I have become a pretty  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:29):**  big advocate of let's bring every single player to the table.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:35):**  I have reached out to millers and say, we're here to help you come and tell us what do  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:39):**  you want?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:40):**  What do you need?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:41):**  And the same thing, the farmer, the farmers say, I want a miller to come and see what  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:45):**  I do on my farm.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:47):**  I want a baker to come and see what I do, you know, and the other way around is the  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:51):**  truth.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:52):**  The miller wants to, you know, hopefully talk to the farmer and say, okay, let me learn.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:15:57):**  You know, the farmer is saying, I want to learn from you and why my quality affects  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:00):**  you.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:01):**  So they want different things and that's the problem because the market, how it is  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:06):**  structured, you know, I say, what does the farmer care about in the weed market?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:12):**  Well, they care about what crossing content they reach, the test way, for example, and  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:18):**  then another factor that is right now being affected up in the Midwest, they're being  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:22):**  discounted on polling numbers, which basically is, you know, sprout damage because of the  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:28):**  rains that they have, they have in North Dakota, Montana.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:31):**  So it's a factor then because of the issues, then they're being discounted.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:36):**  So, and then the elevator is going to care pretty much the same three things, crossing  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:41):**  content, test weight and polling number, but then the miller and the baker, oh my goodness,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:46):**  they do have to care about a lot about the quality.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:49):**  They do want a high stability, pre-initiative stability that is going to perform very well  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:16:55):**  in the mixer and they want, you know, some of them want flavor, the other ones want high  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:00):**  absorption.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:01):**  So you have a list that is, you know, so long for these other people on the supply chain  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:06):**  that doesn't really match with what the farmer's looking at and what the elevator's looking  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:11):**  at.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:12):**  Yes, I always say, but you're demanding that from the farmer and yet you're discounting  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:17):**  a lot on the farm and when they do something right, you don't give them that incentive  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:22):**  and that premium and that disconnect is really becoming a little bit more of a, of an issue  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:30):**  right now.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:31):**  The baker wants to clean that label up, wants to have less ingredients and they cannot find  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:37):**  a good quality wheat.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:38):**  So it's a major issue, I would say, in an industry as a whole.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:43):**  I'd love for you to expand on that last comment just a little bit because we, I think many  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:48):**  growers, many producers are beginning to, in their own personal life, really understand  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:54):**  the importance of personal health and buying food that you can actually understand all  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:17:59):**  the, pronounce all the ingredients on the label.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:02):**  So when wheat is poor quality, our millers and bakers, they need to add more ingredients  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:08):**  to the recipe and how does wheat quality change what goes into bread?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:14):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:16):**  So if you are able to control what you're getting for wheat and you're able to hand  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:23):**  pick varieties and regions and areas where you want to get your wheat from to mill it,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:29):**  to give it to a baker, you're going to be a leader in this industry.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:35):**  The current market doesn't really work much that way.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:38):**  I mean, because they're segregating this from protein content, right?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:42):**  So okay.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:43):**  Let's say you have a lower quality, a much shorter mix time for a flour that the baker  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:50):**  is using.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:52):**  And when you're putting that into a machine, because big bakeries, they're not hand making  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:58):**  the bread.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:18:59):**  They have machines that pretty much it's all automatic.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:02):**  They put the flour, the ingredients come, they get dumped, they get mixed, it goes through  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:07):**  a pipe and goes through the next level.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:10):**  So when you are working in such an automated type of system, you want to make sure that  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:17):**  you have a mix of dough that is not going to be sticking to your pipes or sticking to  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:22):**  your machine because then you have a big issue.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:25):**  So what you have to add to that mix of ingredients are extra of that mix of the blend is extra  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:34):**  ingredients that are willing to help you to keep things together.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:38):**  And often to compensate for quality, what bakers have to add is an ingredient that's  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:45):**  called beta-weteutin.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:46):**  So beta-weteutin is basically a protein isolate.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:51):**  So it's a protein that gets extracted from the wheat and then that protein can be added  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:19:57):**  to the blend so you can have a more consistent type of flour from batch to batch to batch.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:04):**  So the problem is that that ingredient is expensive.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:07):**  So I say, if you have a flour that you like and it's okay quality, you're paying about  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:13):**  17 cents a pound.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:15):**  Well, then you need to pay about a dollar per pound for beta-weteutin.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:20):**  That's very expensive.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:21):**  And if you have to add more of that ingredient rather than having a high quality flour that  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:26):**  perhaps you're paying a premium for, let's say you're paying a premium instead of 17  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:30):**  cents, you're paying 25 to 30 cents, you're still saving money because you are going to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:36):**  have a much more even consistent flour quality than having to add those ingredients such  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:42):**  as beta-weteutin.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:43):**  It seems to me like it would be a really big deal for millers and for bakers to desire  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:52):**  to have, essentially, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're describing that when  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:20:56):**  you have really high quality wheat, you don't need to add the expensive ingredients and  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:00):**  of course produce higher quality wheat and be compensated for that.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:05):**  So from your perspective, you have a very strategic viewpoint.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:09):**  Where is the disconnect coming from?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:11):**  The supply chain and how our industry has been working for years and the resistance  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:18):**  to change.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:19):**  Okay.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:20):**  Our system is not set up for the way I just described to you.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:25):**  You know, however, the bakers want to have that, yet, you know, the people who go from  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:31):**  the farmer all the way to the baker just haven't figured out yet how to make that happen for  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:38):**  a customer who is demanding that.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:40):**  So I will tell you the impediments that we have is how we deal from the crop, from its  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:46):**  harvest to the point that it gets sent to the bakery.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:49):**  Everybody in between hasn't changed and it's really difficult for them to change in a system  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:55):**  that is set up for many years.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:21:57):**  It has been working, which is mainly getting paid by protein content and how big of your  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:02):**  kernels are and do you have any, you know, scratch damage and what I just told you.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:07):**  But let me give you an example of an industry.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:09):**  I was in Spain two years ago and I went to visit a farmer there, a wheat farmer in Spain  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:14):**  and you know, they had a wheat field there and I asked, I'm always very curious how other  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:21):**  other growers or other parts of the world are growing and marketing their wheat.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:26):**  So I asked this grower and I say, so how do you sell this wheat and what do you get from  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:31):**  that wheat?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:32):**  So he pulled out his cell phone and showed me and he goes, well, first I have to harvest  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:39):**  it.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:40):**  After I harvest it, I have to send it to a wheat quality lab and as he pulled out his  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:44):**  phone, his cell phone, he showed me a spreadsheet where he has the data that he gets.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:50):**  He gets moisture content, protein content, very few people might know what it is, which  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:22:56):**  is an allograft data and that allograft data, what really tells you in short term is quality  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:02):**  of the wheat.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:03):**  It gives you a W value, which is the overall work of that dough when it got into the machine  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:09):**  and the higher the W value, I mean more likely the better the quality.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:14):**  And he told me, he said, if my W value is higher than 200, I get paid a premium for  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:20):**  it.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:21):**  And I was in shock.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:22):**  I was like, I never really had a producer really telling me something like dough quality  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:29):**  and that they get paid a premium for that quality.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:33):**  So that doesn't happen in the US unfortunately, because you don't have the buyer telling the  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:39):**  producer I'm going to pay you on quality.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:43):**  It seems to me though, from what you expressed earlier, that the buyers, I mean, it would  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:47):**  make sense that they would have a desire to do that.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:50):**  It would be economically worthwhile.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:52):**  They would have an incentive to do that if the supply team were capable of delivering  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:55):**  that.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:56):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:23:58):**  We've touched on a number of different subjects that all connect together, but I think before  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:04):**  we unravel them further, there is something that I know many people would like me to ask.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:10):**  And that is when we consider protein quality, gluten versus gliadin and these various compounds,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:17):**  there's a lot of discussion.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:20):**  And I would almost say bordering on a fad around gluten sensitivity.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:24):**  Some of it certainly is real.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:26):**  Some of it is questionable whether it's real.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:28):**  But from your perspective, you mentioned earlier the differences between heritage grains and  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:35):**  the more modern grain varieties.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:38):**  If I'm understanding correctly, then essentially you're saying that gluten is present even  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:42):**  in the heritage grains, but there are differences in quality.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:46):**  What's really going on?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:48):**  So the structure or the genetic part of the structure of those two gliadins and glutenins  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:55):**  and the genetic makeup of those lines are different.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:24:59):**  This is what I read.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:00):**  This is what I hear.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:02):**  And so let's go back to what I told you before, which is very important as explained here.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:08):**  Tannins provide elasticity.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:10):**  And if you talk about elasticity, to put it in a way that everybody will understand what  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:14):**  I mean, it's a resistance to the formation.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:17):**  So if you take a rubber band that is very strong and you stretch it and you let it go,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:22):**  it's going back to its original place, well, that's elasticity.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:25):**  Now tannins that provides that component.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:29):**  The gliadins provide what we call extensibility.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:33):**  And it's basically the ability of something to stretch.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:37):**  So when you see the quality differences between the heritage grains, you are going to have  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:44):**  a much higher influence of the gliadins, which are the ones that have that extensibility.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:51):**  So they're going to be stickier.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:53):**  Okay, they're not going to have that springing back that the elasticity glutenins provide.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:25:58):**  This is just talking from quality perspective and the way I see it, or we see it in the  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:03):**  lab.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:04):**  But in contrast with the newer varieties that have been bred for having that stronger, much  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:11):**  more elastic type of strength, then the glutenins are going to dominate and certain parts of  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:19):**  the glutenins because we're providing and allowing it to fit as part of that.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:24):**  Again, this is part of the genetic, the 70% comes from other things about management,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:28):**  we talk about that.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:29):**  So if we talk about the quality per se of the differences between those two, you have  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:35):**  the heritage grains that are a bit stickier and a bit more soft, rather than the newer  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:42):**  ones that became to be higher elasticity.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:45):**  But also keep in mind that these newer varieties, modern varieties are also being bred to be  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:52):**  harder.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:26:53):**  So you not only have a stronger quality, but also you have a harder kernel that when you  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:00):**  break it, it's going to be harder to break.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:04):**  And that we call a harness value.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:05):**  Whereas the other ones, the heritage are much on the softer side, which it really is what  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:10):**  a lot of these heritage means have been, or are like one of the ones that many people  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:15):**  understand and know.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:17):**  Yet people have used it for bread baking and that's the scenario we have been in California  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:21):**  and it came from Mexico and was produced here a long, long time ago.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:26):**  We still produce it, but that's the differences in what we see from the quality perspective,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:31):**  from the heritage and the modern wheat.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:34):**  When growers want to test their wheat quality, similar to the farmer that you met in Spain,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:42):**  where can farmers in North America send their wheat to get tested and to be analyzed for  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:47):**  quality, as you're describing?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:50):**  So we have, I mean, the California Wheat Commission has a feed for service lab.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:27:55):**  So we have some producers from California that take their wheat here and then we test  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:00):**  it for quality here.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:02):**  And they are the ones, very progressive growers that we have working directly with us who  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:07):**  are working with customers directly.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:10):**  And they're the ones looking at quality data, right?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:13):**  The other labs that I know is the Wheat Marketing Center up in Portland.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:18):**  You have the Great Plains Lab in Kansas and then you have the one up in North Dakota that's  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:24):**  called the Northern Crops Institute.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:26):**  So those are the main labs that I know that test wheat quality and that producers can  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:31):**  send their samples to.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:34):**  And are there different types of parameters that can be measured?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:38):**  Are there any specific requests that growers should ask for or just a simple wheat quality  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:42):**  assay will give them the type of information that you're talking about?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:47):**  Yeah, you can have basic quality data.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:50):**  One of the most widely known quality tests that anybody will ask you is the Pharynograph.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:28:57):**  The Pharynograph will give you stability and absorption.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:01):**  And stability, what that means is how long can I mix my dough before it starts breaking  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:05):**  down and becoming sticky?  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:07):**  The longer the stability is, the stronger that wheat is.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:10):**  So it's like very good.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:12):**  And the shorter, the weaker that is.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:13):**  So it's a pretty straightforward test.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:15):**  Another component that that test gives you is absorption.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:19):**  And absorption, as we all know, is important for a baker because higher absorption means  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:23):**  that the baker can push a little bit that hydration, add more water.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:27):**  Well, you know, adding water for the baker is a plus because water is cheap.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:32):**  So then they will be able to understand like how much more water I can add to this product.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:36):**  So I would say Pharynograph is the quality testing that I will encourage growers to go  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:42):**  for and of course, protein content just to have an idea of protein content.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:45):**  It will be also good to have.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:49):**  One of the questions that's circulating in my mind, we work with a number of growers  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:54):**  in Kansas and in the Northwest who are very passionate about the work that they're doing.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:29:59):**  They desire to produce healthier, higher quality grains.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:02):**  What can they do to help resolve the pipeline challenges, the supply chain challenges?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:09):**  Is it possible in today's world to connect directly with bakers and shepherd your grain  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:14):**  throughout the entire process?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:17):**  What can growers begin thinking about or begin doing differently to really be compensated  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:22):**  for quality that they're producing?  
**[0:30:24-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:24):**  So I would say the way that we have been working with here in California, and I think it will  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:32):**  work until we get up to the point is that the producers themselves have a good connection  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:40):**  with a miller slash baker that we directly to.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:45):**  And honestly, it's more like setting that new business model for grain buying and selling,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:54):**  setting that model as almost like a case study.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:30:57):**  You know, I have been doing it with this mill and this baker and it's working.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:02):**  Sometimes when you start developing programs like that, they start very small, which is  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:07):**  what we're seeing here in California.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:09):**  We're starting very small where we have a producer who said here in Sacramento area,  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:14):**  one of my producers at Chills from Chills Farm said, hey, you know, I want to be able  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:20):**  to market my old grain.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:21):**  So what did he do?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:23):**  And he set up his own cleaning facility, grain cleaning facility, packaging and storage.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:28):**  So now he has had a great success story where he is selling directly to a manufacturer.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:37):**  Then he's also selling it directly to a mill in LA who is buying directly his Tricky Kelly,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:42):**  for example.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:43):**  So having those additional component of his processing for the farmer, it's a key part  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:50):**  of moving that needle into the right direction.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:54):**  Also growers, what they can do is if they have a storage ability, they can also start  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:31:59):**  testing their quality and then storing the weed by quality.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:03):**  But of course, they need to know, so where am I going to sell these?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:07):**  So where am I going to, so that's the part that we're missing.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:09):**  Like how can we connect that grower with somebody who wants that?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:12):**  So it's a difficult situation for many growers, but there are some growers who are already  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:19):**  starting to make those changes at the farm level, as well as making the connection going  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:25):**  to trade shows, talking to investors and being in front of the line saying, I'm producing  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:31):**  these, do you want it?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:32):**  Do you need it?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:34):**  Because I don't want to go and deal with anybody else or my elevator.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:37):**  I want to deal directly with you.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:39):**  So being out there learning directly from their customers and what they need and starting  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:45):**  to make those connections are very, very critical.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:48):**  That's what I will say that they can start doing and what I have seen.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:51):**  The other thing that I've seen growers here in California and other places is setting  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:55):**  up their own mill.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:32:56):**  So I have currently two growers who have set their own cleaning facility and also they're  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:03):**  going to put a mill.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:04):**  They're going to start milling in smaller batches, but they're going to be selling their  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:07):**  own flour very soon.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:10):**  I think this, what you're describing really speaks to one of the foundational challenges  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:15):**  that we need growers.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:17):**  And this is certainly true of wheat as well as the other crops have really become commodity  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:20):**  producers.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:21):**  They're producing commodities and they are allowing others to add value and to extract  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:29):**  a lot of the value from the commodity that they're producing.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:31):**  And so bringing back those roles that have been delegated to people referred to as middlemen  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:36):**  and adding that additional value can be one way of adding a lot of value to a farming  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:41):**  enterprise as a whole.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:42):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:44):**  Yep.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:45):**  And some of those producers are starting to realize that I have to do it myself because  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:51):**  they have told me I have gone knocking the doors and zero response.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:33:56):**  So then I had to invest on my own milling facility.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:01):**  I want to be able to tell a story, why am I doing this?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:04):**  And the other component of the story of grains is let's produce healthy products, which to  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:10):**  me is whole grain products.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:12):**  I don't want to tell you not to eat gluten, but I want to tell you why you should be eating  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:17):**  whole grain bread products because they're so good for you and for your health.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:22):**  When you ask me about that question and the people who are avoiding gluten, it's fine.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:27):**  Everybody can have their own choices.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:29):**  I have my own choices, but I will tell them, I say, try to have a good whole grain bread,  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:36):**  a good whole grain cracker.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:38):**  You're going to fall in love again with grains and with gluten because they add flavor, they  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:43):**  add nutrition, and you are not going to walk away from those.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:47):**  Unfortunately, those products, there are some in the market, but not widely, I would say,  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:52):**  developed or produced in the US.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:34:54):**  You can find outstanding whole grain, 100% whole grain products in Germany, in Italy,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:01):**  in France.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:02):**  They are good quality products, but yet I think we're lacking here in the US to have  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:07):**  more 100% whole grain products.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:09):**  Let's talk about whole grain just a little bit because I think this is also an important  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:14):**  conversation.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:15):**  It's a very familiar one for me because I grew up in a family where we made our own  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:18):**  bread and we actually milled our own grain.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:21):**  It was 100% whole grain.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:24):**  What's the relative nutritional value of bran versus white flour that has had the bran removed  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:31):**  from it?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:32):**  Okay, let's talk about what does the wheat have.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:36):**  The wheat have bran, germ, and then the endosperm.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:39):**  Endosperm is mainly basically the starch and then the gluten-forming protein.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:45):**  Then the bran, you have the insoluble fiber and vitamins and minerals, very, very important  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:50):**  for mainly the fat, but also some other important vitamins.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:35:57):**  When you are eating 100% whole grain as part of the whole thing, yes, you're adding that  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:03):**  portion, one of the key portions I would say, which is fiber.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:07):**  You want to eat more whole grains because of that insoluble fiber that we should be  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:13):**  eating more in our diet, but also those vitamins and minerals that come with it.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:19):**  I was at a meeting recently and I heard from some of the experts in nutrition in the whole  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:24):**  grains that yes, whole grains will provide you all that, yet we should have still, even  
**[0:36:29-0:36:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:29):**  whole grain flour, should still be fortified with these other vitamins, fortified because  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:39):**  it will be very important to continue having that as part of a healthy program that the  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:45):**  US is encouraging.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:46):**  Yes, you're adding a lot more nutrition with whole grain than white flour, but still there  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:52):**  is some sort of a unique perspective that we still should be fortifying that whole grain  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:36:58):**  flour in the US, which we do for the white flour because you're stripping really literally  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:04):**  all those nutrients that it's getting out from the bran and the white flour is purely  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:10):**  starch with some of that protein that is the gluten.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:14):**  Then they have to fortify it and start fortifying it, which was a big major advantage in our  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:21):**  health in the US when they started doing that.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:24):**  There are advantages today to fortifying grain as you described and to an earlier part of  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:31):**  our conversation where you describe how historically, if I understood it correctly, breeding efforts  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:36):**  historically and even today are attempting to produce a low ash, low mineral content  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:41):**  grain.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:42):**  One of the questions that I think would arise from that is how does the nutrient level and  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:50):**  mineral and vitamin level of more modern varieties compare with those that were not particularly  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:57):**  bred for a low ash content?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:37:59):**  In general, what we have seen in the lab, heritage varieties, older varieties tend to  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:05):**  have a higher mineral ash content than some of them, not all of them, but some of the  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:12):**  newer varieties.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:14):**  When we are even talking about the whole grain, so there is more, I would say, I guess, mineral  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:19):**  content concentrated and just speaking as a hypothesis, not that I have done any research  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:24):**  on it, but by fact, we have done that testing and we know that there are differences in  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:29):**  mineral content.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:30):**  Keep in mind that the varieties that are bred today are bred for mainly for the milling  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:36):**  and baking industry that exists, which is mainly white flour.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:41):**  What really we have come to try to do is try to be able to do as efficient as possible  
**[0:38:47-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:47):**  in the roller milling system to detach, to take away, to rip off the bran.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:54):**  By doing so, we are making sure that there is zero contamination from the bran, which  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:38:59):**  has most of that mineral content and the ash content that came mainly from the bran, that  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:05):**  it basically doesn't contaminate the endosperm, which is what we're using for making the white  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:10):**  flour.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:12):**  That has also been the case that we're able, in the modern wheat, you're able to mill it  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:18):**  to have a much more efficient milling capacity so you have higher flour yield without having  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:25):**  too much of that contamination from the bran.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:27):**  That really is what I would say the difference is that you cannot perhaps accomplish well  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:32):**  with your heritage varieties that are smaller kernels, more pinch kernels, so through the  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:37):**  milling process, efficiency is not as good.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:40):**  But as I said, if our goal and our goal should be to feed and have more whole grain flours,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:46):**  at the end of the day, you do want to have those varieties that contain that higher mineral  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:51):**  that are good for you.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:53):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:54):**  Claudia, what are some resources that you would recommend if growers, producers, agronomists  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:39:59):**  want to follow up and to learn more about quality and how to connect directly with bakers?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:06):**  Are there any resources that you would recommend for them to look at?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:09):**  We put some things in our website so I can recommend them to go to our website, which  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:15):**  is the californiaweed.org website.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:18):**  So there is also resources from the universities.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:22):**  I would say the Washington State University has a wonderful resources on quality that  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:26):**  they put into their website, North Dakota State University and Kansas State University.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:31):**  So those would be the other places where they will have information about quality.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:37):**  And I would say there is also the wheat food council or the whole grain, I went blank on  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:44):**  that name, but it's a whole grain council, I think it is called too, where they can find  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:49):**  information about wheat and wheat quality and nutrition information as well.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:55):**  Very good.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:40:56):**  Are there any other things that growers should be thinking about?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:01):**  What is the question that I should have been asking?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:04):**  You know, I would say are they, I mean growers are doing, and this I know by fact, they're  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:10):**  doing the best they can to produce, you know, in the area how they can produce it.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:15):**  So the question will be, should we adjust and change the ways that we're farming today?  
**[0:41:22-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:22):**  And this is a difficult one that might give me an advantage in a way to continue protecting  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:30):**  the soil.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:31):**  I mean, I have heard some of our growers who are changing, let's say to no-till here in  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:37):**  our area and they're changing to other things like cover crops.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:43):**  So I would say encourage the growers to ask the questions and I don't want to, you know,  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:48):**  as I say, I don't tell them what to do, but yet I want to have them and challenge them  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:52):**  to ask the questions.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:53):**  Is it what we're doing?  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:41:54):**  Is it what we should be continuing doing or are there other ways that we can keep producing  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:00):**  a high quality, high nutritious crop that will provide me an advantage, an advantage  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:06):**  to the soil and to the way I'm farming?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:08):**  Yeah, I think that's certainly the agronomic focus is one that we speak about primarily  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:14):**  here on the podcast and on our webinars is how do we develop agricultural systems and  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:19):**  soil and crop management systems that enhance biology and that produce healthier and higher  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:25):**  quality crops and more nutritious food.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:27):**  That of course ranges from using cover crops to using biological inoculants and a completely  
**[0:42:33-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:33):**  different set of management practices in many different cases.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:35):**  Yeah, and also do I have to be looking for new partners?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:40):**  I think, you know, just finding that status quo, keep looking for other outlets.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:45):**  There are companies out there that are looking for farmers who are going to be partnering  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:50):**  with them.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:51):**  And this is what I say.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:52):**  I say, look at your farmer as your partner and the farmer will look at that industry  
**[0:42:57-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:42:57):**  and that person working for that industry also as a partner.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:00):**  We got to help each other.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:02):**  I think collaboration is going to continue to be very, very important.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:05):**  But also I tell them knowledge sharing, let's share the knowledge.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:09):**  And that's something the producers do very good.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:12):**  They share knowledge with their fellow growers.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:13):**  They tell them what they're doing.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:14):**  Yet in other areas of the supply chain, we lack.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:18):**  We don't want to share what we know.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:20):**  And that shouldn't be that way.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:21):**  Yeah, I've certainly observed that as well.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:23):**  Very clearly.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:24):**  Claudia, this has been a wonderful conversation.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:27):**  I'm sure that our listeners will enjoy it very much as well.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:30):**  Thank you for being here.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:31):**  And I look forward to having more discussions in the future.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/#t=0:43:34):**  Thank you, John.

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-08-10)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf, hosting this podcast.  I am passionate about developing regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant to diseases and insects, and produce fruit  
**[0:00:13-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:13):**  of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate conversation about growing  food as medicine.  I've discovered that there are many people with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:24-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:24):**  about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative agriculture systems.  However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered, it's found all over the place.  Some of it has been published in peer reviewed publications, but there are many incredible  
**[0:00:39-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:39):**  stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published and that hasn't been shared  with many people.  I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to bring this knowledge together in a more  
**[0:00:51-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:51):**  coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems that growers can easily  put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally  
**[0:01:03-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:03):**  and become the mainstream, the status quo against which all other growing systems are  compared.  To help achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge that we have learned in the  
**[0:01:14-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:14):**  last decade and make it available to everyone.  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles  
**[0:01:26-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:26):**  can be applied anywhere and when they are applied properly, they will always increase  farm profitability and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments or ideas, topics that you would like for me  
**[0:01:41-0:01:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:41):**  to discuss, please connect on LinkedIn or on Twitter where my username is at visionbuilder7  or you can also email me at john at johnkempf.com.  I would very much like to hear from you and to hear your feedback.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:57):**  Be sure to subscribe to this podcast and thank you very much for listening.  Enjoy the show.  Hi friends.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:02):**  This podcast is a little bit different.  Some time ago, several customers at Advancing Eco Agriculture asked me to describe how we  can reduce nitrogen and phosphorus requirements and reduce water pollution.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:15):**  I presented a webinar to describe how we manage nitrogen and phosphorus.  You can find the webinar on YouTube by searching for nitrogen and phosphorus management and  I wanted to share it with you here as well.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:29):**  Good afternoon and thank you very much for joining us on this webinar.  We know that we have major challenges throughout the Midwest and in California as well with  nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and pollution causing challenges with water pollution, algae  
**[0:02:44-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:44):**  bloom in waterways, etc to the point where we're now getting legislation on nutrient  runoff, which is something that has been predicted to happen for quite some time.  The reality is that nitrogen and phosphorus runoff don't need to be happening.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:04):**  We already have the knowledge, we have the information today on how to manage both of  these problems to essentially make them go away completely in a very short timeframe.  So the discussion this evening is going to focus specifically on how do we manage nitrogen?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:21):**  How do we manage phosphorus?  What are the specific things that we can do as growers to eliminate nitrogen and phosphorus  leaving the farm, either through leachate or runoff or whatever the case might be?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:37):**  So one of the foundational premises and the frameworks is the idea that plant nutrients  should be available but not soluble.  This is an idea that was first promoted by Dr. William Albrecht, who was a soil science  
**[0:03:55-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:55):**  professor at the University of Missouri in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.  And he postulated this idea that nutrients can be available in the soil profile, but  bound microbially, such that they are still very readily available for the plant to absorb,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:16):**  but they are not soluble in the soil solution.  And there are a couple of reasons why this idea is extremely powerful.  The first reason is that, of course, when soil begins drying out, if you have nutrients  
**[0:04:31-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:31):**  that are soluble in the soil solution, the challenge with that is the moment the soil  dries out, you no longer have good nutrient availability.  And of course, this is a problem.  
**[0:04:46-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:46):**  The second challenge is when you have nutrients that are soluble in the soil solution and  you have a surplus of water, then of course, those nutrients and those ions can move readily  with the water and either leach out through the soil profile or you can have runoff in  
**[0:05:03-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:03):**  some extreme situations.  So when you have nutrients that are microbially bound, they are available but not soluble,  they do not move with water in the soil profile, which means that you can have nutrients that  
**[0:05:18-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:18):**  are plant available, but you do not have water pollution.  And so I want to talk about how we can create that.  And the reality is that when we apply nitrogen, either in the form of nitrate or ammonium,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:32):**  we want to quickly convert that applied molecular fertilizer as nitrate or ammonium to an amino  acid.  And that process happens through bacterial mineralization.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:46):**  So we need very rapid, very quick bacterial digestion that consumes all of the nitrogen  that was applied and converts it to amino acids.  So how do you do that?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:58):**  To accomplish that, in addition to the nitrogen, the bacteria need a generous supply of soluble  carbon, they need sulfur, and they need molybdenum to accomplish those three things.  They obviously need other nutrients and minerals as well, but these are the three major pieces  
**[0:06:17-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:17):**  that we often find to be limiting factors that prevent the bacterial population from  quickly binding nitrogen and converting it to amino acids.  So the key to binding nitrogen or converting nitrogen to amino acids, we can think about  
**[0:06:36-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:36):**  this in terms of carbon nitrogen ratios and the various mineral ratios, the way that they're  formed in stable amino acids and also in stable humic substances.  So carbon to nitrogen ratio in stable solar organic matter, for example, or in stable  
**[0:06:53-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:53):**  humic substances, compost would be a great example.  Compost is stable when you have a carbon to nitrogen ratio in the neighborhood of 30 to  one.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:04):**  At this point, you have very stable compost and different experts will give you different  numbers.  You have different numbers of carbon to nitrogen ratio in the level of 20 to one, different  
**[0:07:13-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:13):**  laboratories and different agronomists measure carbon differently.  For the sake of this discussion, we're going to be using the number of 30 to one, which  is the kind of the recurring number that I find the most reference to.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:26):**  So when you look at stabilizing nitrogen in the form of amino acids, converting nitrogen  to amino acids, sulfur is required to form a couple of the key amino acids such as cysteine  and methionine that is then used and needed to build complete proteins.  
**[0:07:48-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:48):**  Because of these sulfur bearing amino acids, sulfur to nitrogen ratios in wholly formed  proteins, complete proteins that are present when you have adequate sulfur levels usually  show up in a ratio of 10 to one.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:04):**  One part sulfur can effectively stabilize 10 parts nitrogen in the form of amino acids.  So when you combine these two ratios together and you look at carbon to nitrogen to sulfur,  one part sulfur can hold and stabilize 10 parts nitrogen, which can hold and stabilize  
**[0:08:28-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:28):**  300 parts carbon.  Now there's a couple of key pieces here.  The first is that you don't require 300 parts carbon to hold the 10 parts nitrogen stable.  
**[0:08:43-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:43):**  The secret and the key to holding large carbon reserves in the soil profile, if you want  to build solar organic matter quickly and maintain large amounts of soil organic matter,  accumulate a tremendous amount of carbon by managing these other two nutrients.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:05):**  Nitrogen stabilization, and you could also by extension speak of carbon stabilization  because the reality is you're stabilizing all three of these anions together.  This matrix, if you will, these protein and carbon based compounds will be unstable relative  
**[0:09:25-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:25):**  to the lowest common denominator.  What I mean by that is let's say your soil holds a reserve of 60 pounds of nitrogen and  you apply an additional 60 units of nitrogen.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:41):**  So now your soil profile has a total of 120 units of nitrogen in the top six inches.  I'm just making up a hypothetical example.  So you have 120 units of nitrogen and you have eight pounds of available sulfur.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:57):**  To maintain the 10 to one ratio of nitrogen to sulfur in the soil profile, you are now  missing four pounds of sulfur.  Eight pounds of sulfur, that means you can hold 80 units of nitrogen.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:12):**  Your soil already had 60, you added 60 more.  But those 60 that you applied, you now have a total of 120, 40 pounds of that nitrogen,  40 out of the 60 that you applied is going to remain soluble as nitrate or as ammonium.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:30):**  Nitrate of course is the most leachable.  So those 40 units of nitrogen can move through the soil very quickly and very easily because  you don't have enough sulfur to hold them stable.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:42):**  There's a very simple remedy for this.  If we just simply apply sulfur at the same time that we apply nitrogen, we now give the  bacteria in the soil profile resources that they need and to convert all that soluble  
**[0:10:57-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:57):**  nitrogen into the amino acid form and we don't get nitrate leaching.  Of course, when we speak to the lowest common denominator, it is also possible that the  lowest common denominator can be available carbon, particularly in sandy soil.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:13):**  So when we have soils that are low in organic matter, have very large particle size, adequate  carbon to bind the nitrogen can be a challenge, particularly when we don't have a green growing  crop.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:29):**  So when you have a crop that is green and has a substantial amount of vegetative biomass,  if it's a healthy crop, it should be contributing a substantial amount of carbon to the root  system and moving out into the rhizosphere as root exudates.  
**[0:11:46-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:46):**  If that is happening properly as it should be, then generally you are supplying a substantial  amount of carbon from living root biomass and from root exudates.  Where this would not be the case is if you have very small seedlings that are scattered  
**[0:12:01-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:01):**  out, you don't have substantial biomass on a per acre scale or per square foot scale.  So in those conditions, in those situations, we may need to actually add some carbon, both  soluble carbon and very concentrated carbon to help bind the nitrogen and to give the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:23):**  bacteria the resources that they need.  There are a number of combinations that we can add to our nitrogen applications that  are relatively inexpensive that make rapid changes in nitrogen stability.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:35):**  I'm not even going to speak of some of the newer technologies that are emerging such  as polymer coatings for polymer coated urea, nitrification inhibiting products can make  substantial differences as well.  
**[0:12:49-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:49):**  I'm not even going to speak to those, although those are very worthwhile researching, understanding  and applying because many of them do work very well in the right situations.  So the pieces that I'm referring to here are relatively low tech and they're very effective.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:05):**  The first, combining the nitrogen application with sulfur.  So adding ammonium thiosulfate, for example, ammonium thiosulfate is a 12-0-0-26, 26% in  sulfur.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:19):**  And the goal is to add thiosol to a liquid nitrogen application in such a ratio that  we have 10% of nitrogen as sulfur so that we achieve that 10 to one nitrogen ratio.  This is very inexpensive to apply and makes a difference almost immediately.  
**[0:13:41-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:41):**  The second piece is adding stable humic substances such as humicarb, a very concentrated and  very stable carbon source, which has a very large complexing capacity and holding capacity  that is referred to as AEC, anion exchange capacity, which I'll speak to a bit later  
**[0:14:03-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:03):**  when we talk about phosphorus.  So humicarb has the capacity to bind and hold anions similar to what a clay colloid has  the capacity to hold cations.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:20):**  They contain a number of positive charges which allow them to hold negatively charged  ions such as nitrate.  This is very different from adding carbon in the form of sugar or molasses, for example.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:35):**  That can also be beneficial, but it has a completely different purpose.  So we typically recommend adding humicarb at 10% of the nitrogen percentage.  For example, if you have liquid 32 UAN 3200, 10% of that nitrogen number would be 3%.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:59):**  So to that total solution, we would add 3% humicarb.  And we found that that is adequate to stabilize and hold almost all of the nitrogen in that  solution and prevent it from flushing and moving quickly with the water profile.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:17):**  I specifically mentioned humicarb.  We have not found this same effect to be true for other humic acids and other humic substances  to the same degree.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:29):**  I believe this is true because the humicarb being manufactured and still retaining the  human fraction, not being chemically extracted humic acid.  When you have humic acid that is extracted with potassium hydroxide or other alkali solutions,  
**[0:15:48-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:48):**  there is still some of the anion exchange capacity present.  You still have the capacity to hold nitrate, but to a greatly reduced degree.  Of course, there's many different sources, but many of the alkali extractions have the  
**[0:16:01-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:01):**  capacity to hold about 10 to 15% of the nitrogen that humicarb does, which means that you need  to apply seven to 10 times more in order to have the same effect.  The third piece that you can add is rebound molybdenum at one pint per acre.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:20):**  The purpose for adding molybdenum is that it is the enzyme cofactor for the nitrate  reductase enzyme, which is needed by the bacteria in the rhizosphere to convert nitrate to amino  acids.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:35):**  A small amount makes a very rapid difference very quickly.  The fourth piece is adding Rejuvenate.  Here we now have another carbon source.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:47):**  Rejuvenate contains a substantial amount of molasses in addition to a whole range of other  enzyme cofactors and microbial biostimulants.  Because of the molasses component, it's a very strong bacterial biostimulant, which  
**[0:16:59-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:59):**  is very valuable in this situation because bacteria do not thrive in an environment with  concentrated nitrogen applications.  If you apply a band of liquid 28 or 32 or a CAN 17 or whatever the case might be, it's  
**[0:17:16-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:16):**  a strong oxidizer and it really suppresses the bacterial population right in the band  of that zone.  You are suppressing the bacteria that you want to convert the nitrogen application into  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:31):**  amino acids.  This is a problem.  This is why Rejuvenate is so valuable.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:36):**  Humicarb helps a lot to buffer out that effect and it already begins having an impact on  the bacterial population.  The Rejuvenate is a strong bacterial biostimulant that really invigorates that bacterial population  
**[0:17:49-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:49):**  and allows it to recover very, very quickly and really begin binding up and tying up the  nitrogen and preventing it from moving through the soil.  The other key piece, of course, in addition to being a biostimulant is that it contains  
**[0:18:02-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:02):**  some of that liquid carbon fraction that is needed where it can actually supply a carbohydrate  source to begin balancing out some of the nitrogen that is in the profile.  Now it's not enough.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:17):**  It's not enough in and of itself.  If you wanted to supply all of the sugars that were needed, all the carbohydrates that  were needed to bind all of that nitrogen and convert it to amino acids, you'd be looking  
**[0:18:32-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:32):**  at applying a fairly substantial quantity of sugar.  It would be incredibly powerful if you had the capacity to do that.  We've worked with a couple of small-scale fruit and vegetable growers who conducted  
**[0:18:42-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:42):**  experiments and you get some really incredible soil and plant responses.  If you're able to add larger quantities of carbohydrates with your nitrogen application,  it makes a really big difference.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:00):**  Five percent of the nitrogen solution is not enough, but it's enough to make a really,  really big difference to the bacterial population and really get them started very aggressively.  If you look at the summary, four pieces, ammonium thiosulfate, humacarb, molybdenum, and Rejuvenate.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:19):**  I know from a lot of field experience that when you combine these four pieces, I can  say with complete confidence that you can apply 100 units of nitrogen per acre or 150  units of nitrogen per acre, even in extreme examples, which I do not recommend.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:37):**  I would strongly prefer to put on smaller doses more frequently rather than really aggressive  and intense applications all at one shot.  But I know from experience that when we combine these treatments and add them to our liquid  
**[0:19:53-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:53):**  nitrogen applications, we can bind all of that nitrogen, can prevent it from leaching  and still maintain it in a very plant-available form.  In other words, it's available, but not soluble.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:06):**  And this is very powerful and very important.  There is a relatively straightforward trade-off between the cost of this application and nitrogen  efficiency.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:17):**  Many of the growers that we have worked with add this to their nitrogen application, and  it's very safe on almost all soils and almost all conditions to reduce nitrogen applications  by 30% when you add this, because you're not going to lose any of it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:34):**  It's going to stay there.  And you can add these materials, the humacarb, Rejuvenate, and the molybdenum to the solution.  You should be adding the ammonium thiosulfate anyway.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:44):**  These are the three materials you can add to the solution.  And depending on where commercial nitrogen costs are, of course, in the form that you're  deploying, you might be spending a few dollars more per acre, but the crop response and the  
**[0:20:57-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:57):**  soil response is really substantial.  It's absolutely worth it.  So we're going to switch gears and speak about phosphorus for a little bit.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:09):**  Phosphorus is, of phosphorus and nitrogen, phosphorus is perhaps the biggest challenge  from a water pollution perspective in terms of the impact that it has on the health of  water reservoirs and rivers and streams and lakes and oceans, et cetera.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:26):**  The thing that we have to remember is phosphorus is quite insoluble in natural systems, both  in soil and in water.  And as a result, a very small amount of phosphorus in the water can have a huge impact.  
**[0:21:45-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:45):**  If I'm not mistaken, I believe that the phosphorus levels required to produce a substantial algae  bloom are between 10 and 35 parts per billion with B. So we're looking at very, very small  phosphorus concentrations in the water profile that can make a really big difference in water  
**[0:22:09-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:09):**  quality.  So it leaves as soluble phosphorus shortly after application.  That shortly depends on the form that it was applied in, the quantity that it was applied  
**[0:22:22-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:22):**  in, and the soil type.  That can be a few days to a few weeks.  It can leave while it is still in a soluble form.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:31):**  If you get a lot of rainfall, it can leave from runoff or from leachate through the soil  profile in a relatively straightforward fashion.  The second way that phosphorus leaves soil is with soil particles.  
**[0:22:46-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:46):**  And it's unfortunate if we're losing phosphorus from the soil profile by losing soil particles.  But I believe, and I'll explain why I believe this, I believe that in fact a great deal  of phosphorus pollution happens when soil particles leave the farm.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:04):**  I believe that is true because phosphorus does not stay soluble in the soil for very  long.  Even when it is applied in the soluble form, in a matter of weeks, the great majority of  
**[0:23:16-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:16):**  it is complexed because it doesn't remain soluble in natural systems very readily.  Phosphorus exists in the soil profile in four different buckets, if you will.  I want to speak briefly about each of these and describe how they work and what's happening  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:36):**  and what's going on.  First, you have these four different buckets.  You have orthophosphates, which is the soluble form of phosphorus that plant roots absorb.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:44):**  You have that which is microbially complex.  In other words, it's bound up in bacterial and fungal bodies in the soil profile.  You have that which is adsorbed to soil particles or to humic substances.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:57):**  You have that which is existing in the mineral form or in precipitated form from prior soluble  phosphorus applications.  Let's look at each of these.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:09):**  I want to explain what's happening with each of these a little bit.  The first category, orthophosphates.  Plants primarily absorb phosphorus in the orthophosphate form.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:19):**  They can also absorb some levels of polyphosphates.  But orthophosphates are the preferred, the most efficient, the most effective.  And generally, there are only very small amounts of orthophosphates in a natural soil environment  
**[0:24:36-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:36):**  at any given moment.  Typically, we're looking at one pound per acre or even less.  You can even have only a half a pound per acre of soluble orthophosphate.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:47):**  However, I'm speaking of a natural soil environment where you have not applied soluble phosphorus  fertilizers.  That's a very small amount.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:55):**  The key is that that small amount can be replenished from the other reserves on a continual basis  and is replenished continually in a natural system.  When a synthetic phosphorus fertilizer is applied, let's say it's a dry granular map  
**[0:25:14-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:14):**  or DAP or it can be a liquid orthophosphate or a polyphosphate like 10-34-0.  When that phosphorus is applied, it moves into these four other containers that are  present in the soil profile.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:31):**  A large amount of it is going to quickly precipitate out and join the mineral fraction.  In other words, it's going to become complexed and locked up and not available.  Some of it can be adsorbed onto slow particles very quickly.  
**[0:25:47-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:47):**  In fact, the majority of applied phosphorus will go to the adsorbed bucket or to the precipitate  bucket in a matter of as little as three to six weeks after application.  In the meantime, in that three to six-week period, substantial amounts of it are converted  
**[0:26:04-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:04):**  to the orthophosphate form and it also has a very damaging effect to the microbial population.  It shuts down the microbial population in the rhizosphere that has the capacity to solubilize  phosphorus later in the growing season.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:23):**  This is a really big deal and very important.  I want to describe this in a little bit.  In this microbially complexed category, we know very little about what happens with microbial  
**[0:26:37-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:37):**  interactions in the rhizosphere.  But the few pieces that we think we understand are that one, most of the crops that we're  producing with a few exceptions are colonized by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:55):**  One of the things that mycorrhizal fungi are known for is solubilizing phosphorus.  More recently, we've identified that there is actually a third symbiotic group.  It's not just that plants have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, but in  
**[0:27:12-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:12):**  fact, plants have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which have a symbiotic  relationship with phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  The three of these work together, so plants actually are giving photosynthesis and sugars  
**[0:27:27-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:27):**  to the mycorrhizal fungi, and the mycorrhizal fungi are transferring some of those root  exudates and those sugars to the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  So you have this three-level symbiotic relationship.  
**[0:27:41-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:41):**  The phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, they're very effective at producing the phosphatase  enzyme and the phytase enzyme and other enzymes, which can fracture the phosphorus-containing  minerals such as appetite and tricalcium phosphate, et cetera, that exist in the soil mineral  
**[0:28:02-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:02):**  profile.  So they can actually extract and release locked up, tied up phosphorus in the soil profile.  This mineralization process occurs most rapidly at soil temperatures in the neighborhood of  
**[0:28:15-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:15):**  about 65 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  The reason this is worth describing a little bit is because whenever we apply a soluble  phosphorus fertilizer, it suppresses both mycorrhizal fungi and the phosphorus-solubilizing  
**[0:28:35-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:35):**  bacteria.  This is a big problem.  The reason it suppresses mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, we think  
**[0:28:45-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:45):**  we're not entirely certain, but we believe that there is an indirect effect.  The plants will only release sugars out through the root system and signal mycorrhizal fungi  and these bacteria.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:01):**  Plants have the capacity to signal microorganisms for exactly what they need.  If they need phosphorus, they provide a flush of sugars to mycorrhizae and to bacteria,  and they also signal them with specific compounds to say, we need more phosphorus.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:23):**  So the mycorrhizal fungi and the bacteria begin releasing large amounts of phosphorus  and feeding it back to the plant.  That's where we have this symbiotic mutually beneficial relationship happening.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:34):**  But now, when you have an environment in the root zone, in the rhizosphere, where you have  an abundance of soluble phosphorus, the plant roots begin absorbing that very quickly, and  the plant has an adequate or a generous supply of phosphorus.  
**[0:29:50-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:50):**  So it will not transmit the signal, the signaling compounds or the sugars to the mycorrhizae  and to the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  So those populations never develop.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:02):**  Then, three weeks to six weeks later, once the applied phosphorus fertilizer has been  precipitated or locked up in the soil profile, all of a sudden, the plant now has a functional  phosphorus deficiency.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:20):**  There's no longer phosphorus present in the soil profile, and you also no longer have  mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  So you've shot yourself in the foot.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:33):**  You have damaged the microbial population in the short term, and it's going to have  long-term effects where you will have limited phosphorus supply later in the growing season,  right at the period when the plant needs them the most for reproduction and the fruit fill.  
**[0:30:51-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:51):**  This is why this is so much of a challenge and so much of a problem.  All right, let's speak about the next category, the next bucket.  The next category, adsorbed phosphorus.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:05):**  Everyone understands and talks about a soil's CEC, cation exchange capacity.  We understand that sand and silt and clay particles in the soil profile all have some  capacity to hold cations, positively charged elements.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:29):**  What is much less well understood and not frequently described is that many soils also  have what is termed an anion exchange capacity, or AEC instead of CEC.  This is particularly true for soils that have clay particles, and also stable humic substances  
**[0:31:51-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:51):**  and organic matter have extremely high anion exchange capacity.  When soils have a high clay content or they have large proportion of very small soil particles,  they can adsorb phosphorus extremely rapidly in extremely large quantities.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:09):**  I referenced that soils can contain as much as 500 pounds per acre of adsorbed phosphorus.  Of course, it's difficult to make generalizations because you have such a broad range of soil  types, but in fact, there are some soil types where you have higher clay content, where  
**[0:32:26-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:26):**  you can have as much as 1500 to 1800 pounds of adsorbed phosphorus in the soil profile.  And I'm just referring to the top six inches.  So some soils have tremendous phosphorus holding capacity.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:40):**  And by the way, this is phosphorus that will never show up on most soil analysis.  It won't show up on Bray or a Melek-3 analysis or even Olson or most of the commonly used  soil analysis.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:52):**  So the key is that roots, plant root systems have very limited access to adsorb phosphorus.  It's not particularly soluble.  It doesn't move in soil solution very readily.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:04):**  And it's mostly released by microbial mineralization.  When the orthophosphates become very limited, less than a pound per acre, then a small amount  of the adsorbed phosphorus begins being released and shifts from adsorbed phosphorus to the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:19):**  orthophosphate.  But it happens very slowly.  And it happens through the microbial mineralization process for the most part.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:28):**  Also worth mentioning, applied phosphorus can be bound and can be adsorbed very quickly.  The fourth category is mineral phosphorus or precipitated phosphorus in the soil profile.  So phosphorus precipitates, this would be tricalcium phosphate, apatite, hydroxyapatite.  
**[0:33:50-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:50):**  There's a broad different array of minerals that are formed.  So most many soils, and again, making some very broad generalizations here because there's  many different soil types all across the continent.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:05):**  But there are many, many loam soils, particularly clay loam soils, often will contain as much  as 9,000 pounds per acre of phosphorus in the top six inches in the mineral form.  When we add soluble phosphorus as a liquid or dry phosphorus application, within a matter  
**[0:34:26-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:26):**  of a few weeks, they tend to move to either adsorbed phosphorus or to mineral precipitates.  So precipitation reactions, they can happen very quickly, particularly in acidic or alkaline  soils.  
**[0:34:41-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:41):**  So in acidic soils, phosphorus reacts very quickly with iron or aluminum and manganese.  The reason it is attracted to those three in particular is because phosphorus has a  triple negative charge and iron and aluminum and some isotopes of manganese have a triple  
**[0:35:00-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:00):**  positive charge.  And this is why there are such low levels of soluble phosphorus in natural ecosystems  because it becomes complexed and tied up very, very quickly.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:12):**  In alkaline soils, phosphorus tends to react with calcium and form tri calcium phosphate,  where you have three calciums that have a double positive for a total of six bonded  with two phosphorus that have a triple positive for a total of six as well.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:30):**  So the important part, however, is that root systems cannot absorb precipitated phosphorus  or mineral phosphorus in the soil profile.  It is locked up in mineral reserves.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:42):**  It is not soluble and not available.  And in fact, there is some research which indicates that the phosphorus which has been  applied to the soil and then precipitates out may in fact be more difficult for microbes  
**[0:35:59-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:59):**  and bacteria to release than the native mineral phosphorus that is already existing in the  soil profile, which is something that I'm certainly looking forward to learning much  more about.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:11):**  We have huge quantities available and we have greater than 9,000 pounds in the top six inches.  That's more than we can harvest with hundreds of years of crops, not even to speak of all  of the remaining phosphorus in the soil profile below that.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:26):**  And if we want to tap into that, we can tap into that, but we need aggressive bacterial  and fungal digestive processes happening in order for that to happen.  So this is the challenge that we often see happening in agriculture.  
**[0:36:44-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:44):**  Growers apply substantial quantities of soluble phosphorus where they are actually then unable  to tap into the tremendous phosphorus reserves that are already in the soil profile.  In essence, as long as you continue to suppress that fungal and bacterial system, you will  
**[0:37:06-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:06):**  never be able to tap into the tremendous reserves of phosphorus that are already existing, that  are already out there.  So the ultimate in the soil health and soil performance is when we rearrange those four  
**[0:37:18-0:37:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:18):**  buckets a little bit and now we look at how we can tap into the adsorbed and the mineral  and precipitate phosphorus.  In an optimal environment, the adsorbed and the mineral phosphorus is being digested and  
**[0:37:34-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:34):**  processed by bacteria and fungi and then is being converted and solubilized and released  in the orthophosphate form.  So this is an ecosystem where there is no need for synthetic phosphorus applications  
**[0:37:51-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:51):**  of any kind.  Now you may be thinking that sounds quite idealistic and utopian, that's not realistic  and that's not practical, but in reality, a number of farms are implementing this today  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:04):**  very successfully on a very large scale.  This is not idealistic.  This is not a pipe dream.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:11):**  We have the knowledge and the information today to develop soil ecosystems where we  do not need to apply any soluble synthetic phosphorus and we can achieve continually  increasing yields and continually increasing crop quality.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:30):**  There are farms that are doing this successfully and have been doing it successfully for over  a decade.  And of course, to achieve this, we really need to take an ecosystems approach.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:39):**  So the growers who are doing this successfully are using crop rotations, they're using cover  crops, they're doing a number of things well to maintain the vigorous microbial population  that is required to achieve this level of performance.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:55):**  But it is possible.  In situations where we're not able to have crop rotations and cover crops, if we're growing  salad greens or strawberries on a continual basis, that is going to be a cropping system  
**[0:39:09-0:39:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:09):**  where we may need to continue applying small amounts of phosphorus.  This is the ideal that we want to strive for, but we're not there yet.  We're still back here.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:20):**  So how do we get to more closely approximating this to a partially integrated ecosystem that  is much more vibrant and much more healthy?  Here are a couple of the keys.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:32):**  So when we begin working with growers to help them through a transition, there are a couple  of pieces that we begin looking at right away.  We want to reduce the quantity of applied phosphorus fertilizers per application.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:46):**  So rather than putting on large doses in one shot, we would much rather spoon feed it over  an extended period of time.  This is just common sense.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:54):**  I'm sure that all of you already know this and most of you are already doing it.  The second piece is to buffer and stabilize that applied phosphorus fertilizer so that  it is available but not soluble.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:10):**  And so that we can increase crop utilization from 15% up to 60 plus percent.  This is something that I didn't speak about, but there is in fact quite a bit of research  which indicates that when soluble phosphorus is applied to the soil profile, as much as  
**[0:40:27-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:27):**  90% of it is either adsorbed or precipitated in between 20 and 40 days.  Say what?  You think about that for a moment.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:39):**  90% of applied soluble phosphorus is precipitated out or adsorbed and is no longer plant available  between 20 and 40 days.  This is a very general statement and in some soil environments, some cropping systems,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:58):**  I'm sure are doing better than that.  You might have only 80% or only 70% being complexed in a matter of 60 or 70 days.  Perhaps it's happening slower.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:09):**  Perhaps you're losing less.  But even fertilizer manufacturers in their own research indicate that at best 30% of  the phosphorus that is applied is absorbed by the crop.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:23):**  So this is an incredibly inefficient and incredibly wasteful form of fertilization.  When you stop to think about it, there's no common sense at all.  There is a much better way and we know how to do that.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:36):**  So the third piece, we can add the phosphorus-solubilizing microbes, the mycorrhizal fungi, the phosphorus-solubilizing  bacteria and biostimulants, which really stimulate those.  So we're applying a little bit less fertilizer.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:53):**  And because we're applying less fertilizer, that means we are now having a much less damaging  effect on the soil biology.  And we are counteracting that very limited damaging effect with all the biostimulants  
**[0:42:09-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:09):**  that we're adding.  And so as a result, we get this flush of available phosphorus that is in the microbially complex  form.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:20):**  I've suggested that you can have up to 50 pounds per acre of phosphorus in the microbially  complex form.  I know actually for certain that that is a conservative number.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:30):**  And again, this varies so widely based on organic matter levels and bacterial and fungal  populations.  But this is essentially the phosphorus that is contained within the fungal and bacterial  
**[0:42:41-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:41):**  biomass.  The moment the plant sends the signal that it needs phosphorus, it's instantly there.  It is instantly there.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:53):**  So you will never have a phosphorus-deficient crop as long as you have a generous supply  of microbially complexed phosphorus.  That's really the form that you want it to be in.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:05):**  Okay, how do you do this?  How do you get there?  There's essentially a couple of key pieces.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:12):**  Over to what I spoke of regarding nitrogen management, humic substances are unique in  that unlike soil particles, they have a very high anion exchange capacity and they can  complex anions.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:31):**  So in much the same way that humicarb can complex and stabilize nitrate, it can also  complex and stabilize phosphate.  When you add humicarb to a phosphorus fertilizer, it is going to buffer that fertilizer so that  
**[0:43:49-0:44:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:49):**  it doesn't have the negative effect on soil biology.  And it's also going to stabilize it so that it doesn't become adsorb and it doesn't precipitate  out nearly as quickly.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:00):**  So it's going to hold that phosphorus in the phosphorus form that it was applied in for  a much longer period of time.  That of course is going to give you much better crop performance and longer period of absorption.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:11):**  When you start to think about it, the most efficient numbers are 30%.  The average efficiency is generally assumed to be in the neighborhood of 5 to 15%.  So let's just say 10% for the sake of discussion.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:24):**  That means if you apply fertilizer, let's say MAP 1152-0 at 100 pounds per acre, you're  applying 52 units of phosphorus.  If only 10% of that is being plant absorbed, it's 5 pounds of phosphorus.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:40):**  Let's be very generous.  Let's go with a 30% number.  30% of applied phosphorus is still only 15 pounds per acre.  
**[0:44:47-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:47):**  Adding humic substances to phosphorus fertilizers increases plant utilization by 30%.  So right there, there's one piece that can give you a 30% increase in the efficiency  of your phosphorus fertilizer applications.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:00):**  And of course, when you stabilize it, it also means it's now not going to be water soluble  and it's not going to leach and cause water pollution effects.  The second piece is using BioCoat Gold.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:14):**  So BioCoat Gold is a combination of the mycorrhizal fungi and the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria  that I mentioned that we use as a root treatment or as a seed treatment and combine this with  a rejuvenated application to get a strong biostimulant effect to establish these microbes  
**[0:45:35-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:35):**  and give them a very strong and a very aggressive start.  Combining these microbial inoculants and biostimulants, stabilizing phosphorus applications  with stable humic substances, reducing the application quantity and spreading them out  
**[0:45:51-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:51):**  over a period of time, you can greatly reduce the quantity of phosphorus that you need to  apply to produce a crop to the point where if you are able to incorporate cover crops  and crop rotations, there's no question and no doubt in my mind that you can get to the  
**[0:46:08-0:46:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:08):**  point where you can eliminate the need for any phosphorus application and simply tap  into all the phosphorus that you have accumulated from historical phosphorus applications, as  well as from a native geological profile.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:22):**  I didn't state this explicitly, although it was somewhat implied in the approach that  I described.  To manage phosphorus well, you really need to take an ecosystem approach.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:35):**  You have to manage the entire ecosystem.  Well, it's not quite as straightforward as managing nitrate because there is a longer  term response from the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:46:49-0:47:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:49):**  The response is a little bit slower, a little bit more delayed than it is with converting  nitrates to amino acids.  However, one of the pieces that I didn't speak to was how do you prevent soil particles from  
**[0:47:02-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:02):**  moving?  It's one thing to prevent or to reduce the soluble phosphorus levels, but how do you  reduce soil, particularly clay particles, very small soil particles, which are the easiest  
**[0:47:14-0:47:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:14):**  to move, of course, taking phosphorus with them.  However, we're talking about 10 to 35 parts per billion of phosphorus in a water reservoir  being able to produce a tremendous algae bloom, practically nothing.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:30):**  A very small amount of clay in the water column from erosion can contain that quantity of  phosphorus.  It doesn't take very much.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:38):**  This, of course, could be an entire other conversation, but the headline is simply that  we need to bind these small clay particles and form larger, more stable soil aggregates  and larger crumb structure, stable crumb structure within the soil profile, which, oh, by the  
**[0:47:58-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:58):**  way, is something that mycorrhizal fungi does extremely well producing this peptide, this  compound called glomalin, which is essentially soil glue, which takes all these small particles  and bonds them together into much larger, more stable soil aggregates.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:18):**  When you inoculate soils with mycorrhizal fungi and you maintain strong populations  of mycorrhizal fungi, not only do you have the effect of solubilizing and releasing phosphorus  for the plant, but you also have the effect of stabilizing the crumb structure within  
**[0:48:33-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:33):**  the soil profile and reducing the free clay particles that can move off the soil with  erosion.  Managing erosion is a whole other topic in and of itself, and the need to keep the soil  
**[0:48:51-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:51):**  covered with a living cover crop or a mulch or whatever the case might be.  You can greatly reduce erosion and greatly reduce the movement of these small clay particles  where you have this cloudy, milky water by maintaining active mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:11):**  So thank you very much for attending.  I hope that you found it useful.  And if you have any feedback or any topics that you would love for me to speak about  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:20):**  in the future, I would love very much to hear from you.  Thanks everyone.  Bye.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:24):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  a leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative  
**[0:49:39-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:39):**  ways to grow crops.  We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy  crops, we must first think different about agriculture, about empowering life instead  
**[0:49:50-0:50:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:50):**  of suppressing life, about regeneration versus degeneration.  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products that help growers produce higher quality yield  with less risk of crop failure.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:50:00):**  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.  Thanks for listening.

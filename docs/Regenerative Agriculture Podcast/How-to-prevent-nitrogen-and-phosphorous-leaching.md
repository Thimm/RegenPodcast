### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 12:33:46)
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf, hosting this podcast.  
**[0:00:03-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:03):**  I am passionate about developing regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:09):**  produce crops that are completely resistant to diseases and insects, and produce fruit  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:13):**  of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate conversation about growing  
**[0:00:18-0:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:18):**  food as medicine.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:19):**  I've discovered that there are many people with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:24):**  about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative agriculture systems.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:29):**  However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered, it's found all over the place.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:34):**  Some of it has been published in peer reviewed publications, but there are many incredible  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:39):**  stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published and that hasn't been shared  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:43):**  with many people.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:44):**  I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to bring this knowledge together in a more  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:51):**  coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and growing systems that growers can easily  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:57):**  put into practice.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:00:58):**  It's my personal mission to have these regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:03):**  and become the mainstream, the status quo against which all other growing systems are  
**[0:01:09-0:01:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:09):**  compared.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:10):**  To help achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge that we have learned in the  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:14):**  last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:21):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:26):**  can be applied anywhere and when they are applied properly, they will always increase  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:01:32):**  farm profitability and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:01):**  Hi friends.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:02):**  This podcast is a little bit different.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:05):**  Some time ago, several customers at Advancing Eco Agriculture asked me to describe how we  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:10):**  can reduce nitrogen and phosphorus requirements and reduce water pollution.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:15):**  I presented a webinar to describe how we manage nitrogen and phosphorus.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:20):**  You can find the webinar on YouTube by searching for nitrogen and phosphorus management and  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:27):**  I wanted to share it with you here as well.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:29):**  Good afternoon and thank you very much for joining us on this webinar.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:33):**  We know that we have major challenges throughout the Midwest and in California as well with  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:38):**  nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and pollution causing challenges with water pollution, algae  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:44):**  bloom in waterways, etc to the point where we're now getting legislation on nutrient  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:51):**  runoff, which is something that has been predicted to happen for quite some time.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:02:56):**  The reality is that nitrogen and phosphorus runoff don't need to be happening.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:04):**  We already have the knowledge, we have the information today on how to manage both of  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:08):**  these problems to essentially make them go away completely in a very short timeframe.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:15):**  So the discussion this evening is going to focus specifically on how do we manage nitrogen?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:21):**  How do we manage phosphorus?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:23):**  What are the specific things that we can do as growers to eliminate nitrogen and phosphorus  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:32):**  leaving the farm, either through leachate or runoff or whatever the case might be?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:37):**  So one of the foundational premises and the frameworks is the idea that plant nutrients  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:45):**  should be available but not soluble.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:48):**  This is an idea that was first promoted by Dr. William Albrecht, who was a soil science  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:03:55):**  professor at the University of Missouri in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:00):**  And he postulated this idea that nutrients can be available in the soil profile, but  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:08):**  bound microbially, such that they are still very readily available for the plant to absorb,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:16):**  but they are not soluble in the soil solution.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:20):**  And there are a couple of reasons why this idea is extremely powerful.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:24):**  The first reason is that, of course, when soil begins drying out, if you have nutrients  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:31):**  that are soluble in the soil solution, the challenge with that is the moment the soil  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:38):**  dries out, you no longer have good nutrient availability.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:43):**  And of course, this is a problem.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:46):**  The second challenge is when you have nutrients that are soluble in the soil solution and  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:52):**  you have a surplus of water, then of course, those nutrients and those ions can move readily  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:04:58):**  with the water and either leach out through the soil profile or you can have runoff in  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:03):**  some extreme situations.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:06):**  So when you have nutrients that are microbially bound, they are available but not soluble,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:12):**  they do not move with water in the soil profile, which means that you can have nutrients that  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:18):**  are plant available, but you do not have water pollution.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:22):**  And so I want to talk about how we can create that.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:25):**  And the reality is that when we apply nitrogen, either in the form of nitrate or ammonium,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:32):**  we want to quickly convert that applied molecular fertilizer as nitrate or ammonium to an amino  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:41):**  acid.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:43):**  And that process happens through bacterial mineralization.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:46):**  So we need very rapid, very quick bacterial digestion that consumes all of the nitrogen  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:53):**  that was applied and converts it to amino acids.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:56):**  So how do you do that?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:05:58):**  To accomplish that, in addition to the nitrogen, the bacteria need a generous supply of soluble  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:06):**  carbon, they need sulfur, and they need molybdenum to accomplish those three things.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:12):**  They obviously need other nutrients and minerals as well, but these are the three major pieces  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:17):**  that we often find to be limiting factors that prevent the bacterial population from  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:24):**  quickly binding nitrogen and converting it to amino acids.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:29):**  So the key to binding nitrogen or converting nitrogen to amino acids, we can think about  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:36):**  this in terms of carbon nitrogen ratios and the various mineral ratios, the way that they're  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:41):**  formed in stable amino acids and also in stable humic substances.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:45):**  So carbon to nitrogen ratio in stable solar organic matter, for example, or in stable  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:53):**  humic substances, compost would be a great example.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:06:57):**  Compost is stable when you have a carbon to nitrogen ratio in the neighborhood of 30 to  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:03):**  one.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:04):**  At this point, you have very stable compost and different experts will give you different  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:08):**  numbers.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:09):**  You have different numbers of carbon to nitrogen ratio in the level of 20 to one, different  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:13):**  laboratories and different agronomists measure carbon differently.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:17):**  For the sake of this discussion, we're going to be using the number of 30 to one, which  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:21):**  is the kind of the recurring number that I find the most reference to.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:26):**  So when you look at stabilizing nitrogen in the form of amino acids, converting nitrogen  
**[0:07:33-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:33):**  to amino acids, sulfur is required to form a couple of the key amino acids such as cysteine  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:42):**  and methionine that is then used and needed to build complete proteins.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:48):**  Because of these sulfur bearing amino acids, sulfur to nitrogen ratios in wholly formed  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:07:56):**  proteins, complete proteins that are present when you have adequate sulfur levels usually  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:01):**  show up in a ratio of 10 to one.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:04):**  One part sulfur can effectively stabilize 10 parts nitrogen in the form of amino acids.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:13):**  So when you combine these two ratios together and you look at carbon to nitrogen to sulfur,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:21):**  one part sulfur can hold and stabilize 10 parts nitrogen, which can hold and stabilize  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:28):**  300 parts carbon.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:30):**  Now there's a couple of key pieces here.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:33):**  The first is that you don't require 300 parts carbon to hold the 10 parts nitrogen stable.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:43):**  The secret and the key to holding large carbon reserves in the soil profile, if you want  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:51):**  to build solar organic matter quickly and maintain large amounts of soil organic matter,  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:08:57):**  accumulate a tremendous amount of carbon by managing these other two nutrients.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:05):**  Nitrogen stabilization, and you could also by extension speak of carbon stabilization  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:10):**  because the reality is you're stabilizing all three of these anions together.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:14):**  This matrix, if you will, these protein and carbon based compounds will be unstable relative  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:25):**  to the lowest common denominator.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:28):**  What I mean by that is let's say your soil holds a reserve of 60 pounds of nitrogen and  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:37):**  you apply an additional 60 units of nitrogen.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:41):**  So now your soil profile has a total of 120 units of nitrogen in the top six inches.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:46):**  I'm just making up a hypothetical example.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:49):**  So you have 120 units of nitrogen and you have eight pounds of available sulfur.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:09:57):**  To maintain the 10 to one ratio of nitrogen to sulfur in the soil profile, you are now  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:04):**  missing four pounds of sulfur.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:08):**  Eight pounds of sulfur, that means you can hold 80 units of nitrogen.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:12):**  Your soil already had 60, you added 60 more.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:16):**  But those 60 that you applied, you now have a total of 120, 40 pounds of that nitrogen,  
**[0:10:22-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:22):**  40 out of the 60 that you applied is going to remain soluble as nitrate or as ammonium.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:30):**  Nitrate of course is the most leachable.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:32):**  So those 40 units of nitrogen can move through the soil very quickly and very easily because  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:37):**  you don't have enough sulfur to hold them stable.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:42):**  There's a very simple remedy for this.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:44):**  If we just simply apply sulfur at the same time that we apply nitrogen, we now give the  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:50):**  bacteria in the soil profile resources that they need and to convert all that soluble  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:10:57):**  nitrogen into the amino acid form and we don't get nitrate leaching.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:02):**  Of course, when we speak to the lowest common denominator, it is also possible that the  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:08):**  lowest common denominator can be available carbon, particularly in sandy soil.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:13):**  So when we have soils that are low in organic matter, have very large particle size, adequate  
**[0:11:19-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:19):**  carbon to bind the nitrogen can be a challenge, particularly when we don't have a green growing  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:28):**  crop.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:29):**  So when you have a crop that is green and has a substantial amount of vegetative biomass,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:35):**  if it's a healthy crop, it should be contributing a substantial amount of carbon to the root  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:41):**  system and moving out into the rhizosphere as root exudates.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:46):**  If that is happening properly as it should be, then generally you are supplying a substantial  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:52):**  amount of carbon from living root biomass and from root exudates.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:11:57):**  Where this would not be the case is if you have very small seedlings that are scattered  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:01):**  out, you don't have substantial biomass on a per acre scale or per square foot scale.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:07):**  So in those conditions, in those situations, we may need to actually add some carbon, both  
**[0:12:15-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:15):**  soluble carbon and very concentrated carbon to help bind the nitrogen and to give the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:23):**  bacteria the resources that they need.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:25):**  There are a number of combinations that we can add to our nitrogen applications that  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:29):**  are relatively inexpensive that make rapid changes in nitrogen stability.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:35):**  I'm not even going to speak of some of the newer technologies that are emerging such  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:40):**  as polymer coatings for polymer coated urea, nitrification inhibiting products can make  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:46):**  substantial differences as well.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:49):**  I'm not even going to speak to those, although those are very worthwhile researching, understanding  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:12:55):**  and applying because many of them do work very well in the right situations.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:00):**  So the pieces that I'm referring to here are relatively low tech and they're very effective.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:05):**  The first, combining the nitrogen application with sulfur.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:10):**  So adding ammonium thiosulfate, for example, ammonium thiosulfate is a 12-0-0-26, 26% in  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:18):**  sulfur.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:19):**  And the goal is to add thiosol to a liquid nitrogen application in such a ratio that  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:28):**  we have 10% of nitrogen as sulfur so that we achieve that 10 to one nitrogen ratio.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:34):**  This is very inexpensive to apply and makes a difference almost immediately.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:41):**  The second piece is adding stable humic substances such as humicarb, a very concentrated and  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:52):**  very stable carbon source, which has a very large complexing capacity and holding capacity  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:13:58):**  that is referred to as AEC, anion exchange capacity, which I'll speak to a bit later  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:03):**  when we talk about phosphorus.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:05):**  So humicarb has the capacity to bind and hold anions similar to what a clay colloid has  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:18):**  the capacity to hold cations.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:20):**  They contain a number of positive charges which allow them to hold negatively charged  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:26):**  ions such as nitrate.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:29):**  This is very different from adding carbon in the form of sugar or molasses, for example.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:35):**  That can also be beneficial, but it has a completely different purpose.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:41):**  So we typically recommend adding humicarb at 10% of the nitrogen percentage.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:49):**  For example, if you have liquid 32 UAN 3200, 10% of that nitrogen number would be 3%.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:14:59):**  So to that total solution, we would add 3% humicarb.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:04):**  And we found that that is adequate to stabilize and hold almost all of the nitrogen in that  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:11):**  solution and prevent it from flushing and moving quickly with the water profile.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:17):**  I specifically mentioned humicarb.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:21):**  We have not found this same effect to be true for other humic acids and other humic substances  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:28):**  to the same degree.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:29):**  I believe this is true because the humicarb being manufactured and still retaining the  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:36):**  human fraction, not being chemically extracted humic acid.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:41):**  When you have humic acid that is extracted with potassium hydroxide or other alkali solutions,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:48):**  there is still some of the anion exchange capacity present.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:52):**  You still have the capacity to hold nitrate, but to a greatly reduced degree.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:15:56):**  Of course, there's many different sources, but many of the alkali extractions have the  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:01):**  capacity to hold about 10 to 15% of the nitrogen that humicarb does, which means that you need  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:08):**  to apply seven to 10 times more in order to have the same effect.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:13):**  The third piece that you can add is rebound molybdenum at one pint per acre.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:20):**  The purpose for adding molybdenum is that it is the enzyme cofactor for the nitrate  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:27):**  reductase enzyme, which is needed by the bacteria in the rhizosphere to convert nitrate to amino  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:34):**  acids.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:35):**  A small amount makes a very rapid difference very quickly.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:39):**  The fourth piece is adding Rejuvenate.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:43):**  Here we now have another carbon source.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:47):**  Rejuvenate contains a substantial amount of molasses in addition to a whole range of other  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:50):**  enzyme cofactors and microbial biostimulants.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:54):**  Because of the molasses component, it's a very strong bacterial biostimulant, which  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:16:59):**  is very valuable in this situation because bacteria do not thrive in an environment with  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:05):**  concentrated nitrogen applications.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:07):**  If you apply a band of liquid 28 or 32 or a CAN 17 or whatever the case might be, it's  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:16):**  a strong oxidizer and it really suppresses the bacterial population right in the band  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:22):**  of that zone.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:25):**  You are suppressing the bacteria that you want to convert the nitrogen application into  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:31):**  amino acids.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:32):**  This is a problem.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:33):**  This is why Rejuvenate is so valuable.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:36):**  Humicarb helps a lot to buffer out that effect and it already begins having an impact on  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:41):**  the bacterial population.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:43):**  The Rejuvenate is a strong bacterial biostimulant that really invigorates that bacterial population  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:49):**  and allows it to recover very, very quickly and really begin binding up and tying up the  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:54):**  nitrogen and preventing it from moving through the soil.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:17:58):**  The other key piece, of course, in addition to being a biostimulant is that it contains  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:02):**  some of that liquid carbon fraction that is needed where it can actually supply a carbohydrate  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:08):**  source to begin balancing out some of the nitrogen that is in the profile.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:15):**  Now it's not enough.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:17):**  It's not enough in and of itself.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:18):**  If you wanted to supply all of the sugars that were needed, all the carbohydrates that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:26):**  were needed to bind all of that nitrogen and convert it to amino acids, you'd be looking  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:32):**  at applying a fairly substantial quantity of sugar.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:35):**  It would be incredibly powerful if you had the capacity to do that.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:38):**  We've worked with a couple of small-scale fruit and vegetable growers who conducted  
**[0:18:42-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:42):**  experiments and you get some really incredible soil and plant responses.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:51):**  If you're able to add larger quantities of carbohydrates with your nitrogen application,  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:18:57):**  it makes a really big difference.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:00):**  Five percent of the nitrogen solution is not enough, but it's enough to make a really,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:06):**  really big difference to the bacterial population and really get them started very aggressively.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:12):**  If you look at the summary, four pieces, ammonium thiosulfate, humacarb, molybdenum, and Rejuvenate.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:19):**  I know from a lot of field experience that when you combine these four pieces, I can  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:26):**  say with complete confidence that you can apply 100 units of nitrogen per acre or 150  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:33):**  units of nitrogen per acre, even in extreme examples, which I do not recommend.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:37):**  I would strongly prefer to put on smaller doses more frequently rather than really aggressive  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:43):**  and intense applications all at one shot.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:46):**  But I know from experience that when we combine these treatments and add them to our liquid  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:19:53):**  nitrogen applications, we can bind all of that nitrogen, can prevent it from leaching  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:00):**  and still maintain it in a very plant-available form.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:03):**  In other words, it's available, but not soluble.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:06):**  And this is very powerful and very important.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:09):**  There is a relatively straightforward trade-off between the cost of this application and nitrogen  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:16):**  efficiency.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:17):**  Many of the growers that we have worked with add this to their nitrogen application, and  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:23):**  it's very safe on almost all soils and almost all conditions to reduce nitrogen applications  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:30):**  by 30% when you add this, because you're not going to lose any of it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:34):**  It's going to stay there.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:35):**  And you can add these materials, the humacarb, Rejuvenate, and the molybdenum to the solution.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:42):**  You should be adding the ammonium thiosulfate anyway.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:44):**  These are the three materials you can add to the solution.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:47):**  And depending on where commercial nitrogen costs are, of course, in the form that you're  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:51):**  deploying, you might be spending a few dollars more per acre, but the crop response and the  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:57):**  soil response is really substantial.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:20:59):**  It's absolutely worth it.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:02):**  So we're going to switch gears and speak about phosphorus for a little bit.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:09):**  Phosphorus is, of phosphorus and nitrogen, phosphorus is perhaps the biggest challenge  
**[0:21:13-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:13):**  from a water pollution perspective in terms of the impact that it has on the health of  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:21):**  water reservoirs and rivers and streams and lakes and oceans, et cetera.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:26):**  The thing that we have to remember is phosphorus is quite insoluble in natural systems, both  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:33):**  in soil and in water.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:36):**  And as a result, a very small amount of phosphorus in the water can have a huge impact.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:45):**  If I'm not mistaken, I believe that the phosphorus levels required to produce a substantial algae  
**[0:21:54-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:21:54):**  bloom are between 10 and 35 parts per billion with B. So we're looking at very, very small  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:04):**  phosphorus concentrations in the water profile that can make a really big difference in water  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:09):**  quality.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:10):**  So it leaves as soluble phosphorus shortly after application.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:17):**  That shortly depends on the form that it was applied in, the quantity that it was applied  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:22):**  in, and the soil type.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:24):**  That can be a few days to a few weeks.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:27):**  It can leave while it is still in a soluble form.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:31):**  If you get a lot of rainfall, it can leave from runoff or from leachate through the soil  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:36):**  profile in a relatively straightforward fashion.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:40):**  The second way that phosphorus leaves soil is with soil particles.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:46):**  And it's unfortunate if we're losing phosphorus from the soil profile by losing soil particles.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:54):**  But I believe, and I'll explain why I believe this, I believe that in fact a great deal  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:22:59):**  of phosphorus pollution happens when soil particles leave the farm.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:04):**  I believe that is true because phosphorus does not stay soluble in the soil for very  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:10):**  long.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:11):**  Even when it is applied in the soluble form, in a matter of weeks, the great majority of  
**[0:23:16-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:16):**  it is complexed because it doesn't remain soluble in natural systems very readily.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:25):**  Phosphorus exists in the soil profile in four different buckets, if you will.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:30):**  I want to speak briefly about each of these and describe how they work and what's happening  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:36):**  and what's going on.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:37):**  First, you have these four different buckets.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:39):**  You have orthophosphates, which is the soluble form of phosphorus that plant roots absorb.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:44):**  You have that which is microbially complex.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:47):**  In other words, it's bound up in bacterial and fungal bodies in the soil profile.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:52):**  You have that which is adsorbed to soil particles or to humic substances.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:23:57):**  You have that which is existing in the mineral form or in precipitated form from prior soluble  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:06):**  phosphorus applications.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:08):**  Let's look at each of these.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:09):**  I want to explain what's happening with each of these a little bit.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:12):**  The first category, orthophosphates.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:16):**  Plants primarily absorb phosphorus in the orthophosphate form.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:19):**  They can also absorb some levels of polyphosphates.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:24):**  But orthophosphates are the preferred, the most efficient, the most effective.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:28):**  And generally, there are only very small amounts of orthophosphates in a natural soil environment  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:36):**  at any given moment.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:37):**  Typically, we're looking at one pound per acre or even less.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:43):**  You can even have only a half a pound per acre of soluble orthophosphate.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:47):**  However, I'm speaking of a natural soil environment where you have not applied soluble phosphorus  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:52):**  fertilizers.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:53):**  That's a very small amount.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:24:55):**  The key is that that small amount can be replenished from the other reserves on a continual basis  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:01):**  and is replenished continually in a natural system.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:05):**  When a synthetic phosphorus fertilizer is applied, let's say it's a dry granular map  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:14):**  or DAP or it can be a liquid orthophosphate or a polyphosphate like 10-34-0.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:20):**  When that phosphorus is applied, it moves into these four other containers that are  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:29):**  present in the soil profile.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:31):**  A large amount of it is going to quickly precipitate out and join the mineral fraction.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:38):**  In other words, it's going to become complexed and locked up and not available.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:43):**  Some of it can be adsorbed onto slow particles very quickly.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:47):**  In fact, the majority of applied phosphorus will go to the adsorbed bucket or to the precipitate  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:54):**  bucket in a matter of as little as three to six weeks after application.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:25:59):**  In the meantime, in that three to six-week period, substantial amounts of it are converted  
**[0:26:04-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:04):**  to the orthophosphate form and it also has a very damaging effect to the microbial population.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:15):**  It shuts down the microbial population in the rhizosphere that has the capacity to solubilize  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:22):**  phosphorus later in the growing season.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:23):**  This is a really big deal and very important.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:25):**  I want to describe this in a little bit.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:27):**  In this microbially complexed category, we know very little about what happens with microbial  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:37):**  interactions in the rhizosphere.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:40):**  But the few pieces that we think we understand are that one, most of the crops that we're  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:47):**  producing with a few exceptions are colonized by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:26:55):**  One of the things that mycorrhizal fungi are known for is solubilizing phosphorus.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:01):**  More recently, we've identified that there is actually a third symbiotic group.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:08):**  It's not just that plants have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, but in  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:12):**  fact, plants have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which have a symbiotic  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:17):**  relationship with phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:21):**  The three of these work together, so plants actually are giving photosynthesis and sugars  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:27):**  to the mycorrhizal fungi, and the mycorrhizal fungi are transferring some of those root  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:32):**  exudates and those sugars to the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:37):**  So you have this three-level symbiotic relationship.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:41):**  The phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, they're very effective at producing the phosphatase  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:47):**  enzyme and the phytase enzyme and other enzymes, which can fracture the phosphorus-containing  
**[0:27:54-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:27:54):**  minerals such as appetite and tricalcium phosphate, et cetera, that exist in the soil mineral  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:02):**  profile.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:03):**  So they can actually extract and release locked up, tied up phosphorus in the soil profile.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:10):**  This mineralization process occurs most rapidly at soil temperatures in the neighborhood of  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:15):**  about 65 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:18):**  The reason this is worth describing a little bit is because whenever we apply a soluble  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:26):**  phosphorus fertilizer, it suppresses both mycorrhizal fungi and the phosphorus-solubilizing  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:35):**  bacteria.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:36):**  This is a big problem.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:38):**  The reason it suppresses mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, we think  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:45):**  we're not entirely certain, but we believe that there is an indirect effect.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:50):**  The plants will only release sugars out through the root system and signal mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:28:59):**  and these bacteria.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:01):**  Plants have the capacity to signal microorganisms for exactly what they need.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:06):**  If they need phosphorus, they provide a flush of sugars to mycorrhizae and to bacteria,  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:16):**  and they also signal them with specific compounds to say, we need more phosphorus.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:23):**  So the mycorrhizal fungi and the bacteria begin releasing large amounts of phosphorus  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:27):**  and feeding it back to the plant.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:30):**  That's where we have this symbiotic mutually beneficial relationship happening.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:34):**  But now, when you have an environment in the root zone, in the rhizosphere, where you have  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:39):**  an abundance of soluble phosphorus, the plant roots begin absorbing that very quickly, and  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:46):**  the plant has an adequate or a generous supply of phosphorus.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:50):**  So it will not transmit the signal, the signaling compounds or the sugars to the mycorrhizae  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:29:57):**  and to the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:00):**  So those populations never develop.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:02):**  Then, three weeks to six weeks later, once the applied phosphorus fertilizer has been  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:11):**  precipitated or locked up in the soil profile, all of a sudden, the plant now has a functional  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:18):**  phosphorus deficiency.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:20):**  There's no longer phosphorus present in the soil profile, and you also no longer have  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:26):**  mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:30):**  So you've shot yourself in the foot.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:33):**  You have damaged the microbial population in the short term, and it's going to have  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:40):**  long-term effects where you will have limited phosphorus supply later in the growing season,  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:45):**  right at the period when the plant needs them the most for reproduction and the fruit fill.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:51):**  This is why this is so much of a challenge and so much of a problem.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:55):**  All right, let's speak about the next category, the next bucket.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:30:59):**  The next category, adsorbed phosphorus.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:05):**  Everyone understands and talks about a soil's CEC, cation exchange capacity.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:13):**  We understand that sand and silt and clay particles in the soil profile all have some  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:21):**  capacity to hold cations, positively charged elements.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:29):**  What is much less well understood and not frequently described is that many soils also  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:37):**  have what is termed an anion exchange capacity, or AEC instead of CEC.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:43):**  This is particularly true for soils that have clay particles, and also stable humic substances  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:51):**  and organic matter have extremely high anion exchange capacity.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:31:55):**  When soils have a high clay content or they have large proportion of very small soil particles,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:02):**  they can adsorb phosphorus extremely rapidly in extremely large quantities.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:09):**  I referenced that soils can contain as much as 500 pounds per acre of adsorbed phosphorus.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:16):**  Of course, it's difficult to make generalizations because you have such a broad range of soil  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:21):**  types, but in fact, there are some soil types where you have higher clay content, where  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:26):**  you can have as much as 1500 to 1800 pounds of adsorbed phosphorus in the soil profile.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:32):**  And I'm just referring to the top six inches.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:34):**  So some soils have tremendous phosphorus holding capacity.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:40):**  And by the way, this is phosphorus that will never show up on most soil analysis.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:45):**  It won't show up on Bray or a Melek-3 analysis or even Olson or most of the commonly used  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:50):**  soil analysis.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:52):**  So the key is that roots, plant root systems have very limited access to adsorb phosphorus.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:32:59):**  It's not particularly soluble.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:01):**  It doesn't move in soil solution very readily.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:04):**  And it's mostly released by microbial mineralization.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:08):**  When the orthophosphates become very limited, less than a pound per acre, then a small amount  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:14):**  of the adsorbed phosphorus begins being released and shifts from adsorbed phosphorus to the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:19):**  orthophosphate.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:20):**  But it happens very slowly.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:23):**  And it happens through the microbial mineralization process for the most part.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:28):**  Also worth mentioning, applied phosphorus can be bound and can be adsorbed very quickly.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:34):**  The fourth category is mineral phosphorus or precipitated phosphorus in the soil profile.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:44):**  So phosphorus precipitates, this would be tricalcium phosphate, apatite, hydroxyapatite.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:50):**  There's a broad different array of minerals that are formed.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:33:55):**  So most many soils, and again, making some very broad generalizations here because there's  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:01):**  many different soil types all across the continent.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:05):**  But there are many, many loam soils, particularly clay loam soils, often will contain as much  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:12):**  as 9,000 pounds per acre of phosphorus in the top six inches in the mineral form.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:18):**  When we add soluble phosphorus as a liquid or dry phosphorus application, within a matter  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:26):**  of a few weeks, they tend to move to either adsorbed phosphorus or to mineral precipitates.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:32):**  So precipitation reactions, they can happen very quickly, particularly in acidic or alkaline  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:40):**  soils.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:41):**  So in acidic soils, phosphorus reacts very quickly with iron or aluminum and manganese.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:48):**  The reason it is attracted to those three in particular is because phosphorus has a  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:34:55):**  triple negative charge and iron and aluminum and some isotopes of manganese have a triple  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:00):**  positive charge.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:01):**  And this is why there are such low levels of soluble phosphorus in natural ecosystems  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:07):**  because it becomes complexed and tied up very, very quickly.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:12):**  In alkaline soils, phosphorus tends to react with calcium and form tri calcium phosphate,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:19):**  where you have three calciums that have a double positive for a total of six bonded  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:24):**  with two phosphorus that have a triple positive for a total of six as well.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:30):**  So the important part, however, is that root systems cannot absorb precipitated phosphorus  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:37):**  or mineral phosphorus in the soil profile.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:39):**  It is locked up in mineral reserves.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:42):**  It is not soluble and not available.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:45):**  And in fact, there is some research which indicates that the phosphorus which has been  
**[0:35:50-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:50):**  applied to the soil and then precipitates out may in fact be more difficult for microbes  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:35:59):**  and bacteria to release than the native mineral phosphorus that is already existing in the  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:06):**  soil profile, which is something that I'm certainly looking forward to learning much  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:10):**  more about.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:11):**  We have huge quantities available and we have greater than 9,000 pounds in the top six inches.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:17):**  That's more than we can harvest with hundreds of years of crops, not even to speak of all  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:22):**  of the remaining phosphorus in the soil profile below that.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:26):**  And if we want to tap into that, we can tap into that, but we need aggressive bacterial  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:33):**  and fungal digestive processes happening in order for that to happen.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:38):**  So this is the challenge that we often see happening in agriculture.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:44):**  Growers apply substantial quantities of soluble phosphorus where they are actually then unable  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:52):**  to tap into the tremendous phosphorus reserves that are already in the soil profile.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:36:59):**  In essence, as long as you continue to suppress that fungal and bacterial system, you will  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:06):**  never be able to tap into the tremendous reserves of phosphorus that are already existing, that  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:10):**  are already out there.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:12):**  So the ultimate in the soil health and soil performance is when we rearrange those four  
**[0:37:18-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:18):**  buckets a little bit and now we look at how we can tap into the adsorbed and the mineral  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:26):**  and precipitate phosphorus.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:28):**  In an optimal environment, the adsorbed and the mineral phosphorus is being digested and  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:34):**  processed by bacteria and fungi and then is being converted and solubilized and released  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:41):**  in the orthophosphate form.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:43):**  So this is an ecosystem where there is no need for synthetic phosphorus applications  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:51):**  of any kind.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:53):**  Now you may be thinking that sounds quite idealistic and utopian, that's not realistic  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:37:57):**  and that's not practical, but in reality, a number of farms are implementing this today  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:04):**  very successfully on a very large scale.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:08):**  This is not idealistic.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:09):**  This is not a pipe dream.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:11):**  We have the knowledge and the information today to develop soil ecosystems where we  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:17):**  do not need to apply any soluble synthetic phosphorus and we can achieve continually  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:25):**  increasing yields and continually increasing crop quality.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:30):**  There are farms that are doing this successfully and have been doing it successfully for over  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:33):**  a decade.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:34):**  And of course, to achieve this, we really need to take an ecosystems approach.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:39):**  So the growers who are doing this successfully are using crop rotations, they're using cover  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:44):**  crops, they're doing a number of things well to maintain the vigorous microbial population  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:51):**  that is required to achieve this level of performance.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:55):**  But it is possible.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:38:57):**  In situations where we're not able to have crop rotations and cover crops, if we're growing  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:03):**  salad greens or strawberries on a continual basis, that is going to be a cropping system  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:09):**  where we may need to continue applying small amounts of phosphorus.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:14):**  This is the ideal that we want to strive for, but we're not there yet.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:19):**  We're still back here.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:20):**  So how do we get to more closely approximating this to a partially integrated ecosystem that  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:27):**  is much more vibrant and much more healthy?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:30):**  Here are a couple of the keys.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:32):**  So when we begin working with growers to help them through a transition, there are a couple  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:37):**  of pieces that we begin looking at right away.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:40):**  We want to reduce the quantity of applied phosphorus fertilizers per application.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:46):**  So rather than putting on large doses in one shot, we would much rather spoon feed it over  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:51):**  an extended period of time.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:52):**  This is just common sense.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:54):**  I'm sure that all of you already know this and most of you are already doing it.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:39:59):**  The second piece is to buffer and stabilize that applied phosphorus fertilizer so that  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:07):**  it is available but not soluble.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:10):**  And so that we can increase crop utilization from 15% up to 60 plus percent.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:15):**  This is something that I didn't speak about, but there is in fact quite a bit of research  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:20):**  which indicates that when soluble phosphorus is applied to the soil profile, as much as  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:27):**  90% of it is either adsorbed or precipitated in between 20 and 40 days.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:35):**  Say what?  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:36):**  You think about that for a moment.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:39):**  90% of applied soluble phosphorus is precipitated out or adsorbed and is no longer plant available  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:48):**  between 20 and 40 days.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:50):**  This is a very general statement and in some soil environments, some cropping systems,  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:40:58):**  I'm sure are doing better than that.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:01):**  You might have only 80% or only 70% being complexed in a matter of 60 or 70 days.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:07):**  Perhaps it's happening slower.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:09):**  Perhaps you're losing less.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:11):**  But even fertilizer manufacturers in their own research indicate that at best 30% of  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:20):**  the phosphorus that is applied is absorbed by the crop.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:23):**  So this is an incredibly inefficient and incredibly wasteful form of fertilization.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:30):**  When you stop to think about it, there's no common sense at all.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:33):**  There is a much better way and we know how to do that.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:36):**  So the third piece, we can add the phosphorus-solubilizing microbes, the mycorrhizal fungi, the phosphorus-solubilizing  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:44):**  bacteria and biostimulants, which really stimulate those.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:49):**  So we're applying a little bit less fertilizer.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:53):**  And because we're applying less fertilizer, that means we are now having a much less damaging  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:41:57):**  effect on the soil biology.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:01):**  And we are counteracting that very limited damaging effect with all the biostimulants  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:09):**  that we're adding.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:10):**  And so as a result, we get this flush of available phosphorus that is in the microbially complex  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:19):**  form.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:20):**  I've suggested that you can have up to 50 pounds per acre of phosphorus in the microbially  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:24):**  complex form.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:25):**  I know actually for certain that that is a conservative number.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:30):**  And again, this varies so widely based on organic matter levels and bacterial and fungal  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:37):**  populations.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:38):**  But this is essentially the phosphorus that is contained within the fungal and bacterial  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:41):**  biomass.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:43):**  The moment the plant sends the signal that it needs phosphorus, it's instantly there.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:50):**  It is instantly there.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:53):**  So you will never have a phosphorus-deficient crop as long as you have a generous supply  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:42:59):**  of microbially complexed phosphorus.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:03):**  That's really the form that you want it to be in.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:05):**  Okay, how do you do this?  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:07):**  How do you get there?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:08):**  There's essentially a couple of key pieces.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:12):**  Over to what I spoke of regarding nitrogen management, humic substances are unique in  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:21):**  that unlike soil particles, they have a very high anion exchange capacity and they can  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:29):**  complex anions.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:31):**  So in much the same way that humicarb can complex and stabilize nitrate, it can also  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:37):**  complex and stabilize phosphate.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:40):**  When you add humicarb to a phosphorus fertilizer, it is going to buffer that fertilizer so that  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:49):**  it doesn't have the negative effect on soil biology.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:53):**  And it's also going to stabilize it so that it doesn't become adsorb and it doesn't precipitate  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:43:59):**  out nearly as quickly.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:00):**  So it's going to hold that phosphorus in the phosphorus form that it was applied in for  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:05):**  a much longer period of time.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:06):**  That of course is going to give you much better crop performance and longer period of absorption.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:11):**  When you start to think about it, the most efficient numbers are 30%.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:16):**  The average efficiency is generally assumed to be in the neighborhood of 5 to 15%.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:21):**  So let's just say 10% for the sake of discussion.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:24):**  That means if you apply fertilizer, let's say MAP 1152-0 at 100 pounds per acre, you're  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:31):**  applying 52 units of phosphorus.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:34):**  If only 10% of that is being plant absorbed, it's 5 pounds of phosphorus.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:40):**  Let's be very generous.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:41):**  Let's go with a 30% number.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:43):**  30% of applied phosphorus is still only 15 pounds per acre.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:47):**  Adding humic substances to phosphorus fertilizers increases plant utilization by 30%.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:54):**  So right there, there's one piece that can give you a 30% increase in the efficiency  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:44:58):**  of your phosphorus fertilizer applications.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:00):**  And of course, when you stabilize it, it also means it's now not going to be water soluble  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:07):**  and it's not going to leach and cause water pollution effects.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:11):**  The second piece is using BioCoat Gold.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:14):**  So BioCoat Gold is a combination of the mycorrhizal fungi and the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria  
**[0:45:21-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:21):**  that I mentioned that we use as a root treatment or as a seed treatment and combine this with  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:30):**  a rejuvenated application to get a strong biostimulant effect to establish these microbes  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:35):**  and give them a very strong and a very aggressive start.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:39):**  Combining these microbial inoculants and biostimulants, stabilizing phosphorus applications  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:46):**  with stable humic substances, reducing the application quantity and spreading them out  
**[0:45:51-0:45:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:51):**  over a period of time, you can greatly reduce the quantity of phosphorus that you need to  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:45:58):**  apply to produce a crop to the point where if you are able to incorporate cover crops  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:04):**  and crop rotations, there's no question and no doubt in my mind that you can get to the  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:08):**  point where you can eliminate the need for any phosphorus application and simply tap  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:13):**  into all the phosphorus that you have accumulated from historical phosphorus applications, as  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:18):**  well as from a native geological profile.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:22):**  I didn't state this explicitly, although it was somewhat implied in the approach that  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:29):**  I described.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:30):**  To manage phosphorus well, you really need to take an ecosystem approach.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:35):**  You have to manage the entire ecosystem.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:36):**  Well, it's not quite as straightforward as managing nitrate because there is a longer  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:44):**  term response from the phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:49):**  The response is a little bit slower, a little bit more delayed than it is with converting  
**[0:46:52-0:46:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:52):**  nitrates to amino acids.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:46:54):**  However, one of the pieces that I didn't speak to was how do you prevent soil particles from  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:02):**  moving?  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:03):**  It's one thing to prevent or to reduce the soluble phosphorus levels, but how do you  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:09):**  reduce soil, particularly clay particles, very small soil particles, which are the easiest  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:14):**  to move, of course, taking phosphorus with them.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:17):**  However, we're talking about 10 to 35 parts per billion of phosphorus in a water reservoir  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:25):**  being able to produce a tremendous algae bloom, practically nothing.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:30):**  A very small amount of clay in the water column from erosion can contain that quantity of  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:36):**  phosphorus.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:37):**  It doesn't take very much.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:38):**  This, of course, could be an entire other conversation, but the headline is simply that  
**[0:47:44-0:47:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:44):**  we need to bind these small clay particles and form larger, more stable soil aggregates  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:53):**  and larger crumb structure, stable crumb structure within the soil profile, which, oh, by the  
**[0:47:58-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:47:58):**  way, is something that mycorrhizal fungi does extremely well producing this peptide, this  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:05):**  compound called glomalin, which is essentially soil glue, which takes all these small particles  
**[0:48:12-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:12):**  and bonds them together into much larger, more stable soil aggregates.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:18):**  When you inoculate soils with mycorrhizal fungi and you maintain strong populations  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:23):**  of mycorrhizal fungi, not only do you have the effect of solubilizing and releasing phosphorus  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:28):**  for the plant, but you also have the effect of stabilizing the crumb structure within  
**[0:48:33-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:33):**  the soil profile and reducing the free clay particles that can move off the soil with  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:42):**  erosion.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:43):**  Managing erosion is a whole other topic in and of itself, and the need to keep the soil  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:51):**  covered with a living cover crop or a mulch or whatever the case might be.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:48:55):**  You can greatly reduce erosion and greatly reduce the movement of these small clay particles  
**[0:49:02-0:49:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:02):**  where you have this cloudy, milky water by maintaining active mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:11):**  So thank you very much for attending.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:14):**  I hope that you found it useful.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:16):**  And if you have any feedback or any topics that you would love for me to speak about  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:20):**  in the future, I would love very much to hear from you.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:22):**  Thanks everyone.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:23):**  Bye.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:24):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:32):**  a leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:35):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:39):**  ways to grow crops.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:40):**  We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:45):**  crops, we must first think different about agriculture, about empowering life instead  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:50):**  of suppressing life, about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:54):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:49:58):**  with less risk of crop failure.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:50:00):**  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-to-prevent-nitrogen-and-phosphorous-leaching/#t=0:50:04):**  Thanks for listening.

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm John Kempf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:06):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:03):**  welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. On this podcast, we work to explore the science  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:10):**  of growing really exceptional crops and to describe why you have crop challenges and how  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:16):**  we can resolve them. Our goal is to give you really clear and easy to understand and actionable  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:23):**  information that we can actually implement in the field. Many of us as growers have had experiences  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:29):**  where we have these unusual and intriguing observations where we observe that we have major  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:35):**  pest problems in one part of a field, but not in another part of the field, that has been managed  
**[0:02:39-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:39):**  in exactly the same way. Or we grow a given variety of a crop in two fields with the essentially  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:47):**  the exact same management and same types of products being applied, and yet sometimes get  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:53):**  completely different results, sometimes dramatically different results where we get much higher yields  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:02:58):**  in one field or in one section of a field than we do elsewhere. Why is that? Why is that happening?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:03):**  And how can we replicate that level of success over a much broader area? These are the types of  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:09):**  questions that we work to unravel and unwrap and really understand why, what's going on, how things  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:17):**  are happening, and how we can replicate that level of success on a much larger scale. So today, I'm  
**[0:03:23-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:23):**  excited to welcome onto the podcast Michael McNeil. Michael is one of these wise elders of agriculture.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:33):**  Michael has been a very close mentor as I have been learning about crops and growing amazing  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:39):**  crops in the agricultural field and has also become a very close friend. Michael has a very  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:43):**  impressive background in agronomy, has a degree in plant physiology and in genetics, and has spent  
**[0:03:50-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:50):**  a very long and very successful career in the Midwest working with many growers on a broad range  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:03:58):**  of different challenges and has a very interesting background. So Michael, welcome to the show. We're  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:04):**  excited to have you here. Thank you, John. It's fun to be here. Michael, can you, can we perhaps begin  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:09):**  by understanding a little bit more of your work? Can you begin by giving us, telling us a little  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:14):**  bit about your background and the work that you are doing on a day-to-day basis on your operation?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:20):**  Well, I was born and raised on a farm northwest of Algona, Iowa, and I'm still farming that farm today.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:29):**  I have watched it go from pretty much all horses and horse-drawn equipment to our modern-day  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:40):**  tractors that are GPS guided across the field. So it's been quite a transition that I've gotten to  
**[0:04:48-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:48):**  see, and I've learned a lot along the way. I have had the fortune, I guess, to see that kind of  
**[0:04:57-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:04:57):**  farming, and I see perhaps a need to return to a portion of what my grandfather was doing back in  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:07):**  those days. And I don't necessarily mean you got to sell our tractors and buy horses, but some of  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:14):**  the things that he did to improve soil health and maintain soil fertility are things that we really  
**[0:05:20-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:20):**  need to be thinking about today. In my operation, I've, the past couple years, have decided to go  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:30):**  totally organic with it, which makes it a bit unusual, but somewhat commonplace for around  
**[0:05:36-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:36):**  our community. We have, I think the last numbers I saw was around 42,000 acres of organic crop in  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:46):**  the two-county area here where I live. Wow, that's grown quite substantially. It's a huge change, and  
**[0:05:55-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:05:55):**  I know that there is a sort of a stigma if, when you talk about organic farmers, many times they  
**[0:06:04-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:04):**  think of the guy that's farming a 20 or 40 acre patch that's just covered with weeds, and the  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:13):**  farmers in our community that we're working with range all the way from a half section, 320 acres  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:20):**  of land, to 15,000 acres of land, and they're pretty much weed free. Very, very excellent farmers.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:29):**  They've learned a lot about weed management, weed control, soil fertility, soil health, so I'm pretty  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:37):**  excited to see that change, but it does remind me a bit of the things that my grandfather taught me  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:43):**  years and years ago, and that's the way he took care of his crops. So I really, I want to, I want  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:50):**  to circle back and dig into that a bit more, but before we go there, can you tell us a little bit  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:06:56):**  about your professional work and what you do professionally in addition to the farming operation?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:02):**  Okay, well I left the farm for a few years and went to, I guess you call it formal education at Iowa State  
**[0:07:10-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:10):**  University, where I majored in agronomy, got my BS degree in soils and soil fertility, and then I  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:22):**  became quite interested in how that impacted plant growth. So I had my master's degree in plant  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:27):**  physiology, and then I was intrigued with how genetics worked and how the environment impacted  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:35):**  on genetics, so I ended up getting my PhD in quantitative genetics, and along that same path,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:43):**  I also became interested in plant diseases and had a minor in plant pathology, and  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:50):**  after leaving the university, I spent some time with a facility located in Frederick, Maryland, where  
**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:07:59):**  we studied the impact of diseases that could be used as a weapon and how we could defend our  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:07):**  crops against that type of thing, and learned a great deal about how fertility and genetics and  
**[0:08:15-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:15):**  things like that create an environment that we can protect ourselves from any pathogenic  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:25):**  invasion, if you will. Wow, that sounds intriguing, and then where did that lead you from there?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:31):**  Well, I became a corn breeder and I worked for a major company for 12 years, managed a  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:40):**  corn breeding research station. I started their soybean breeding project as well as continuing  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:48):**  the corn breeding project. I did that for about 12 years, and during that time, farmers would ask me  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:08:56):**  probably more fertility and soil fertility questions than they did genetic questions,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:02):**  and I kept trying to explain how the two kind of worked together, and that was about the time  
**[0:09:12-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:12):**  that GMOs were being invented, and we were using gene guns and blasting gold dust through genes and  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:23):**  trying to move them from one thing into another thing, and we started taking genes out of them  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:30):**  started taking genes out of different species and moving them around, taking genes out of bacteria  
**[0:09:38-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:38):**  and putting them in a corn plant. That whole thing really didn't fit with my, I guess, thoughts about  
**[0:09:49-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:09:49):**  how our species were created and why they were created and who was man to mix with them and we're  
**[0:10:00-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:00):**  into opening Pandora's box to who knows what when you started doing that, and so I chose to step out  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:10):**  of that type of breeding work, sticking still mainly with my quantitative genetics approach  
**[0:10:20-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:20):**  versus the gene gun approach, and got more into soil health, soil fertility, and genotype by  
**[0:10:30-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:30):**  fertility interactions, and that led me into a profession of agricultural consulting. I started  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:38):**  working with farmers and explaining how all this worked, and it got to be a pretty exciting  
**[0:10:44-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:44):**  adventure. I started with a farmer, he had 160 acres, and then his neighbor added another 160 to it,  
**[0:10:53-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:10:53):**  and I'm now up to about 165,000 acres that I work on, so that's sort of a history of how I got to  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:02):**  where I am today. And when you say you have about 165,000 acres that you work on today, what is  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:09):**  the scope of the work that you do on each of these farms? Most of it is working with soil health and  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:14):**  soil fertility and helping them select the right genetics for the fertility programs that they're  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:21):**  working with. Soil health is becoming a bigger and bigger issue for me to deal with. When I first  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:29):**  started it wasn't a really big issue, it's huge now, and so I'm devoting more of my time now  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:37):**  to soil health than I ever thought I would. So I'd love to talk about that a little bit.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:43):**  When you say that soil health didn't used to be a big issue, now you're spending a lot of time on  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:49):**  that. What has changed with soil health? How are you managing it differently today from what  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:11:56):**  you needed to 20 or 30 years ago? Well interesting that you would ask me that, John. The other day I  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:02):**  was cleaning out a drawer on my desk and I found some old pictures that I had taken back  
**[0:12:11-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:11):**  1972, 1973 of crops that were growing. I had some close-ups and some kind of overviews of the field.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:20):**  And the thing that I noticed was how healthy the plants were. There were no disease lesions on them  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:27):**  anywhere. The corn plants were just perfect and the whole field was that way. It's really hard  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:36):**  to find a field today that is that way. And I got to looking at the weeds that were going along the  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:44):**  fence rows and they were big and healthy and looked great. They don't look so good today, comparatively  
**[0:12:50-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:50):**  speaking. And you say, well maybe that's a good thing. No it's not. The whole area that we're farming  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:12:58):**  is unhealthy. And so I asked the question, well what's changed? And what I really see the big  
**[0:13:05-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:05):**  difference being from that era until today is that farmers have been drawn into, I guess I call it  
**[0:13:16-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:16):**  big ag, and you need to use herbicides. You don't want to use a cultivator. You got to get over more  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:23):**  land. So you use herbicides and these herbicides then are doing things to the soil because they're  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:30):**  all chelators. So now the plants become a little bit imbalanced in the nutrition that they're taking  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:37):**  up and you find more disease. You find more insect pressures. So we start using fungicides  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:45):**  and insecticides, more chelators, more poisons being dumped onto the ground. And we were pretty  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:13:53):**  impressed with how they work. Boy the field was perfectly clean, weed free, excellent. The diseases  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:00):**  were dramatically reduced. The fungicides worked really well. The corn borers and some other the  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:07):**  insects that were issues went away. It was magic. The chemistry was totally magic and looked  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:16):**  beautiful. But as time went on, it started poisoning the good things that were in the soil.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:23):**  And so today I am called out to look at farms where the guy's production has dropped off dramatically  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:30):**  and the soil is virtually dead. When you say the production has dropped off dramatically,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:35):**  what have you observed? What I have seen is looking at 10-year crop insurance records,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:43):**  the guy was getting 190 to 210 bushel per acre at around 200 bushel 10-year average.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:50):**  Excellent, excellent yields. Now it's getting 70 and 80 bushel yields. Wow. That's dramatic.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:14:58):**  And we'll put him out of business very quickly. That is very dramatic. This isn't like, oh this  
**[0:15:05-0:15:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:05):**  is a little field here, a farm there. I mean I'm seeing eight and ten thousand acre farms that this  
**[0:15:12-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:12):**  has happened to. And that really, really woke me up. I started seeing this about five years ago.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:22):**  So I've been working with these growers and can I remediate that? Can I bring it back?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:27):**  And in a three to four year period we've had pretty good success. I would say we're back  
**[0:15:34-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:34):**  we're back now into where we were when this crashed. But the farmers are excited that they  
**[0:15:43-0:15:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:43):**  can now take it to a different yield plateau in the 250 bushel range or greater. And they can see  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:51):**  growth and potential in doing what they're doing. And they've moved away from GMO crops and  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:15:58):**  particularly moved away from the use of glyphosate. So I think these are the very important pieces for  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:04):**  us to talk about and to understand Michael is when you have a degraded, and so the question I have is  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:10):**  when you have a degraded system like that where you have suppressed yields and suppressed soil  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:15):**  health as you're describing it, how do you go from depressed yields of 70 to 90 bushels per acre back  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:23):**  up to 200 with aspirations of going back up to 250 bushels per acre? How do you achieve that?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:30):**  Well it's a long hard task really. There's no silver bullets. You got to kind of figure out what all  
**[0:16:37-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:37):**  what all was going wrong and stop doing that, number one. Number two, you're going to have to look at  
**[0:16:45-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:45):**  at what is it going to take to remediate the soil? Is the soil become really hard?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:53):**  Just and I mean hard like the road. I get penetrometer readings. It takes 500 pounds of down  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:16:59):**  pressure to penetrate the top two inches of soil. That's hard. That's just like a gravel road. It's  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:05):**  just well a crop will not grow on that. When they're tilling it, it's breaking up into  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:11):**  chunks and then when it rains, it puddles and just seals over. And so we get no oxygen into the soil.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:19):**  So you have to maybe incorporate some tillage things and then start getting some food for the  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:27):**  microbial life that's almost non-existent. It's not non-existent because you can bring it back  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:34):**  and that's the good news. If you don't let this thing go too long, you can bring it back.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:39):**  Now whether we're bringing all of it back or not, I don't know. But once you get it started coming  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:45):**  back, then you can look at inoculating with mycorrhizae and some of the things the  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:51):**  cunamona adds, the kennel mycetes that could be missing and get them stimulated to growing.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:17:58):**  But you got to first get the oxygen in the soil, get the water working correctly, get the food right  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:06):**  before you, there's no magic inoculating the soil if it's loaded with poison. It'll just kill your  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:12):**  inoculant. So you got to kind of fix that problem first before you try inoculating and getting  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:19):**  an inoculation. You wouldn't have to do that, but it does speed it up. You gain about a year,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:25):**  maybe two years when you do that. I see people thinking they're buying a magic silver bullet  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:32):**  and inoculating and then continuing to do the things that caused it to die in the first place.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:38):**  They're not winning, they're losing. So let's go back to that for just a moment because you've  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:43):**  iterated several times that you have to stop doing what inflicted the damage in the first place.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:49):**  When you were, from my summary, what I heard you saying just in synopsis was that it's really  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:18:56):**  the herbicides and the fungicides, the insecticide applications that are causing this degradation of  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:02):**  soil health. I heard you mention that these herbicides, these various pesticides that people  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:09):**  are applying are actually chelation agents. I guess the question that I have is why do you  
**[0:19:15-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:15):**  believe that these products are the causal agent for the suppression of soil health? Couldn't it  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:23):**  also be the extensive tillage that we had for a number of decades and some of these other  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:30):**  contributing factors? Well I have some farms that I feel are way over tilled. They're organic  
**[0:19:37-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:37):**  farmers. They really do, I almost feel as excessive tillage doesn't seem to be bothering the soil at  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:45):**  all. It isn't quite as good as I'd like to see it, but as long as they're keeping their organic  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:50):**  matter up, preventing erosion, using cover crops and that sort of thing, the tillage in itself  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:19:58):**  doesn't seem to be doing as much damage than I originally thought. Now having said that,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:05):**  you have to be careful which tillage tools you use. A disk is not a very good tillage tool to be using.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:12):**  It causes compaction, it fractures the soil structure much worse than a tined implement  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:20):**  that would, you could pull through it, whether that be a, I call it a tined implement, but a V-ripper  
**[0:20:26-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:26):**  a narrow pointed field cultivator, not a sweep. These kinds of things do not seem to do  
**[0:20:36-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:36):**  the structural damage that I see with things like a disk or even like a moldboard plow  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:45):**  or a field cultivator with sweeps on it. So in essence you're saying that tillage doesn't have  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:52):**  the damaging effects on soil health as the herbicides do from your perspective?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:20:58):**  Not as bad as the herbicides, not as bad as anhydrous ammonia, and not as bad as the high  
**[0:21:03-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:03):**  salt fertilizers. They tend to be more of an issue and when you put them all together it overwhelms  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:12):**  the soil life system that's going on. So I guess I understand the impact of anhydrous ammonia and  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:21):**  salt fertilizers, obviously both of those are very oxidizing and can have the potential to produce a  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:28):**  lot of damage to the soil's microbial community and to organic matter and so forth, but I don't  
**[0:21:34-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:34):**  understand that herbicides would have that same effect. So you mentioned the herbicides being key  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:41):**  to me because I guess the question that I have is from your perspective, how is it that herbicides  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:47):**  and these various pesticides have such a damaging effect on soil health? Well we have not paid a lot  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:21:53):**  of attention to micronutrients in the soil. Micronutrients are extremely important to plant growth  
**[0:22:00-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:00):**  and they're readily chelated and easily chelated by the pesticides that we use. And once you tie  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:10):**  those up, you start shutting down significant pathways and that's where my physiology training  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:18):**  and background kind of came into play when I started seeing a lot of these physiological processes  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:24):**  being shut down. For example, one that probably is pretty familiar to a lot of people  
**[0:22:30-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:30):**  is if you chelate manganese and tie that up, shut down the shakimic pathway. When you shut that down  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:38):**  then diseases can move in very quickly because that's sort of the plant's immune system, if you  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:43):**  will. You shut that down, then you have to buy fungicides. You put on the fungicides to protect  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:50):**  from disease, it's invaded that, and then you start killing more of the fungal life in the soil  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:22:56):**  and it's a vicious vicious cycle that you set up. You mentioned you believe that perhaps we should  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:04):**  go back to some of the practices that you learned from your grandfather. What are the things that  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:10):**  you learned from him that you think would be relevant and appropriate today? Well, one of the  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:14):**  things was he was very good at crop rotation and we've gotten ourselves into, as I'd almost call it,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:22):**  a monoculture, a biculture if you will, where we go corn and soybeans or soybeans and corn or  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:28):**  corn and soybeans. It's just that's not working well with the soil microbial life and back in the  
**[0:23:36-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:36):**  day he was using horses so he needed feed for those horses. He raised those. Those have a real  
**[0:23:45-0:23:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:45):**  good way of cleansing the soil, bringing more silica available for plant growth, taking toxins  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:23:54):**  out of the soil, and so he was keeping the soil clean just because he needed to produce fuel for  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:01):**  his power. Well, we don't need that today so I get a lot of guys, well why do I grow oats? I don't  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:10):**  need to grow oats. And I say, well think about that as an excellent cover crop. So plant those,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:15):**  get them growing. The winter will kill the oat plant so you don't have to use a herbicide to kill  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:22):**  it in the spring and you've got all these good benefits. You've retained nutrition in the soil,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:29):**  you've retained the nitrogen, you've gotten a very fibrous root system that is going to improve the  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:36):**  soil structure, plenty of food there for microbial life, you're going to have some suppression of  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:42):**  weeds in the spring with that cover that you have there from the oats. So yeah, we can still use that  
**[0:24:49-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:49):**  crop today, we can rotate, but think about using it as a cover crop. He also grew clovers and  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:24:59):**  alfalfas and other legumes that of course benefited the nitrogen for production of the corn.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:07):**  Can we do that? Yes we can, but we need to change the way we look at our land. We have a need  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:17):**  for livestock in the cropping areas and we've kind of taken them out because it's, you can grow  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:25):**  huge numbers of cattle, cattle feedlots better in a warmer climate and that's true, but then you're  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:32):**  shipping all that nutrient into that area where it's more of a waste product than it is a fertilizer  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:39):**  and there is no better fertilizer than animal manures. Michael, we've been talking about,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:46):**  we've been circling around this topic of soil health and the impacts of tillage and herbicides,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:25:54):**  animal manures, cover crops and so forth. If I heard you correctly at the beginning, you mentioned  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:01):**  there is a correlation between soil health and the diseases that are present and if I heard you  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:08):**  correctly, you mentioned some work that you were doing in Maryland studying diseases as a weapon.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:17):**  What did you learn from that experience and how does all of that tie into what we are talking  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:22):**  about? Well if you, for example, let's just pull an example out of the air. Let's say you want to use  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:28):**  a fungal disease, you know, as a weapon and then you can get that introduced into the soil  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:34):**  and not only does it kill the crop this year, it'll continue to kill it into future years.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:40):**  So hey, that's a pretty good weapon. Check down the people's food supply, they have a problem.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:46):**  Well if you have good cunimonids, the cunimonus bacteria in the soil, they kind of act as a  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:26:53):**  policeman in the soil, if you will, and they'll take out the excess pathogenic fungi that can arise.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:00):**  But if you use products like glyphosate, that's an antibiotic type product, you're going to kill  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:08):**  all the cunimonids and so then you have no protection and it's very easy to get a huge  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:14):**  population of fusarium going in the soil which probably is a pathogenic fusarium or pythium or  
**[0:27:22-0:27:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:22):**  phytophthora. You've lost the natural balance that keeps everything in balance and so if you have that  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:30):**  balance present, inoculating it with a pathogenic fungi is not going to do much for you. It'll just  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:37):**  clean it right up. Wow, so you can actually have a disease-suppressive soil where you don't have  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:43):**  challenges with those, but I think I also heard you mention that you were working on developing  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:49):**  solutions to those diseases as weapons. What were the types of solutions that you were working on?  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:27:56):**  Well, I mean there's all kinds of approaches. If you need a fast cure, you know, of course you're  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:02):**  going to look at chemistry and the fungicides and that sort of thing, but what you find is if you get  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:09):**  the soil contaminated, how do you fix that? Because if you put anything on that, you're going to kill  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:15):**  everything in the soil. Using a soil sterilant is not necessarily a great idea and so what you do is  
**[0:28:24-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:24):**  there are things, microbial life in the soil that will hold everything in balance and so if you have  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:32):**  the right nutrition available, those will develop and then everything will take care of itself.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:37):**  It's sort of, I'll use you as an analogy, John. If your nutrition gets pretty poor, you're going to  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:45):**  get pretty run down and you're going to be very susceptible to all kinds of diseases. Would you  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:51):**  agree? Oh, I think that's just the story of the people who are trying to sell me supplements.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:28:56):**  No, I'm making a joke. That's the story of, I understand, but when that occurs, you can say,  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:06):**  okay, well I'm going to take this supplement or this drug to prevent me from this disease,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:13):**  but you're still improperly nourished. You're going to get another disease and then you're  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:18):**  going to get another disease, but if I get your nutrition back and properly, you're going to get  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:25):**  everything back and properly balanced and at everything at correct levels, your immune system  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:30):**  then starts to function properly. A good share of your immune system is in your digestive tract.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:36):**  A lot of microbes working for you and so the soil is no different. You get those microbes working  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:42):**  for you, you're going to stay healthy. The soil is going to stay healthy and so are the plants.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:47):**  Are you saying that when you manage the nutritional balance of the soil and the microbial population  
**[0:29:53-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:29:53):**  that it's possible to grow crops that don't have disease? Yes, when a plant is perfectly healthy,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:02):**  it's very hard to get a disease to invade it and an insect will not even stop to look at it.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:10):**  Why is that? It's because an unhealthy plant cannot convert the sugars that it's produced  
**[0:30:18-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:18):**  into complex sugars, starches, and lignin, which insects and diseases can't use. They can only use  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:27):**  the simple sugars, the nitrate and nitrogens in the plant. The nitrate and nitrogen is taken up by the plant,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:34):**  it's converted into amino acids and proteins immediately in a healthy plant. In an unhealthy  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:39):**  plant, a plant that does not have the right mineral balance to make all those processes and cycles work  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:46):**  will have a pretty heavy load of nitrate in it. Fantastic food for the insect. They can detect that  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:53):**  and they will land on that plant and feed on that plant. So really disease and insects are mother  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:30:59):**  nature's garbage collectors. They're getting rid of the bad stuff, the weak plants. Yeah, these are  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:04):**  pieces that we have spoken about and I've spoken about quite extensively in describing some of the  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:10):**  things that we've observed happening where we developed this diagram called the plant health  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:15):**  pyramid where we describe how plants become resistant to different types of diseases and  
**[0:31:21-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:21):**  different types of insect pests at different stages of physiological development. So this is  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:28):**  something that we've observed in the field very clearly and it's really exciting and a lot of  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:33):**  fun when it starts functioning the way that it was designed to function because all of a sudden  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:39):**  disease and insect pressure dramatically reduces and in many cases you can say that it completely  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:45):**  disappears and that's really exciting. That's a lot of fun. It really is and that's what takes me  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:51):**  way back into the early years when I looked at the plants and they were not having any of these issues.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:31:57):**  Micronutrient levels were excellent. All the processes were functioning properly and there's  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:03):**  very little disease or insect pressure. Yeah, it's very interesting to hear your perspective  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:10):**  over time of how things have changed over a 40 year, 50 year time period. And I didn't really realize  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:16):**  how much it had changed until I pulled out those photos and was looking at them the other day.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:22):**  It was just like wow, it's really, really different. You don't suppose that those photos are just one  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:30):**  off of a really exceptional year? No, they were not taken for that reason. Some of these photos  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:38):**  were taken of pictures of livestock that were going to be sold and they were standing, you know,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:44):**  in the field or by a fence and I was just kind of looking beyond that and looking at the crop.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:50):**  Wow, check that out. You know, otherwise if there's a photo that was taken of an exceptionally good  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:32:55):**  crop or something, I would say yes, you have a point. But no, these photos were taken up and  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:00):**  focused on other things. The crop was in the background but as I observed it, it's like,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:06):**  check that out. It's really looking good. Wow. Well, Michael, there are a number of different  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:13):**  areas in your expertise and your background that we haven't had the chance to explore deeply yet.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:18):**  So, I'm going to move on to a bit of a different question. What has been something that you puzzled  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:26):**  over for a really long time until you and trying to figure something out? What has been something  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:32):**  that really caught your attention in the agriculture space that you've been working on?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:36):**  Well, something that I've already then finally figured out, I think, was the impact of the lack  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:45):**  of availability of the micronutrients in our crops. You know, I mean, it was kind of, yeah,  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:52):**  we should know about that. But until I figured out why that was occurring, I couldn't quite figure  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:33:57):**  out what happened because I was doing tissue testing, for example. I had adequate copper and  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:03):**  iron and manganese and magnesium and calcium. Everything looked good. What I didn't realize  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:09):**  was a lot of those minerals were chelated and tied up into a form that the plant could not use.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:15):**  They yet showed up on a chemistry test when we tested the tissue. And when I finally  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:21):**  figured that out, then everything started to gel for me.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:26):**  So, I think what you're saying is that these various minerals and trace minerals were being  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:33):**  chelated inside the plant tissue by herbicides and fungicides that growers were applying?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:40):**  Yes. And so, when I test them, test the plants, they had adequate levels. But yeah, when I looked  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:48):**  at the plant, it was showing deficiency symptoms. I mean, you could look at that and say, well,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:54):**  that's a zinc deficiency or that's a manganese deficiency, just obvious. But when I tested,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:34:59):**  it was fine. Why is that? And it's when I learned about this chelation issue and how it can be such  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:07):**  a problem. This is something that we've been monitoring and paying attention to for a number  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:12):**  of years. And we believe it seems that in some cases with SAP analysis, it reports those a bit  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:21):**  more accurately, but perhaps doesn't take all the chelation into account. But of course, it's still  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:27):**  extracting nutrients that are held within the plant SAP and it's still possible for them to be  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:32):**  chelated. So we do see the SAP analysis correlate more accurately to what the plants are actually  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:39):**  showing visually than... I would agree. I would agree. I think the SAP analysis has been a good  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:45):**  step forward. But until I kind of figured out this chelation effect, that's when it really gelled for  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:51):**  me and I could understand why I was seeing deficiency symptoms and what looked like on paper  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:35:58):**  to be an appropriately healthy plant. Yeah, got it. What do you believe to be true about modern  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:06):**  agriculture that many other people don't believe to be true? We've been talking about a number of  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:11):**  different things that you seem to have a very different framework and a very different model  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:17):**  of thinking about what is happening in soils and plants. And so I'm just trying to understand the  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:24):**  the fundamentals and the foundational principles behind that. What are the things that you believe  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:30):**  to be true that many other people don't believe to be true? I believe that the soil can grow  
**[0:36:38-0:36:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:38):**  an extremely healthy high yielding plant with minimal additions of inputs. That there's plenty  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:49):**  of minerals in the soil if you treat it properly. And I think you'd find most people would disagree  
**[0:36:56-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:36:56):**  with me with that. We have proven you have to put on fertilizers to get good yields. Wow. I'm going  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:04):**  to stick with that because I've proven it to myself that you can do that. So you're saying that  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:11):**  you can actually grow healthy high yielding crops without adding fertilizers? Yes. So how do you do  
**[0:37:18-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:18):**  that? How does that work? That's a complex question and a very complex answer. If that were real simple  
**[0:37:30-0:37:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:30):**  I'd have to charge you for this information. But you know it's creating the healthy  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:39):**  soil that allows the plant roots to go deep into the soil to extract the minerals that it needs.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:46):**  I mean it's a vast sea of minerals available and if you're starting to see suppression of crop yield  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:54):**  and then you add fertilizer and the yield comes back that's because you're only using the top  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:37:59):**  few inches if you will of the soil. The roots are not healthy enough to penetrate deeper  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:07):**  to actually mine the minerals that are there. I mean all of our soil is nothing but minerals.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:13):**  So this is something that I've talked about as well and the question that I often get is aren't  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:20):**  you going to deplete the soil of minerals if you're not adding fertilizers? Well my quick reply  
**[0:38:25-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:25):**  to that is always that's like trying to take all the salt out of the ocean. Wow. All right. Well  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:33):**  you can deplete it. You can deplete it in a rooting zone and I'll grant you that. But what you need to  
**[0:38:40-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:40):**  do is expand your ability to search a bigger rooting zone and you need to add mycorrhizae  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:49):**  into that equation because you want a really big rooting zone let the mycorrhizae work for you.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:38:56):**  Oh this I think this is a much bigger topic that we perhaps need to unwrap at some point in the  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:02):**  future but this is... I think you're right but it is an exciting one. It's a very exciting one the  
**[0:39:08-0:39:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:08):**  the idea that we can grow really healthy crops without constantly adding inputs. I mean when  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:15):**  when we talk about developing regenerative agriculture ecosystems today there's a lot of  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:20):**  discussion about sustainability and I've made the comment that we can't have a legitimate  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:26):**  conversation about sustainability and a sustainable agriculture as long as we are constantly importing  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:33):**  such large volumes of inputs that we first need to have a regenerative model where we regenerate  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:39):**  soil health and plant health to a much higher plateau of performance and only at that point can  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:44):**  we have a true conversation about sustainability. And so for me this is this is really exciting  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:49):**  because what you are describing is really the foundation of what I would describe as true  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:39:56):**  sustainability. That's correct. I'm going to circle back and I want to come back to that piece and  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:01):**  explore it a little bit more but I'd love to also ask the the counterpoint of the question that I  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:07):**  asked which brought out that answer which is what is it that you do not believe to be true that  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:12):**  many other people do believe to be true? Well as I think about that it's almost the same question in  
**[0:40:19-0:40:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:19):**  a sense that most people believe that you have to put a lot of inputs in in order to get a decent  
**[0:40:28-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:28):**  yield and they're not understanding how the system works. The way the system will work is not what  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:38):**  we're trying to do today. We're trying to, I don't know, we're trying to swim upstream with it and  
**[0:40:42-0:40:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:42):**  it's just not working. Yeah there certainly is I would agree with you that we are we're trying to  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:49):**  we're trying to force things to move in a direction that they don't naturally want to flow  
**[0:40:53-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:40:53):**  and when we get I mean we can talk about science the science behind developing exceptionally healthy  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:01):**  crops and we can make it sound really complicated but at the end of the day the reality is that it  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:06):**  was designed to work and it did work very successfully for a very long period of time  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:11):**  and if we can give it the framework and the management that it needs to really flow well  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:17):**  then it can work very effectively. We just need to allow that to happen. Yes I agree. What technology  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:24):**  or ideas what are you really excited about? What are you excited about in the future of agriculture?  
**[0:41:30-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:30):**  I think probably one of the big things is getting more involved in food production. We've done a  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:40):**  lot of work with our corn soybean game if you will and we've tried to make foods out of that  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:46):**  and then these foods are not necessarily very healthy for us and I think if we started  
**[0:41:53-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:41:53):**  concentrating on food production agriculture has a fantastic opportunity here. When we're wasting  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:02):**  some of the best soils on earth produce fuel for our vehicles we're really missing it. So just a  
**[0:42:11-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:11):**  moment ago you mentioned the word opportunity. So what where do you see the big  
**[0:42:17-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:17):**  opportunities in agriculture today? I see the most success right now in growers that are looking to  
**[0:42:27-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:27):**  improve sustainability of their farming operations and when they do that they're finding that they're  
**[0:42:36-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:36):**  they're relying on less and less inputs. They're having higher quality food and feed production  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:44):**  at a lower cost and they are profitable in a time when right now agriculture is struggling  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:51):**  in profitability right now. It really is but those growers are not struggling at all. So in your  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:42:57):**  assessment the opportunity for growers is really to develop sustainability and reduce inputs so  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:05):**  that they can become more profitable. Is that what you're saying? Yes. If you were to recommend to  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:11):**  growers to learn more about these various pieces that you are talking about what is the  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:17):**  one book that you would recommend the most often? What is one resource that you would recommend  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:22):**  most people and different growers to learn more about? Well a book that I really like is  
**[0:43:29-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:29):**  Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease that was edited by Lawrence Dattinoff, Wade Elmer, and  
**[0:43:36-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:36):**  Don Huber. I find that to be a really useful book in helping you understand how minerals affect  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:44):**  plants and when you get a feel for that and how that all works then all these things that you're  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:50):**  not talking about for the last hour all of a sudden start making a lot of sense. So that's a  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:43:55):**  pretty good book to start with. Yeah it certainly is one of the in terms of agronomic sciences and  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:01):**  so forth it's I would say it's in the top two or three that I personally reference the most often  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:07):**  so it definitely is a very valuable resource. And I think for people who haven't done anything  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:14):**  but that's a really a pretty decent one to start with and then once they sort of have that  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:19):**  under their belt then they can start delving into some of the books and I don't have a particular one  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:24):**  in mind to talk about the microbial life in the soil and what it takes to improve that.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:30):**  Now there's actually a... Because once you're doing the plants the rest of that sort of  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:36):**  it all falls into place for you. Yeah the plants are certainly the engine the photosynthetic engine  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:42):**  that drives soil biology for certain. There's a really great book that was written that was  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:47):**  published back in the 70s if I'm not mistaken by the Russian Academy of Sciences titled  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:44:54):**  Soil Microorganisms and Higher Plants by N.A. Krasilnikov and we actually have a PDF of that  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:01):**  that we make available on our website at Advancing Eco-Agriculture that is incredibly powerful  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:06):**  incredibly insightful reading. It's a fairly in-depth book but it's kind of amazing both  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:12):**  how much we have already learned back then 40 years ago and how much we have failed to put  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:18):**  into practice. There's a lot of knowledge there that we haven't applied consistently in commercial  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:24):**  scale production agriculture for sure. Michael what is the one action that you would advise that  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:31):**  all growers should take right now? They should take immediately. What's the one thing that people can  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:37):**  do to make the biggest difference on their aberrations? Stop poisoning the soil. I guess that  
**[0:45:43-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:43):**  was easy. Real simple just stop. So that sounds simple it sounds easy to do but how do you  
**[0:45:52-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:45:52):**  manage that if you're if you're it's a challenge to do if you spent most of your life doing that  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:00):**  stopping it is not necessarily easy. Are there the one action they need to do to be successful?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:07):**  Are there transition steps that can be taken to kind of move away from that? What are some of your  
**[0:46:13-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:13):**  growers doing that have moved away from using herbicides and so forth? I would say I have a full  
**[0:46:20-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:20):**  array of actions from taking baby steps to jumping off the cliff and just 100% stop and I have seen  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:30):**  growers from anywhere from the smaller three four hundred acre growers to the ten to fifteen thousand  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:37):**  acre growers step off the cliff and have it work really well for them. I was really concerned about  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:44):**  some of the larger growers but I found that they had they had the management ability and the  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:49):**  resources to really make it happen and once they understood what they were doing and why they were  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:46:55):**  doing it they could be very successful. So are you suggesting? I think that's something that most  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:00):**  people don't believe because I mean I get that thrown in my face almost every day well I can't  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:05):**  do that. I have too big an operation I can't do that and I just really enjoy throwing it back  
**[0:47:11-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:11):**  while I know somebody who asked and then they've not really changed they have not necessarily added  
**[0:47:18-0:47:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:18):**  more hired men or anything. The one thing that they have added is that if they make a mistake  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:24):**  or a failure they've had to employ a large number of people for a short period of time to hand weed  
**[0:47:31-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:31):**  a field. If they made a mistake that's the only fix there is. So this is actually yeah I'm  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:39):**  struggling with this a little bit myself is so when you say that when you use the words stepping  
**[0:47:45-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:45):**  off a cliff are you talking about eliminating 100% of all herbicide applications right out of the gate?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:51):**  What does that mean exactly? All pesticide applications. Aren't you going to lose your crop to  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:47:57):**  a potential disease and insect pests when you do that? When you do that you better have read that  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:02):**  book that I just suggested so that you understand that you have the right micronutrient balance  
**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:09):**  to keep that plant healthy enough to protect itself. So I and you can do that through  
**[0:48:15-0:48:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:15):**  you know starter fertilizers, foliar feeding, multiple foliar feedings and you can pull it off.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:22):**  So what have been some of the failures of growers who have tried to do this and what have been  
**[0:48:27-0:48:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:27):**  what has been their degree of success as well? By and large I've had all successes. I'm trying to  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:35):**  think of a failure. I really don't think of any but I make sure that they really understand and  
**[0:48:42-0:48:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:42):**  know what they're doing when they do it. I've had a few where they missed a field or two timing wise  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:49):**  you know a rain caught them and they didn't get in and get it taken care of when they should have  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:54):**  some weed issues that haunted them a little bit but they were able to get it cleaned up to the  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:48:59):**  point where it did not suppress yield. Wow. How do their yields compare? I think that their yields  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:06):**  have been going up. That's what's been somewhat shocking you know and I want to be sure that  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:10):**  that's attributed to that not just necessarily a good growing season because we've had some  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:16):**  good growing seasons recently but their yields have continued to climb quite quite rapidly. They've  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:23):**  moved to a different yield plateau. So you're saying that their yields are actually higher now  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:28):**  than they were when they were using herbicides and pesticides regularly? Yes. Well that's exciting  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:34):**  because that's exactly those are the same types of things that we've observed in the fruit and  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:38):**  vegetable production world and those are one of the types of regenerative systems that we  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:43):**  seek to create and to establish and I absolutely agree with you that those are possible. I think  
**[0:49:48-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:48):**  the one piece that we from a management perspective often do a bit differently on fruit and vegetable  
**[0:49:55-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:49:55):**  crops that we are working on is we don't usually advise people to step off the cliff to borrow your  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:03):**  terminology but rather to manage nutrition and to regenerate soil health to a higher plateau  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:09):**  of performance where we kind of earn the right to eliminate pesticides where all of a sudden  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:16):**  we don't have problems with powdery mildew anymore, we don't have problems with spider mites  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:20):**  anymore, we don't have problems with leaf hoppers anymore and so when we get to that much higher  
**[0:50:25-0:50:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:25):**  plateau performance and we no longer have the problems then we start cutting and eliminating  
**[0:50:31-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:31):**  pesticide applications. So it seems a bit scary to me when you're managing a crop that  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:38):**  is really valuable to suggest eliminating all pesticide applications immediately but obviously  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:45):**  you've been successful in doing so. Yes it's worked. It was really scary when we first started  
**[0:50:51-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:51):**  doing that and so that's why I've kind of learned the few things that you have to be sure that gets  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/disease-resistance-and-regenerating-soil-with-michael-mcneill/#t=0:50:59):**  accomplished and that's getting the soil as healthy as you can and the plants as healthy as you can

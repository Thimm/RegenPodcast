### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Thu, 17 Mar 2022 13:50:47)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast where we talk about the  
**[0:00:05-0:00:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:05):**  agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate soil health and  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:10):**  plant health and human health, livestock health, and of course on the pathway to achieving  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:15):**  all these outcomes, we also regenerate farm profitability as well.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:19):**  That's an important outcome.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:21):**  I've really been looking forward to the conversation for this episode with Kelly Mulville, currently  
**[0:00:26-0:00:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:26):**  from California, and Kelly is the leader, as far as I'm aware, in figuring out how to  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:36):**  do a really good job of integrating livestock into perennial production systems.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:42):**  And I think what he's been working on transfers to more than just grapes, but also to trees  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:49):**  and orchard systems and so forth.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:50):**  And there's a tremendous need for his type of innovation and thinking.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:54):**  So Kelly, thank you very much for being here and for agreeing to share some of what you've  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:00:59):**  been working on.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:00):**  Can you tell us a little bit about your background and story and what has brought you here and  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:05):**  the scope of what you're working on today?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:08):**  Sure.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:09):**  Thanks for having me, John.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:10):**  I really appreciate this.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:13):**  I grew up in far West Texas, El Paso, Texas, and my dad was an architect who grew up in  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:22):**  a blacksmith slash machine shop.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:24):**  And so he still had an interest in agriculture and the plot of land that we built our house.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:31):**  We also had a small market garden on.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:34):**  And so I was very interested in that.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:38):**  One of the things that really changed my direction in my life is that I got interested in falconry  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:43):**  as a really young kid.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:46):**  And I'm not sure where that came from, but by the age of 11, I was raising a hawk.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:51):**  And that experience really connected me to the natural world.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:01:57):**  And at that point I knew that raptors were in decline and I had decided I wanted to go  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:02):**  into captive breeding of raptors.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:05):**  Shortly after I had raised that hawk and released it, I read Silent Spring.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:10):**  My mom checked it out of the library for me.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:12):**  And I only half jokingly say that I've been devastated ever since then.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:17):**  And I realized that if I went into captive breeding of raptors, there would obviously  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:23):**  be benefits to that, but it wasn't addressing the cause of the problem.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:27):**  And the cause of the problem was agriculture.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:29):**  And the little market farm that we were running was not being run organically.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:34):**  I did find a book on organic agriculture in my parents' bookshelf.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:38):**  I read that and told my dad I wanted to take over that market farm and do it organically.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:44):**  And he was thrilled that I wanted to take it over.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:47):**  So that started my journey.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:50):**  And this is probably in the late 70s.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:55):**  What age were you when you assumed the responsibility for the market garden?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:02:59):**  Probably about, I don't know, 16 years old or so.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:04):**  And so I continued farming.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:09):**  It expanded a bit and I was selling to the first food co-op in El Paso, Texas.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:15):**  And then I had a big crop failure one year and realized that I did not know everything  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:20):**  I needed to know.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:22):**  And so I ended up through a friend's recommendation coming out to California and going through  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:28):**  the apprenticeship in ecological horticulture at UC Santa Cruz, which at that time was one  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:34):**  of the only places you could really study organic agriculture in a practical sense.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:41):**  And so I came out and did that program and after that I ended up back in the West and  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:50):**  on a ranch actually at 9,000 feet.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:54):**  And it was there that I found out about the work of Alan Savory.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:03:58):**  Through that, the article I read, I ended up writing my bike down to meet Alan Savory,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:05):**  which took about five days.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:08):**  I got snowed out twice and introduced myself to him and told him that after reading what  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:14):**  he was doing, I realized that is what I wanted to learn because it was a practical approach  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:19):**  to basically ecosystem restoration.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:22):**  And by the looks of my transportation, apparently he gave me a scholarship to attend the first  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:27):**  course.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:29):**  And so I went on to work with a number of really inspirational and innovative ranchers  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:38):**  throughout the West and talked Alan into putting together a degree program actually so I can  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:45):**  deep dive into holistic management.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:49):**  And so since then, I've basically been bouncing around between crop farming and livestock  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:54):**  farming.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:04:56):**  And I realized later in life, two things, I went to a wine tasting and realized that  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:01):**  there was some really good wine out there and that the horticulture, the practice of  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:07):**  growing grapes was pretty fascinating, especially to a guy who really loved growing chilies,  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:11):**  which are so expressive of their site and climate.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:15):**  And so once I started getting into that realm, realized that there's probably great opportunities  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:20):**  to integrate these two ideas of livestock in cropping systems.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:28):**  And so that's what led me to kind of where I'm at now.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:33):**  So where are you at right now and what is the work that you're doing right now?  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:37):**  You're really, you've made lots of, developed lots of innovations in incorporating livestock  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:43):**  into horticultural crops.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:46):**  Tell us a little bit about what you're doing.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:47):**  I find it very intriguing.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:49):**  When I came out to California to start managing some vineyards, the first vineyard I actually  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:54):**  put in was in Southeast Arizona in a very remote area.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:05:59):**  And I did not know anything about putting in a vineyard.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:02):**  Fortunately, I had a friend nearby whose family had put in one of the first vineyards in Arizona.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:09):**  And I kind of winged that and got a vineyard established.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:12):**  It was in one of the most biodiverse spots in the lower 48.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:17):**  And so we had some particular challenges, but that was pretty thrilling to me to be  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:21):**  working with in the context of that amount of biodiversity.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:26):**  After establishing that vineyard, I went on to California and had managed a couple of  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:33):**  vineyards and in all of those vineyards in California, with the very first one that I  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:37):**  started at, I started integrating sheep in those.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:41):**  And one of the first things that I, one of the early things that I realized was that  
**[0:06:45-0:06:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:45):**  because of the climate in California and Arizona as well, that grazing sheep in vineyards is  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:54):**  not an uncommon thing.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:55):**  I think perhaps it's been done since there were vineyards.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:06:59):**  But because sheep are really fond of grapevines, in fact, I've used sheep to take out a vineyard,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:07):**  but the sheep are so fond of grapevines that you don't really want them in the vineyard  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:12):**  during the growing season of the vines.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:15):**  But if you look at the weather and the growing season in either California or the Southwest  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:22):**  United States, the time when you get your rains and get things like a cover crop or  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:29):**  vegetation on the vineyard floor are oftentimes peak when the vines are leafed out.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:36):**  And so therefore the common practice is to graze only during the growing season of the,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:43):**  or not during the growing season of the vines.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:45):**  So you need to have your sheep out of there.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:47):**  And I realized that was a huge missed opportunity from the perspective of solar energy.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:54):**  And so all of that solar energy captured into those green plants, if you take that and then  
**[0:07:59-0:08:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:07:59):**  subsequently mow that or disc it, or it's often and doing both of those, or use herbicides,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:08):**  depending on what type of management you're doing, then you've lost a lot of potential.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:14):**  And so I was really intrigued by how do we create a system that allows the integration  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:19):**  of livestock throughout the growing season of the vines.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:25):**  And I initially experimented with an offset system.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:30):**  So this is just an electric offset system.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:32):**  Those of us who have been involved in holistic management or planned grazing are generally  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:37):**  pretty familiar with electric fence.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:39):**  And my thinking was that it would probably be fairly simple to devise an offset system  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:45):**  to train to keep the sheep from eating the vines.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:49):**  So one of the vineyards I was managing in California was very small.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:53):**  It was a perfect trial site and that it was a small section taken out of a larger conventionally  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:08:59):**  managed vineyard.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:00):**  And so I set up this offset system with the permission of the owner and trialed that for  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:08):**  a year.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:10):**  It was just a year long trial.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:13):**  And I did that.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:15):**  I used basically a grazing plan in that.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:18):**  It was somewhat more of a rotation being a very small system.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:22):**  It didn't really require doing an extensive grazing plan and allowed our adequate recovery  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:27):**  between the grazing.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:30):**  And at the end of that time, when I finally took the sheep out, it was completely successful  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:36):**  in doing those things that I wanted it to do.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:39):**  It allowed the sheep to do all of the suckering of the vines.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:42):**  It allowed them to do all the shoot tipping and it controlled all the vegetation on the  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:47):**  floor.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:49):**  The thing that was really exciting about that was at the end of it, I started compiling  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:56):**  information on what happened.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:09:58):**  And we found out that during that summer we had achieved a 90% reduction in irrigation  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:07):**  use compared to the control site.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:11):**  And simultaneous, we had a little over 1200 pound increase in yield.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:19):**  And again, this is not a scientific, I'm not trying to say this is a scientific research  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:23):**  project.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:24):**  This was an on-farm trial.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:26):**  The previous two years, it was managed with sheep only during the dormant season of the  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:30):**  vines.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:32):**  And so the water saving compared to those two years was 80%.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:35):**  A couple of years later, I called up the winemaker who also at that time was teaching winemaking  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:41):**  at Napa Community College.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:44):**  And we had discussed during the trial of having the sheep in there for the extended season  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:51):**  that what might happen to the wine potentially from that?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:10:55):**  Is it going to taste like wool or sheep pee or something?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:00):**  And so a few years later, I'd remember that conversation.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:03):**  I called up George and I said, if you still have some of that wine, do a blind tasting  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:11):**  so that you set it out and taste and just see what year you think is the best.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:17):**  And I've already done the same and I want to see what you come up with.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:20):**  And so for me, it had been that last year when we did that trial.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:23):**  And he said the exact same thing.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:25):**  He said, well, that year really came out good.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:28):**  And so we discussed what had come out of that and what I learned from going back on my notes.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:35):**  And he encouraged me to write an article on that.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:38):**  I did.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:39):**  I put together an article.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:40):**  I submitted it to every viticulture magazine in this country.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:43):**  It was rejected by every one of those.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:45):**  It was put into Acres and Stockman Grass Farmer.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:49):**  And Australia and New Zealand grape brewer winemaker put it in their next issue.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:11:54):**  And so consequently, after that got published in Australia and New Zealand, there was a  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:02):**  pretty good interest there.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:03):**  Well, a lot more interest than there was in this country.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:07):**  And I had asked the woman who was the editor of Australia and New Zealand grape brewer  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:10):**  winemaker why that might be.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:12):**  And she just said, climate change is affecting us probably more severely than a lot of places.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:18):**  And if you guys have been dealing with 25 years of drought and fires, then you would  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:22):**  probably be paying more attention to approaches like this.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:25):**  And she said, and that makes total sense.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:29):**  It's not coming across as wacky to me.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:32):**  And I think there'll be a lot of receptivity.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:35):**  And so that was definitely true.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:37):**  I ended up being invited down to both Australia and New Zealand to do presentations.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:41):**  And the first vineyard to adopt that offset system that I developed is in Australia.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:51):**  And they've been using that now probably for about nine years, very successfully.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:12:57):**  So that's been ramped up to a commercial scale now.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:00):**  But after that, I was invited to do a presentation at EcoFarm, which is a conference on the West  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:09):**  Coast here.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:10):**  And at that conference, the owner of this ranch, Sally Calhoun, was there.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:17):**  And she came to my presentation.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:19):**  And she was interested in potentially planting grapes on this ranch.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:25):**  And the history of this ranch is that there were years ago, there were 1000 acres of wine  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:31):**  grapes on this ranch.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:32):**  And that was part of Almond Inn vineyards, which was a total of 6000 acres, which was  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:37):**  the largest wine grape vineyard in this country and one of the largest in the world.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:41):**  And so this ranch had a history of wine grapes here.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:45):**  And some of the oldest vineyards in California are in this neighborhood.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:50):**  So there's definitely a history here.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:52):**  And she just thought that it might be a good idea to diversify the ranch.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:13:57):**  The ranch is 7600 acres in total.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:00):**  And most of that is rangeland.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:03):**  And there is probably about 800 acres or so of irrigated cropland.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:08):**  So Sally came to that presentation.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:11):**  At the end of that, I talked about what I'd done with my trial in California, what the  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:16):**  grower in Australia was doing.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:18):**  And I said, so what I'm doing is modifying a system that was actually never designed  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:22):**  to be grazed.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:24):**  And what if we take a bigger picture approach and design our agricultural systems to more  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:31):**  closely mimic natural systems and design them for ease of management and to be economically  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:37):**  viable because it's kind of like trying to convert like a Ford Pinto into being an all  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:45):**  terrain vehicle or something.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:46):**  It's just like, why not start from the get go?  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:49):**  That's definitely an influence from growing up with an architect who designed everything.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:14:56):**  And so after that presentation, Sally came up to me and said, you have to come out to  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:02):**  the ranch.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:03):**  I'm really intrigued by this idea.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:04):**  And in fact, I think that I probably can't do anything else but what you're talking about.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:11):**  And so I came out, looked at the ranch and we talked back and forth for probably a year  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:18):**  or so.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:22):**  And I wasn't initially planning on coming out, but Sally talked my wife and I into moving  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:26):**  out here and establishing this vineyard.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:29):**  And so that was in 2000 that I first came out here and we planted the vineyard in 2017.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:39):**  We got our first crop last year.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:42):**  So we're just now getting into production.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:46):**  So what does a vineyard look like when you design it from the beginning to incorporate  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:52):**  livestock?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:54):**  So there's probably a number of ways to do this.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:15:59):**  And like if you're really designing to incorporate livestock and respect and the ecosystem that  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:09):**  you're in or the environment that you're in, it's probably going to look different in wherever  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:14):**  you are.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:15):**  I'm also thinking of your background in holistic management and the way that you've learned  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:20):**  to so deeply consider the landscape and the overall ecosystem.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:24):**  I wonder, did you ever identify a list of the number of factors that you considered  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:28):**  in your planning?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:29):**  I'm sure there were a multitude.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:32):**  There are.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:34):**  I had two pages of just basically bullet points of all these things I wanted to consider.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:40):**  And so, and this is a fascinating thing.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:43):**  I think the total vineyard right now is only 25 acres.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:47):**  We planted half of that the first round knowing, and this is, by the way, Sally, both Sally  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:53):**  Calhoun and her husband, Matt Cristiano are both engineers.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:16:58):**  And so I really appreciate the perspective of that and thinking that we're going to learn  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:06):**  a lot.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:07):**  Even though it's a small sector, we're going to learn a lot in that.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:09):**  So let's save the second planting so that we can take those learnings to improve that.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:15):**  And so that was definitely true.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:18):**  And the simple answer to your question for this climate and this site, the way we ended  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:25):**  up designing that is we trained the vines up high enough so that the sheep cannot reach  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:31):**  the parts that are critical, but they can reach the parts that allow them to do a lot  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:38):**  of the work that is normally done by hand or machine.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:42):**  And so we're designing so that the sheep can do fully what sheep do.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:50):**  And then there's other factors that come in there like you mentioned.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:52):**  So for instance, we were definitely seeing the effects of climate change here.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:17:57):**  Things are getting warmer, but things are also variable.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:02):**  The site that we planted in, the guy who had been at this ranch the longest when I started  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:06):**  here was an older man from Mexico.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:09):**  And I asked him, I selected a hillside and I said, well, would we ever have frost problems  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:14):**  here?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:15):**  And he said, no, never.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:16):**  Not in my experience.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:17):**  You would not have a frost problem here.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:19):**  Last year we had three frosts in May.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:21):**  The last one was May 20th.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:24):**  Everything was leafed out May 20th.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:29):**  So this is just a side benefit that we weren't necessarily planning on, but we had considered  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:34):**  that it could be a possibility.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:36):**  So when we raised the vines up and the cordon wire, the wire that the cane is on that produces  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:43):**  the fruit is somewhere between 66 and 68 inches high.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:50):**  So the vine is less susceptible to frost by being that high.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:18:56):**  And that's also going to be probably on average maybe a couple degrees cooler.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:05):**  And it also, I mean, there's a lot of benefits that are coming out of this.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:09):**  Another one is that you're shading because it is an overhead, partial overhead system.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:14):**  You're shading the ground below, which in turn is providing shade for your animals,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:18):**  which is really important in a hot climate.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:22):**  And all of that allows for a lot of reduction in what could potentially be fossil fuels  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:31):**  or heavy equipment and a cycling of those nutrients right on the site.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:38):**  There's so many directions we could go with this conversation.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:40):**  I want to get into how you've been managing plants underneath the grapes and then to the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:45):**  grape management as well.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:47):**  But let's talk about the reduced tractor passes and reduced tillage a little bit.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:52):**  I mean, how many, just what I can glimpse into your system, if you have a perennial  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:19:58):**  soil cover being grazed by sheep and your sheep are doing your summer pruning and your  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:04):**  suckering, you've just had a significant reduction in labor.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:08):**  You've had a significant reduction in tractor passes and in fuel consumption.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:12):**  What has that looked like for you?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:15):**  So for us, because we started with this design, that's just the normal for us.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:23):**  But then back and look at where I did that trial and look at say, compare this to a traditional  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:28):**  organic vineyard in California.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:32):**  The average number of tractor passes I would say in a vineyard like that would be about  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:36):**  25 per row per year.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:39):**  It's going to vary depending on who's farming that.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:43):**  The number of tractor passes we had last year was probably about 10.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:53):**  And all of those were for our sprays.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:20:57):**  Actually, I should say somewhere between seven and 10 passes that we had with the tractor.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:03):**  And of course, if those were only for sprays and perhaps a bit for harvest as well, but  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:07):**  you have, that means you have no tractor passes for tillage.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:11):**  And that has a tremendous impact on fuel consumption also.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:16):**  The estimate that I did when I did that trial in California, and again, this is 2000, I  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:22):**  believe it was 2010.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:25):**  The savings per acre from outside inputs, from labor, from fuel, from tractor use was  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:33):**  $500 per acre.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:36):**  I'm actually surprised it isn't more.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:38):**  And actually I've had a number of people tell me that I was underestimating that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:42):**  I never had anybody tell me I was overestimating that.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah, it sounds low.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:48):**  And when you think about that, in this region here, there's many vineyards that are a thousand  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:54):**  acres or more.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:21:56):**  And if you think about transposing that kind of savings per year, that's a $500,000 savings.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:04):**  So that's not minor.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:08):**  So there's this reduction in these types of input expenses.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:14):**  And you also, I don't know if you included fertility costs in that, but with livestock  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:18):**  and nutrient cycling, you have to reduce fertilizer applications as well.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:21):**  But I'm curious about what the other side of the ledger looks like also.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:25):**  What have you, and I know you just had your first harvest with this design system, so  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:29):**  you don't yet have history to go from or a lot of history, but what are you anticipating  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:33):**  and what are you observing with your experiences so far in terms of increased yields and overall  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:38):**  crop performance and climactic resilience?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:42):**  So the first thing that we've noticed is that it's kind of an aesthetic thing.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:48):**  It's a really beautiful system.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:51):**  It is linear because it's a vineyard, but because it's trained high, you have access  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:56):**  in both directions.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:22:58):**  So practically speaking, it's open.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:03):**  And so that makes a big difference for both humans working in there because you can cut  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:07):**  across and go back and forth through there freely.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:11):**  And at the initial development stage, when we can't graze because the vines aren't tall  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:15):**  enough so that the sheep would graze them, when we can't graze during the grain season  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:18):**  of the vines, we do use a mower and that mower is on a quad.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:24):**  And because again, we're doing everything we can to reduce tractor passes and tillage,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:28):**  so we're going smaller there.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:30):**  And that allows us, we could potentially go either direction with that mower.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:35):**  Other things that are happening with that is that, and looking at this system as a whole,  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:42):**  one of the big goals for me is how do we increase biodiversity in our agricultural systems?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:48):**  Agriculture in general, the first thing, when you're developing a farm, the first thing  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:53):**  you're doing is simplifying the ecosystem.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:55):**  You're clearing land, you're clearing soil.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:23:59):**  And so the ecosystem gets reduced greatly, the biodiversity of that.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:04):**  And my hope and my thinking and my vision for this is that we actually restore the ecosystem  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:11):**  health.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:12):**  I've joked saying that actually this is just an ecosystem restoration project that is producing  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:17):**  really good wine.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:18):**  And so in order to do that, we are monitoring pretty closely things that are happening there.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:24):**  So we're monitoring our soils.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:26):**  Before we planted anything, we dug six foot deep soil pits on various parts of this vineyard  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:31):**  and potential other sites.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:34):**  So we're monitoring soil, we're monitoring soil biology, we're monitoring bird populations,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:40):**  we're monitoring insect populations, which we just got our first results from insects,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:44):**  and then we'll be monitoring fruit quality as well.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:47):**  So it's one thing to say, yeah, everything is better than it was before.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:52):**  This way we actually have something to look at and see what is actually occurring.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:24:58):**  And one of the most exciting aspects of this has been we've had a botanist come from the  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:04):**  neighboring national park to help us with identifying plants and we're at getting close  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:08):**  to 50 species of plants that are growing in the vineyard.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:11):**  And we have some birding friends, including a guy who's a PhD wildlife biologist who specializes  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:19):**  in birch.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:20):**  And I asked him to go do a pass through the vineyard.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:26):**  And he said, well, vineyards are usually not too exciting.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:29):**  And I said, I realized that, but just go in there and see what you're seeing.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:34):**  And he came back after, I think he was out there for four hours and he said, you need  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:38):**  to tell me again what you're doing out here, because there are things that should not be  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:43):**  out here and lots of them.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:46):**  And the last time he went into the vineyard was just probably, it was in the fall and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:52):**  he just said, it was, again, it's just amazing.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:54):**  The birds are thick, you have great species diversity and species and numbers.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:25:59):**  And so all of those things are occurring.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:03):**  And I think that we're just getting warmed up.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:06):**  And so I think back to your original question of what is happening with fruit and yields,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:14):**  we are not sure yet, but so the first wine that will be bottled from this vineyard, that  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:24):**  bottling will be happening probably sometime in the next few months.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:28):**  And I have had a chance to barrel taste it.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:30):**  And I don't think that I'm a good judge to say, oh, it's the best wine I've ever had.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:36):**  But I was really happy with the quality of the wine and the expression of it.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:41):**  And I do know that the winemaker that's making the wine was pretty thrilled with it as well.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:46):**  So we still have a ways to go to get it bottled and see what's happening.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:49):**  And again, it's just the first bottling.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:51):**  And that's only three varieties of what will be probably a total of around 20 different  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:26:58):**  varieties that we're growing here.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:01):**  You know, Kelly, I really appreciate the way you answered my question.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:05):**  I asked you a question of what does the other side of the ledger look like?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:10):**  And you deliberately went to regenerating ecology and what you're observing there rather  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:16):**  than dollars and cents.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:19):**  Because of a desire to produce change, often when I'm having conversations with growers,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:23):**  I want to illustrate the dollars and cents to illustrate that these regenerative ecosystems  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:30):**  are actually more profitable and folks can make more money than what they're doing currently.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:35):**  And so that has become a bit of a frame of reference where I go there frequently and  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:40):**  I completely lost sight of, in this conversation of what you just described, of all the amazing  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:45):**  benefits that are happening in the ecosystem.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:47):**  So thanks for the reroute.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:49):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:50):**  I was about to apologize for you that, but I really appreciate that you caught that as  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:55):**  well.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:27:56):**  And, but I think that the back to the economic benefits, the things that we're going to see.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:02):**  So there's a couple of things about this design that are, obviously there's a number of things  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:06):**  that are different from say a normal vineyard in California, which would be a vertically  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:11):**  shoot positioned trellis system.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:14):**  In other words, the vines are trained up almost in a curtain like fashion.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:19):**  So the cord on wire is usually much lower than we have it.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:23):**  So say maybe somewhere between three and four feet.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:26):**  And then you have this curtain of vines that are kept kind of tight in this narrow hedge.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:32):**  And that's the conventional trellis that's used.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:37):**  The spacing on that is generally much closer than what we're using.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:41):**  Our spacing is 12 feet apart in rows.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:44):**  I would say the average is going to be somewhere between five and eight feet of spacing.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:53):**  And we're going to have a little, actually we don't have more wire on our trellis system  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:58):**  because we don't have catch wires.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:28:59):**  We may even have a little bit less wire, but it is taller.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:03):**  So the posts are taller, but our spacing between vines is also more, we have a six foot spacing  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:10):**  between vines.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:12):**  That gives us 72 square feet per vine.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:15):**  And my hope is that during a normal rainfall year here, which is hard, or maybe I should  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:24):**  say an average rainfall year, historically average rainfall in this area is 12 inches.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:29):**  Most of that will occur between January and April.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:32):**  There are people who have dry farmed in this area.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:36):**  A lot of those places I'm seeing drip on now.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:40):**  And we've, I think in the seven years that I've been here, we've had one year that had  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:44):**  more than 12 inches.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:46):**  And the remaining years have been less than that.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:49):**  But we have increased our water holding capacity in the soil.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:54):**  And before I go into that, I'll just back up and say the average dry farming in this  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:29:59):**  state generally has probably closer to a hundred square feet per vine.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:04):**  And that is managed using the dust mulch.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:07):**  So there's pretty extensive disking in there.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:09):**  And I don't think with your audience here, I have to go into what continuous disking  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:15):**  would do to soil.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:17):**  But anyway, I think that one of the benefits of this, again, economically is that we will  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:21):**  be able to reduce our water irrigation use and potentially be able to do dry farming  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:27):**  depending on what happens with the climate.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:30):**  Our increase in soil organic matter on the site has been approximately 1%.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:40):**  And we achieved that before getting a harvest.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:44):**  So I want to make sure I'm understanding correctly.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:48):**  You're at 72 square feet per plant versus the industry standard of a hundred, if I understood  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:53):**  correctly.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:54):**  So you actually have a tighter plant spacing?  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:30:55):**  No, we do have a tighter plant spacing for historic dry farming practices.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:02):**  Got it.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:04):**  For the normal vineyard practices, that spacing would probably be anywhere from say an eight  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:10):**  foot by five foot spacing to a six foot by four foot spacing.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:16):**  And one of my concerns, and I should say that the trellis system that we're using is not  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:21):**  one that we designed.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:23):**  I had been, once I came in on this project, my initial plan was to use a complete overhead  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:29):**  trellis system.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:31):**  And as I was kind of researching what the options might be, I came across a trellis  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:36):**  system that was developed by a retired petroleum engineer in Texas.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:41):**  And I saw a friend of mine who's a viticulture consultant in Texas show a slide on that.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:49):**  And I called him up and I said, hey, that system, which is known as the Watson system,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:54):**  that looks like it'd be a really good system to graze under.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:31:57):**  And he said, possibly so, but I know nobody who's grazing under that.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:02):**  And mainly people are using it because growing grapes in places like Southern Texas, you  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:08):**  have high humidity and high mildew and fungal pressures.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:13):**  And so it's partly for that to get it up off the ground and get better air circulation.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:17):**  So one of my concerns was because we have such wide world spacing that we would have  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:22):**  a reduction in yield.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:24):**  But I don't think that is going to be the case in part because the way the vine is divided  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:31):**  in the system, you actually keep more growing canes than you would in a conventional VSP  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:39):**  system taking up the same footprint.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:41):**  So we harvested approximately four tons per acre this year.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:47):**  And none of those vines were fully developed.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:52):**  I'm not surprised to hear you say that because when we think about, I think in the future,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:32:57):**  instead of thinking about productivity per square foot of soil or per acre of land, we  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:03):**  really need to begin thinking about productivity per gallon of water use, particularly in California.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:10):**  And these dry land systems, I mean, we have so many examples of different types of management  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:16):**  systems in different environments, like the system of root intensification that was popularized  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:21):**  by Dr. Norman Hucoth at Cornell and Bob Quinn's work in Montana, where they all recognize  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:27):**  that a wider plant spacing in a well-managed ecosystem actually allows larger root systems  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:32):**  to develop and allows the plants to collect more sunlight.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:35):**  And you don't get a reduction in yield.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:37):**  In fact, in many cases, you go in the opposite direction and you actually get an increase  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:41):**  in yield with a smaller plant population.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:43):**  Yes.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:44):**  And that was definitely part of our thinking is that exactly what you described would occur.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:50):**  And also that we have two crops.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:54):**  We have the crop of our sheep that are in there and we have the grapevines.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:33:59):**  And so we are designing for both of those revenue streams.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:05):**  My one challenge in this conversation is I have every time that you start speaking about  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:11):**  something, I come up with more questions.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:14):**  More questions to ask than I think I can squeeze in.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:17):**  So I'd like to go in a number of directions here.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:20):**  At some point, I want to come back to learning more about your insect populations and a few  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:24):**  other questions on labor costs for harvest.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:27):**  But at this point, we haven't really talked about the sheep.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:31):**  How are you managing the sheep?  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:33):**  And perhaps more importantly, what are the sheep doing for you in terms of grapevine  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:39):**  management and in the overall ecosystem?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:43):**  This is a really exciting part of this.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:46):**  And it's interesting because when I was younger and looking at ecosystem degradation, I became  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:53):**  a vegetarian.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:54):**  It didn't last very long because I was doing that while I was on a friend of mine's ranch.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:34:59):**  And after studying with Alan Savory, I again realized that what I was after was not taking  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:05):**  something off the landscape.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:08):**  What I wanted to see in the world was ecosystems improving, ecosystem health improving, biodiversity  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:14):**  improving.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:15):**  And as although Leopold said years ago, that we may very well use the same tools that are  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:21):**  degrading our ecosystems to improve them.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:24):**  And so in this case, sheep seem particularly suited to a vineyard.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:31):**  And they, in part because of their size, but also in part because of their manure.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:38):**  And well, their manure and urine.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:40):**  And one of the things that I've realized is that, for instance, when we make compost,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:44):**  we often are not able to include the urine of the animal in that.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:52):**  And I really think that the urine plays a key role in getting that urine in something  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:35:58):**  like a vineyard or an orchard during the growing season of the plant.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:02):**  And I think that potentially contributed a little bit to that increase or decrease in water use  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:08):**  by having the animals in there during the growing season.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:12):**  As far as management, the cattle fit in the design of many vineyards as they are already.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:23):**  And so that's beneficial.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:25):**  I do know a few people who will let cattle go into a vineyard for a fairly short time.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:30):**  I tried putting cattle in a vineyard before I even planted it and it was a disaster.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:37):**  But I definitely wouldn't preclude that possibility.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:42):**  But so some of the things we've talked about, the sheep can do the suckering for you.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:49):**  And the sheep can do the shoot tipping for you as well.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:52):**  And they have done both of those things.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:54):**  And what I would refer to as basically a kind of a more conventional vineyard that's in  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:36:59):**  California when I did that trial.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:01):**  So one of the things and I learned this initially from reading Andrew Voisin who has an influence  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:10):**  on own savory.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:12):**  And he talked about the role that animals play in reducing insect pests by grazing a  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:18):**  plant.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:19):**  And if I'm remembering correctly, he was talking about a grass crop and that the graze trial  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:27):**  had no leafhopper problems and the trial that was mowed had serious leafhopper problems.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:35):**  And so he deduced that the main difference there was the effect of the animal on that  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:41):**  plant.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:43):**  And if we think about plants and herbivores and those evolving together and the fact that  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:50):**  if a plant wanted to discourage something from grazing, that they've developed all kinds  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:37:55):**  of mechanisms for that, thorns, toxins, and being unpalatable.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:01):**  And so a plant that allows itself to be grazed like a grapevine is doing, there's probably  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:08):**  going to be some kind of benefit that comes from that.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:10):**  And so we are just getting into this right now.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:15):**  But one of the things that seems to be happening is that we have very little insect problems  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:25):**  in the vineyard.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:26):**  And leafhoppers, by the way, can be a problem in vineyards as well.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:30):**  So we're not seeing mites, we're not seeing leafhoppers.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:35):**  And I think, and also by the way, last year we didn't use any fungal sprays on the vines  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:45):**  that we harvested fruit off of.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:47):**  We did, I did, and we are certified organic.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:51):**  But as much as possible, even certified organic fungicides can be pretty hard on beneficial  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:56):**  insects.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:38:57):**  And those would be sulfur, the main two would be sulfur and oil.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:01):**  And so we are pretty happy that because of our cultural practices and probably the trellis  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:09):**  system and possibly some effect from the presence of animals in there, that we're getting reduced  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:17):**  insect and disease pressure.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:19):**  We're doing foliar sprays that were inspired by your company's work.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:26):**  And so we are doing SAP analysis and we are basing those foliar sprays.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:31):**  And it's really fascinating to see, we basically are not hauling any fertilizer into the vineyard.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:40):**  The one exception to that was gypsum.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:42):**  We have a calcium deficiency at the soil surface and we have excess calcium below, which I  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:48):**  think is from historic farming practices here.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:39:53):**  So we are seeing, and then I think especially a lot of your listeners are aware of the role  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:01):**  of bricks in plant health and the lowest bricks we tested in our grapevines, this is not the  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:07):**  fruit, this is in the grapevines themselves.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:09):**  The lowest bricks we tested was 13.5.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:12):**  Wow, that's amazing.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:15):**  The highest bricks we got, and this was the highest bricks we got was in an area where  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:18):**  the sheep were actively browsing, was 22.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:23):**  That's intriguing.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:25):**  We didn't even pick grapes at 22 bricks.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:28):**  So there's something going on there.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:32):**  And again, we're just scratching the surface of this.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:36):**  You know, it's so intriguing.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:38):**  Your commentary on Andre Voisin's work on grazing versus mowing and insect susceptibility.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:46):**  So there's this research that indicates that when you have, you actually require a very  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:40:55):**  small amount, an early infestation of some herbivorous insects, like larval insects or  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:02):**  aphids or whatever the case might be, early on in the growing season.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:07):**  And this triggers a plant immune response, like plants respond to the presence of these  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:12):**  insects by sending out signals to attract predatory insects.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:17):**  And it changes the plant's internal chemistry as well to where they become much more resistant  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:23):**  to insects later on in the growing season, that you can actually produce a great, a very  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:27):**  strong resistance mechanism by having a small amount of, you could almost call them inoculum,  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:33):**  herbivorous insects at the beginning of the season.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:36):**  And based on what you're describing, I am wondering whether grazing by livestock might  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:42):**  produce a similar effect where it changes the plant's expression and produces higher  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:48):**  concentrations of compounds to reduce herbivorous activity later on during the growing season.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:54):**  I think that's completely possible.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:41:57):**  Just as you're building up all these questions, we get all these questions as we're working  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:00):**  along.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:01):**  There's so many research projects here.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:04):**  We actually have a person on staff who's spending a lot of his time managing research projects  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:09):**  here.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:11):**  And I think it comes back to that when you're getting unanticipated benefits, you're on  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:18):**  the right track as opposed to getting unexpected negative consequences.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:26):**  So I feel like we're on the right track, but we have so much more to learn.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:33):**  And it's just, it's exciting that we're seeing these results already.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:39):**  Well I'm really excited that you are actually observing or attempting to observe and measure  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:44):**  many of the ecosystem and ecological changes that are happening with bird populations and  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:48):**  with insect populations.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:49):**  You know, when we think about insect populations and insect management, the kind of the contemporary  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:42:57):**  framework that is commonly used to have these conversations is a framework of IPM and identifying  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:05):**  the economic threshold at which an insect becomes a quote unquote pest.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:12):**  And I believe that this discussion or this framework is incomplete and that we are not  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:20):**  considering the population thresholds of the beneficials of the predatory insects on the  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:27):**  insects, which might potentially become problematic.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:31):**  And we really have to consider these population dynamics.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:33):**  And so, because these are commonly not measured or not considered, we actually have a very  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:38):**  incomplete point of view on IPM from my perspective.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:43):**  And so I'm really curious about what you have observed.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:46):**  You know, what is it, something in the high 90th percentile of insect species are actually  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:52):**  beneficial or not harmful, I guess I could say.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:43:56):**  So what have you been able to observe so far with your insect populations?  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:03):**  One of the first things, and I guess technically spiders are not an insect, but we have huge  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:08):**  populations of spiders.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:10):**  And I've noticed this for a couple of years and John Lundgren was out visiting us recently.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:17):**  And he told us that he considers that a really good indicator of the healthy ecosystem to  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:23):**  have a high spider population.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:26):**  So we have had some sticky traps out, but as probably even trying to identify insects  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:33):**  is definitely a chore.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:35):**  And we have struggled with how do we interpret what we are seeing?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:40):**  And so what we ended up doing was finding a recent PhD entomologist graduate from UC  
**[0:44:47-0:44:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:47):**  Santa Cruz and asked him to develop a way to monitor insects for practical farmers.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:44:59):**  And we wanted him to do this trial, this insect monitoring, both here and at some of the neighboring  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:06):**  vineyards.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:07):**  And I believe we just had one neighboring vineyard that participated in this.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:13):**  It may have been two, and they're managing differently than us.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:18):**  They're more conventional.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:20):**  And so we are just in the early part of this.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:23):**  Just last week, we had a presentation from Andy, the man who's been doing this research.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:31):**  And what he was able to provide us was the cup traps that you place at ground level.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:37):**  So he placed those in both vineyards and he gave us the data from that.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:45):**  And by the way, to any of your listeners who are interested, we will be posting this on  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:49):**  YouTube, the presentation he gave.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:45:52):**  And we are definitely an open source operation and share everything that we're doing here  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:00):**  with anybody who's interested.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah, and to follow up on that for our listeners, as soon as that is on YouTube, we will also  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:08):**  share the link in the show notes, which you won't find the show notes on many podcast  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:13):**  platforms.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:14):**  But if you go to the podcast website at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com, we will include all the links that come  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:21):**  up in this conversation in the show notes to that as well.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:25):**  So the short answer to that is we have more diversity and in general, much higher populations.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:33):**  And one of them that was really high were the springtails.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:37):**  And so, but this, and according to Andy, through these live traps, we're just seeing a glimpse  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:45):**  and that's on the soil.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:46):**  That's basically at the soil surface.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:49):**  And so the next thing he has to do is measure the sticky traps that were more up by the  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:54):**  canopy.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:55):**  And so then we'll be able to see what's going on up there and that will take longer.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:46:59):**  So it'll be a little while, but once that information becomes available, we'll be sharing  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:03):**  that as well.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:05):**  And so all that we know is that we have very little insect pressure and we have a lot of  
**[0:47:13-0:47:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:13):**  pollinators, and we don't have to spray any organic products for insect pests.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:23):**  Another complimentary part of this system, we spoke a bit about the sheep and what they  
**[0:47:28-0:47:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:28):**  are contributing, but I'm curious about how your use of cover crops has evolved.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:35):**  Are you actually planting crops for the sheep to graze?  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:39):**  Are you just using what is naturally present?  
**[0:47:41-0:47:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:41):**  I mean, the reality is we know that many of the plants that we give the misnomer of weeds  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:50):**  are actually more nutritious than plants that we cultivate and have somewhat domesticated.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:56):**  So I'm curious about how that has evolved for you.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:47:59):**  That's a great question and it is something that is definitely evolving.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:05):**  The development phase of the vineyard started with using the principles of holistic management.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:11):**  So we selected a site, it was selected in part because in this climate, the perennials  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:18):**  grow on the north facing slopes.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:20):**  And so we selected a hillside that is primarily north facing because we're planting a perennial.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:25):**  And the ecosystem here is saying, okay, if you want to grow perennials, these are the  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:29):**  sites that we've determined are best for obvious reasons because there's less direct sunlight  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:35):**  and you can hold that moisture in there longer.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:37):**  So we initially kind of did a leveling of the ground.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:43):**  We put a light application of compost down and that was it the first year.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:48):**  We ran just cattle on that the first year and we had a forage consumption or forage  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:54):**  use of about seven animal days per acre.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:48:58):**  The next year we planted a cover crop, a mixed species cover crop, probably about, it wasn't  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:03):**  a high number mix, but it was probably around six or seven species.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:10):**  That year, our animal days per acre went up tenfold and so we had 70 animal days per acre.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:19):**  So just adding that cover crop in there dramatically increased that.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:22):**  I also think though that the compost had a little while to work its way into the soil  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:28):**  and get a better effect.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:29):**  I don't think you see that at least in this climate the first year.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:34):**  So since that time we have been using cover crops in the vineyard pretty consistently,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:42):**  but over the last few years I've started taking the number down, the number of species down  
**[0:49:50-0:49:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:50):**  and the amount down because of what is happening with the vineyard floor naturally.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:49:58):**  And so what that is is that we, again, we're in a Mediterranean climate so we get our moisture  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:04):**  during the winter and early spring and then in the summer it's completely dry.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:10):**  We are doing irrigation on the vines, but it's drip irrigation pretty much located right  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:15):**  around the base of the vine within a couple feet.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:19):**  And so the majority of that area is not getting irrigated, but we are, as each year as we  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:25):**  move forward we're seeing more and more native perennials in particular coming up and a lot  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:32):**  of those turn out to be pollinator plants.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:35):**  And so as things are drying out from the cover crop and the seed bank that's already here,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:41):**  which are a lot of probably annual grasses that were not native to this area, which is  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:47):**  the case with most of California.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:49):**  But as those start to die out then we're seeing things like milk vetch or milkweed, I'm sorry,  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:50:56):**  narrow leaf milkweed is coming in a lot and some of the other native plants are taking  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:02):**  over that floor.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:04):**  And so my thinking going forward is that we're going to probably within two years or so get  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:10):**  to the point where we don't have to feed any cover crops.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:13):**  And again, there's no tillage happening in here.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:17):**  And so right now, I just checked before this interview, we are at about, I think just below  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:25):**  50 species of plants growing in the vineyard.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:28):**  And they probably about, I'm going to say roughly a quarter, maybe a little bit more  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:38):**  than that are native species.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:40):**  And so with this management that I think that we will be able to phase out of our cover  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:46):**  crops.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:47):**  I'm beginning to understand the comment that you made earlier in this conversation that  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:52):**  you think the cumulative benefits of this system are just beginning to express themselves.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:51:58):**  I think you have lots of upward potential yet based on what you're describing.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:03):**  Yes.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:04):**  So, so far we've in our conversation, we've focused primarily on the agronomics of the  
**[0:52:11-0:52:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:11):**  system of wine, grape production and so forth.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:14):**  And there's still more to discuss.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:15):**  There are obviously, but I'm curious about the livestock component, the particular sheep  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:21):**  component.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:22):**  What are the economics of that?  
**[0:52:25-0:52:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:25):**  How have you found that to be improved as a result of incorporating wine grapes into  
**[0:52:32-0:52:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:32):**  sheep?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:34):**  So the, it was actually a, the sheep program here, we're up to just under 1700 years right  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:44):**  now.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:45):**  And I started that when I, when I, when I came to the ranch and we had a big influx  
**[0:52:51-0:52:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:51):**  of sheep numbers a little over a year ago from by buying a flock that was basically  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:52:58):**  burnt out of their rangeland from the fires in California.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:01):**  But so the, the sheep operation has been developing as the vineyard has been developing and we  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:09):**  have kind of a unique advantage in that the majority of the land here is rangeland.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:13):**  So we have plenty of space to have the sheep when we're not in the vineyard.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:17):**  And for instance, last summer we were just running the lamb, the, I'm sorry, the ram  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:22):**  flock in the vineyard during the growing season of the vines during the, during the summer.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:27):**  And that was plenty to cover the little bit amount of vegetation that was, was in there  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:32):**  during that time.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:34):**  But realistically this, this vineyard is such a small part of the grazing that the, that  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:41):**  the larger flock does.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:44):**  And for the first time this year we were able to, well actually it was in December, we were  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:48):**  able to bring in the entire flock of ewes.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:53):**  So we had about 1700 sheep on the vineyard for about 24 hours.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:53:59):**  And to get a really, a pretty high density on there.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:03):**  It always surprises me how it doesn't look as dense as you think it is.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:07):**  It might.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:08):**  And so in general though, what we will do probably starting in about a week or so, we  
**[0:54:14-0:54:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:14):**  will take the, the replacement ewes, which will be about 370 ewes that have not been  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:21):**  bred.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:22):**  And we will graze both the, both sections of the vineyard, the first phase that we planted  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:28):**  and grafted.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:29):**  And the second phase, which has not been grafted, it's just rootstock in the ground.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:33):**  We'll graze both of those sections in, for probably about two months.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:39):**  And that'll be again, there'll be in probably one acre, maybe two acre paddocks for that.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:47):**  And probably grazing for about approximately, let's say an acre a day.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:54:54):**  Given your background and familiarity with holistic management, what do you believe to  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:01):**  be the optimal grazing outline over a calendar year for your local ecosystem?  
**[0:55:08-0:55:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:08):**  And for our listeners, if you're not familiar with holistic management, it's very worthwhile  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:14):**  digging into and at least getting some basic familiarity with it.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:18):**  If you have any interests at all in working with livestock or grazing livestock, and it  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:23):**  is extraordinarily context dependent.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:26):**  So whatever answer Kelly has for us and what might be optimal for their environment is  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:31):**  almost certainly to be different from what that optimal answer would be for your environment.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:36):**  Thanks for that lead in John, because you saved me from doing that.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:40):**  And that is really important because oftentimes that is the first question people will ask  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:44):**  me if they're calling me from England or if they're calling me from Arizona.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:49):**  And it's like, how many sheep should we have in our vineyard?  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:52):**  And obviously the answer is, it depends.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:55:56):**  And then the next question that if people are thinking is that what do I do with my  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:01):**  sheep if I can't keep them in the vineyard all the time, which is generally the case  
**[0:56:05-0:56:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:05):**  because you're usually going to need to get in there for something in which you need to  
**[0:56:10-0:56:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:10):**  probably remove all the sheep.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:12):**  And so that is something that needs to be considered.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:15):**  And so for our particular context here, ideally we would graze probably, and again, this is  
**[0:56:23-0:56:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:23):**  rainfall, totally rainfall dependent, and we would ideally graze at least two times  
**[0:56:31-0:56:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:31):**  during the non-growing season of the vine.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:33):**  So this is winter grazing.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:36):**  And ideally it would be three to four grazings, but three would be pretty much as much as  
**[0:56:44-0:56:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:44):**  I could hope for here.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:46):**  But during the summertime, because, or let's go into the spring.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:56:53):**  So after the leaves have come out, then we could go into the vineyard as long as all  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:00):**  the vines are up and trained to the height they need to be.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:03):**  And so we have a little gap between when we plant the vines and when we can actually graze  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:08):**  that during the growing season of the vines.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:11):**  And last year, in order to deal with, in order to be able to graze some of those areas where  
**[0:57:15-0:57:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:15):**  we had some vines that were too small to be left unprotected, we put some tall grow tubes  
**[0:57:21-0:57:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:21):**  in there to protect those vines.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:23):**  And we have totally redone how we are going to train the next round of vines in order  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:29):**  to get them up to the cordon wire as fast as possible, because then we can really start  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:34):**  getting the benefits.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:36):**  So back to the ideally three grazings during the dormant season of the vine.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:41):**  And then once the vines start budding out, we could probably get in another one to two  
**[0:57:48-0:57:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:48):**  grazings with a fairly decent sized flock, say averaging maybe around 200 sheep per acre  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:56):**  per day.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:57:58):**  So if you had 200 sheep, you would be grazing, you could graze the whole vineyard in about  
**[0:58:05-0:58:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:05):**  20 days or so.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:08):**  And then during the dormant season of the vegetation, during the summer, your numbers  
**[0:58:13-0:58:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:13):**  would probably go way down to something more like around 25 to 50 animals that you again  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:24):**  are doing moves through that area and allowing inadequate recovery for both the plants and  
**[0:58:29-0:58:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:29):**  the soils.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:31):**  And so, and that would go on for probably until pretty close to harvest.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:38):**  And then after harvest, you might do one additional grazing and then you might have a period of  
**[0:58:44-0:58:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:44):**  time that could be anywhere from two months to five months before you could go back in.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:51):**  Last year, we didn't get, we only had really one rain event and that was at the end of,  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:56):**  towards the end of March.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:58:58):**  And so that would, and we weren't really, we did one grazing in the vineyard, but there  
**[0:59:03-0:59:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:03):**  was very little to eat in there.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:05):**  Kelly, this is such a rich topic and I think it's a topic.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:10):**  I really hope that your work becomes very widely known and many people begin adopting  
**[0:59:17-0:59:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:17):**  it because it's something that's so badly needed in agriculture generally is to develop  
**[0:59:21-0:59:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:21):**  these perennial type systems that really regenerate ecosystems.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:27):**  And there's so much, so many different tangents and rabbit holes I'd like to go down.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:33):**  There are a few kind of big picture questions I'd like to ask yet, which is what, from your  
**[0:59:41-0:59:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:41):**  perspective, what you've observed, how adaptable is this system to other perennial crops like  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:47):**  tree fruit and orchards and nuts and so forth?  
**[0:59:50-0:59:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:50):**  So people are already doing this in tree crops for sure.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=0:59:55):**  And in particular with walnuts in California and almonds, people are starting to do it  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:03):**  in almonds as well.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:04):**  There obviously are concerns of food safety.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:08):**  Was about to ask that.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:10):**  In a sense, one of the reasons that wine was pretty easy to go into is because there is  
**[1:00:18-1:00:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:18):**  essentially a kill step in taking a grape and fermenting it and getting the alcohol  
**[1:00:25-1:00:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:25):**  up to a level where basically you don't have issues of pathogens in there.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:31):**  So that makes it, we were able to get this early on.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:36):**  I worked with CCOF to make sure that this was going to be allowable.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:43):**  And because of that, it actually, while I was in New Zealand doing work, they weren't  
**[1:00:47-1:00:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:47):**  able to certify their stuff as organic because they were doing some leaf pulling in the summer  
**[1:00:52-1:00:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:52):**  and they were able to change that as well.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:00:55):**  But so food safety is always going to be an issue and I mean, because of the work that  
**[1:01:02-1:01:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:02):**  people like David Johnson have been doing and showing how as a soil gets, as the soil  
**[1:01:11-1:01:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:11):**  improves in its health and structure, then a lot of these pathogens and soil are actually  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:19):**  going away.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:20):**  And so I think that oftentimes, again, it's the cause of a lot of the food safety issues  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:28):**  is our farming practices.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:30):**  And it's an indication of the problem.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:32):**  It's not actually the problem itself.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:35):**  I love that.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:38):**  So of course, if you're the recipient of food that has problems, it's obviously not going  
**[1:01:46-1:01:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:46):**  to be fun.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:47):**  But really, I think, again, there's so much work in this realm that needs to be looked  
**[1:01:53-1:01:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:53):**  at and how we create healthy soils so that we don't have those issues.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:01:59):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:00):**  And so what you mentioned that people are doing this now in nut production, how are  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:07):**  they managing the food safety concerns?  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:09):**  What's the pathway to resolving that?  
**[1:02:11-1:02:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:11):**  Well, for them, I think technically they need to have that waiting period.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:18):**  One of the ways going forward that I think we can bypass that, so for instance, in nuts,  
**[1:02:22-1:02:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:22):**  is if we are shaking the nuts and collecting that in a tarp above ground, that the nuts  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:30):**  never touch the ground, then we can potentially bypass that.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:34):**  And I'm just speculating on that.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:37):**  But I know that there's some people that are looking at that.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:39):**  And also that helps if you're looking at how you manage your ecosystem, your agricultural  
**[1:02:46-1:02:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:46):**  ecosystem.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:47):**  If one of the things you have to do is make that ground as bare and flat as possible to  
**[1:02:51-1:02:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:51):**  harvest your nuts, that is probably not contributing to soil health.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:55):**  So bypassing that by changing your harvest practice has a double benefit.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:02:59):**  Kelly, you're way too soft.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:03):**  Let's just say that making soil flat and firm is definitely going to damage soil health.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:08):**  No questions, no holds barred.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:11):**  Thank you for that.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:16):**  So here's another important question.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:20):**  How does this idea of incorporating livestock into perennial crops, not just transfer to  
**[1:03:26-1:03:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:26):**  other crops, but how does it transfer to other regions?  
**[1:03:30-1:03:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:30):**  And specifically, I'm interested in the possibilities of transferring this to the dry land Midwest,  
**[1:03:37-1:03:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:37):**  where there is the mindset or the perception that the only thing we can grow here is wheat  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:45):**  and corn and soybeans and Milo.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:48):**  And yet it seems to me there is a perfect opportunity in some of these dry land climates  
**[1:03:51-1:03:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:51):**  to grow crops such as grapes.  
**[1:03:54-1:04:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:03:54):**  And this seems to me to be a management system that could transfer into that context very  
**[1:04:00-1:04:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:00):**  well.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:01):**  But I'd love to get your perspective on that.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:03):**  Well, it's interesting if you look at some of the climate maps that people like Greg  
**[1:04:08-1:04:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:08):**  Jones, who's a climatologist and grew up in a vineyard, are doing.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:15):**  Some of the regions that he has marked as prime viticultural areas in this country are  
**[1:04:22-1:04:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:22):**  places like North Dakota and getting into Canada and a lot of places that aren't growing  
**[1:04:28-1:04:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:28):**  grapes now.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:29):**  But the way that the weather is changing, the climate is changing, it's going to open  
**[1:04:35-1:04:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:35):**  up places that are more suitable to growing grapes than places like this now.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:41):**  So there's that change that's occurring.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:43):**  So this same system that we're talking about, the same process of designing for your ecosystem,  
**[1:04:52-1:04:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:52):**  I think could work with table grapes as well, with raisin grapes as well, with all kinds  
**[1:04:56-1:04:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:56):**  of different fruit crops.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:04:58):**  And it kind of goes back to that design aspect.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:01):**  How do you design and manage for food safety issues?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:08):**  Because animals have been on the planet longer than us.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:14):**  And so again, it's going back to how do we create systems that go beyond the problems  
**[1:05:20-1:05:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:20):**  that we're facing by designing for more complexity and health.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:24):**  Yeah, and you know, for us as farmers and in the farming community, we've become indoctrinated  
**[1:05:33-1:05:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:33):**  to agriculture ecosystems that don't include livestock.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:37):**  We've become comfortable with ecosystems that are divorced from livestock.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:43):**  And what that has done is we have lost an appreciation for what livestock can actually  
**[1:05:50-1:05:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:50):**  contribute.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:51):**  They are perceived as being management intensive.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:05:53):**  They are perceived as not offering the returns that you might experience with pure crop production.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:02):**  And yet there is this effect.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:04):**  I think Norman Uphof described it so well in the interview that I had with him.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:10):**  There is this compounding synergistic effect, or you could almost call it an algorithmic  
**[1:06:14-1:06:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:14):**  synergistic effect where one plus one doesn't equal two.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:19):**  And you get into these cases where one plus one doesn't equal 11 anymore.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:22):**  It now equals 1100.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:25):**  And so when you think about what you're describing, you're changing the system where you're changing  
**[1:06:32-1:06:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:32):**  slightly the way the vineyard and the grape mines themselves are managed.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:37):**  You're incorporating livestock, you're incorporating cover crops and grazing.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:41):**  And the combination of those management changes produces outcomes that are much, much bigger  
**[1:06:48-1:06:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:48):**  than you might anticipate.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:49):**  They're not additive.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:50):**  They are compounding or algorithmic.  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:06:55):**  That I think is something that we've largely lost sight of in our crop production systems  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:00):**  across the Midwest and well around the world for that matter in our emphasis on having  
**[1:07:05-1:07:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:05):**  monoculture crops.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:08):**  And the reality is that working with perennial crops rather than annuals is perhaps one of  
**[1:07:12-1:07:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:12):**  the easiest places for us to incorporate livestock and these types of perennialized systems in  
**[1:07:18-1:07:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:18):**  place.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:21):**  I think that's definitely true.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:23):**  Although I will say that before we came out to California, my wife and I were growing  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:29):**  crops about 60 different types of vegetable crops as a commercial operation in the San  
**[1:07:34-1:07:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:34):**  Luis Valley and preceding again, San Luis Valley is high altitude, very cold, short  
**[1:07:41-1:07:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:41):**  90 day growing season.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:43):**  So the preceding year we managed livestock on the farm, on the section that we were going  
**[1:07:49-1:07:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:49):**  to farm food crops on, vegetable crops.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:53):**  We had high density grazing there.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:07:56):**  And when we came in the second year and planted that, we had some of the highest quality produce  
**[1:08:01-1:08:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:01):**  I've ever experienced.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:03):**  And that was actually verified by the people that were buying produce from us.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:06):**  They called and said, we want to come out and look at your farm.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:09):**  And I said, is everything okay?  
**[1:08:10-1:08:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:10):**  They said, yeah, everything's okay.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:11):**  We just want to see what you're doing.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:13):**  And they said, we've never heard of you guys and you have the highest quality food crops  
**[1:08:19-1:08:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:19):**  coming into our company.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:21):**  There were wholesalers that we've ever seen.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:24):**  What are you doing?  
**[1:08:26-1:08:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:26):**  And so, and it was incredibly simple.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:30):**  So there's enormous opportunity here.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:34):**  Such a great illustration.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:35):**  And the other illustration that describes this is the example that you noted of having  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:41):**  sheep grazing on the grapevines, producing a 22 bricks reading.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:46):**  The highest point that you'd ever measure was when you actually had the presence of  
**[1:08:49-1:08:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:49):**  livestock.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:50):**  There's stuff going on here that we don't fully understand yet.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:54):**  We haven't fully quantified it and maybe we never will, but it's important for us to just  
**[1:08:59-1:09:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:08:59):**  recognize that these compounding effects are there.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:03):**  They're present.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:04):**  And we would be wise to take advantage of them and foolish not to.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:08):**  I think that's really critical.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:10):**  Nature has given us so many examples of how to do things and we need to start paying attention  
**[1:09:15-1:09:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:15):**  to them.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:16):**  Yeah.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:17):**  Kelly, thank you so much for being here and for sharing your wisdom and your experiences.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:24):**  And for all of our listeners, Kelly has some other really great resources that he has developed,  
**[1:09:30-1:09:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:30):**  articles that he's published and videos that he's put out there.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:33):**  We will link those in our show notes that you can find on the Region of Agriculture  
**[1:09:37-1:09:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:37):**  podcast website.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:40):**  And if you want to dig deeper into these types of management systems, and Kelly also mentioned  
**[1:09:46-1:09:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:46):**  that he's using plant sap analysis and foliar sprays.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:49):**  If you have any questions about that, feel free to reach out to our team at advancingecoag.com.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:53):**  We'd love to work with you and look forward to connecting with all of you.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:09:58):**  And again, Kelly, thank you for being here.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:00):**  I've really enjoyed this conversation and I'm sure everyone else has as well.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:04):**  Thank you, John.  
**[1:10:06-1:10:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:06):**  The team at AEA and I are dedicated to bringing this show to you because we believe that knowledge  
**[1:10:11-1:10:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:11):**  and information is the foundation of successful regenerative systems.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:16):**  At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food and making more money from your crops  
**[1:10:21-1:10:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:21):**  is possible.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:23):**  And since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers to help them do just  
**[1:10:27-1:10:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:27):**  that.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:28):**  At AEA, we don't guess, we test, we analyze, and we provide recommendations based on scientific  
**[1:10:34-1:10:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:34):**  data, knowledge, and experience.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:37):**  We've developed products that are uniquely positioned to help growers make more money  
**[1:10:40-1:10:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:40):**  with regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:42):**  If you are a professional grower who believes in testing instead of guessing, someone who  
**[1:10:47-1:10:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:47):**  believes in a better, more regenerative way to grow, visit advancingecoag.com and contact  
**[1:10:53-1:10:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:53):**  us to see if AEA is right for you.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-80-kelly-mulville#t=1:10:56):**  Thank you for listening and we look forward to working with you.

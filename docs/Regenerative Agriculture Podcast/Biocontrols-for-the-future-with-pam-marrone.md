### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-22-30)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which all other growing systems  are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media or email me,

**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:34):**  an exceptional entrepreneur who's done quite a bit  of intriguing work in the area of bio pesticides  and bio stimulants.  Pam, you've had a very interesting pathway in life,  working with your degree at Cornell,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:46):**  working for Monsanto and Entotec, your work at AgriQuest,  most recently at Marrone BioInnovations.  You've had a fascinating pathway,  I've found it very intriguing.  Can you tell us a little bit about the journey  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:59):**  that you've been on and what has brought you to the point  that you are today and the things that you're working on?  Sure, I started from way back, oh gosh,  when I was a little girl growing up in rural Connecticut.  And I watched the gypsy moths ravage the trees  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:15):**  and my father ended up using BT, bacillus thuringiensis,  which was the first ever microbial bio insecticide  commercialized and he was trying to save some,  a dogwood tree right outside the kitchen window.  And it was intriguing to me that there was this  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:32):**  naturally occurring microbe that could control caterpillars.  And I was seven, eight, nine years old  when he was using that product.  So I was determined to become an entomologist  and then look for ways to control pests naturally.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:46):**  That was what I decided I was gonna do.  And so I started at Monsanto  and had a very non-traditional career there.  I was hired to start up a unit looking for ways  to control insects without the use of chemicals.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:00):**  And this was before that was right  when the GMO stuff was happening.  So I set up a natural product screening  where we screened over 150,000 microorganisms  looking for natural products.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:12):**  And they cut that program of course,  and ended up in shifting me to work on GMOs.  And I got a call from a Danish company I'd never heard of,  Novo Nordisk, who said they wanted me to start up a company  in the United States somewhere,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:26):**  which we ended up Davis, California,  screening microbes looking for natural products.  And I was like, whoa,  I get to continue what I really love to do.  I fell in love with screening for natural products  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:36):**  and looking for natural products for controlling pests.  So moved to Davis and then my group screen,  meaning isolated and discovered and tested against pests,  another 55,000 microbes.  And then Novo Nordisk decided to sell us  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:52):**  just when we were starting to really get some headway.  They sold us to our largest competitor,  which is now Valen Biosciences.  And I left and started up AgriQuest in 1995.  And then we screened another 22,000 microbes,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:08):**  came up with a line of biofungicides,  which are now very well known, Serenade and Sonata,  and then started this one in 2006.  And the idea with this company was to find microbes  and plant extracts across the full range of grower needs.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:24):**  So not just fungicides, but also insect control,  nematode control, plant health and stress reduction,  and ultimately weed control.  And weed control has been the toughest,  but we're working on it and making headway.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:39):**  So that's the nature of my career.  And yeah, it's unique in starting up companies  and being able to follow biopesticides,  biocontrol all the way through.  Pam, you described some very memorable moments.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:52):**  I find it very intriguing where we get inspiration  for our life's work.  And so one of the questions that I have for you  is throughout your pathway,  what have been some of the memorable moments  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:03):**  when you look back, what are some of the things  that really stand out to you that were unexpected,  that came as a surprise?  Well, certainly each time I started with the R&D groups  we had started screening, the number of things we found  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:21):**  that were pesticides was amazing.  And yet there were so few, if you look at the numbers,  only 15% of pesticides are derived from natural sources,  but more than 50% of your drugs.  So each time we found all these discoveries and said,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:40):**  wow, the natural world is full of these things,  but why have so few made it to market?  And so each time I set up these groups,  what we found was that you can find a needle  in a haystack, certainly, you can search the world,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:57):**  but as you gain knowledge over time, you can find,  what's really interesting was that you can actually see  patterns in nature.  So like, where can you find a microorganism  that kills insects versus a microorganism  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:12):**  that kills plant diseases?  Well, they're interestingly different sources.  So we found that finding an insecticidal microbe,  you had a higher chance if you looked like in conifer litter  under conifer trees or rotting stumps,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:29):**  whereas with looking for fungicidal microbes,  dry creek beds were really good sources,  also isolating from the surface of the plant  or the roots, as you might expect.  There's these patterns in nature that you can sort out  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:42):**  over time as you become expert in these things.  The conversation has really shifted around the biocontrols  and biostimulants and just the plant microbiome in general,  even 10 years ago in mainstream agriculture,  there was at least in my observation experience,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:59):**  very little dialogue around a plant microbiome.  And today that conversation has dramatically shifted  where there's a lot of discussion in the areas  of biostimulants and biocontrol,  something that you've been leading in  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:15):**  for your entire career.  Yeah, it's remarkable that there's been a shift now  and it's very exciting to see  because the basis for organic farming, as you know,  is a healthy soil equals a healthy plant.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:27):**  So organic farmers have had the focus on microbial  biodiversity in the soil and healthy soil for a long time,  but now there's healthy soil initiatives  for conventional farmers, which is great to see  because then that leads to a healthier plant  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:44):**  if you have a healthier soil,  regardless of whether you're organic or conventional.  And so I, yes, I was way ahead of my time,  but now it's interesting to see  that this is becoming mainstream.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:55):**  I was just at a Rockefeller funded  and OECD funded think tank in Italy  two weeks ago and we had the top researchers  in the microbiome for plants  and natural products researchers there  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:10):**  giving their talks about what they've learned.  And now with the modern tools of genomics  and also your molecular tools, gene editing and so forth,  you can find out much faster what's happening  with the microbiome on the plant  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:25):**  and also what plants are producing  in terms of natural products.  So you can sort out better what's happening in the soil  and on the plant.  It's not easy because there was one researcher  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:36):**  who's found that the microbiome on the roots changed  depending on whether the land,  it was wheat, was irrigated or not.  And they found different microbes shifting from,  you could actually shift the microbes  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:51):**  depending on whether you're irrigated or not.  And then when you were in the transition of irrigating  from dry land to irrigation, you changed them.  You had a shift sort of in between microbiome.  So while these modern tools of molecular biology  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:04):**  and such are really helping,  there's still a lot of complex patterns in nature  that we don't understand,  which we will understand more and more over time.  I think the comment that you just made  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:13):**  around shifting the microbiome is very relevant  to a conversation which is gaining a lot more awareness  is the desire to create or develop a disease-suppressive  soil and understanding that if we really want to develop  a disease-suppressive soil microbial community  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:29):**  and soil microbiome, then that's really a conversation  about shifting the soil environment  and the macro environment.  It is, and this researcher, her name is Linda Tamashow,  and she's a USDA researcher in Pullman, Washington.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:42):**  She studied the suppressive soil of wheat over time  and why in some fields take all disease declines,  but it was a long-term shift.  So it didn't happen overnight.  And interestingly, everyone assumes that it's a cocktail  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:58):**  of microbes or a consortium of microbes  that causes the suppressive soil.  In her case, she found that it actually was one  natural compound that was excreted  by the taxonomic group of microbes  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:11):**  that was causing the reduction in take-all.  Really was the primary effect was one single metabolite.  So there are these things, these rules now,  I'm hearing farmers say,  well, I gotta have a consortia to have the suppressive soil.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:25):**  And she found that wasn't necessarily true.  So interestingly, there could be a dominant player  or there could be a consortia.  So again, no rules really apply yet.  We're still learning about this.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:39):**  You mentioned a moment ago that 50% of pharmaceutical drugs  are bio-derived if I understood you correctly.  Right.  And a much smaller percentage of the agricultural pesticides  and agricultural chemicals are bio-derived.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:54):**  One of the questions that I sometimes hear is,  growers are asking the question,  what are the systemic advantages  or what are the advantages to the overall ecosystem  of using biocontrols as compared to using synthetic,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:09):**  pharmaceutical grade or pharmaceutical quality pesticides?  Well, one thing is that the biopesticides  or bio control microorganisms or extracts of plants  tend to be more biodegradable.  So they break down much more quickly.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:24):**  And because you can't hook synthetic groups to them,  so you're a lot of modern chemicals,  you can make them more persistent by hooking on bromines  or halogen compounds.  And so one of the advantages  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:37):**  and also disadvantage is biodegradability,  but that is an advantage.  And also, so they don't affect the existing microbiome  as much or also the beneficial organisms on the plant,  honeybees, lacewings, lady beetles,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:53):**  the predatory mites, most biologicals  are generally non-toxic or low risk  to your non-target organisms.  So for in terms of developing a system,  a holistic system, that's really a benefit.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:10):**  And also because of the complex modes of action  of most biologicals,  you don't have the resistance developing.  Most modern chemicals today have a single side of action.  So the pests and pathogens can develop or weeds  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:24):**  can develop quite quickly.  And that's not the case with 99% of the biologicals.  There's only a couple of cases globally in 70 years  where pests have developed resistance  to biological pesticides.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:37):**  So that durability, sustainability.  The other thing is that biologicals,  whether it be a biopesticide or biostimulant  are generally produced with agricultural raw materials.  So for example, our products are made in fermentation.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:53):**  So we put soy flour in the media  when we make the microbe and other natural raw materials.  So, and then our waste is also all biodegradable  natural waste product from the agricultural raw materials.  So the whole process of making the product is,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:16):**  I would say sustainable in terms of the definition  because of its ingredients and biodegradability.  I think one of the key pieces  that we are beginning to understand better  is the need to develop whole farm systems.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:36):**  And I know that many growers are expressing a strong desire  to develop a cropping system  where they have a reduced dependency on pesticides.  And we have a challenge of course, on the research side  in terms of product validation, et cetera,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:52):**  where research is primarily focused  on single factor analysis  rather than a multi-factor analysis or systems analysis.  What hurdles have you encountered with the adoption  or the validation of biocontrols in that research context?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:12):**  This is such a timely topic question you just asked.  I've had a lot of discussion over this  over the last three months.  And this was a keen topic of the think tank I was in Italy.  It's come up when talking to regulators,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:27):**  when there's regulatory action or court action  to remove a chemical pesticide.  And then indeed I was down  with one of the largest citrus growers in Florida recently  talking about sustainable solutions  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:38):**  for controlling citrus greening and Asian citrus psyllid.  And that can certainly be applied to California  where we're getting some outbreaks of that.  And everyone in these conversations agreed  with what you just said.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:50):**  And that is university research is very reductionist.  It's single factor.  So you'll test one single biological  against the chemical program.  It might even be chemical cocktail  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:02):**  whereas you're testing a single biological against that.  And you're not looking at the whole system  or developing a whole IPM program.  And the farmers are saying,  there's no longer silver bullets anymore.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:13):**  There's no silver bullet for replacing methyl bromide.  The interim solutions,  the chemical fumigants are just that interim.  They're gonna be restricted over time.  The same with Asian citrus psyllid.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:26):**  There's no single bullet.  So why is the funding going more towards  either very long-term basic research  or single factor research instead of whole system research?  There needs to be funding from the various agencies  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:43):**  whether it's USDA, NIFA or where else  to fund on-farm holistic IPM programs.  And that's where the gap is missing  because who's around to actually develop  a multi-factor system where you're implementing  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:59):**  all the tools.  It's cultural, it's variety selection, it's soil health,  it's other cultural tools enhancing your biologicals  or multiple, it might not just be one chemical  but multiple solutions.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:12):**  And so, but who's doing that?  And is there money for it?  I think you're absolutely right  is that we need to be doing that  because the reality is that is how natural ecosystems work.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:24):**  That's how farmers are forced to work.  And so in order for research to be applicable,  it really needs to be multi-factorial.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:36):**  And that's where there's a big gap.  And I'm increasingly hearing that from farmers  over and over and over again.  We need a multi-factor solutions on the farm  in a holistic system.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:46):**  And while it's nice to look at insecticide fungicide reports  and see the single factor efficacy trials  from the land grant institutions,  I need more than that because the silver bullets,  you can't use them as silver bullets anymore.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:02):**  You'll get resistance.  Some of them are restricted already regulatory wise  so you can't use them as much.  You have limits on the number of sprays you can use.  So how are these gonna be incorporated in  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:13):**  and enhancing my beneficials, improving my soil health.  Down in the citrus, talking to the large grower,  there were definite differences and tolerances  of the different citrus varieties to the citrus greening.  And that's where it starts.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:29):**  Pam, you've helped found or a leading founder  of the Bioproducts Industry Alliance.  And we spoke a moment ago about the shifting discussion  and conversation that is happening  in the agriculture space around biocontrols.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:44):**  In the conversations that I have with growers,  I see many growers have a strong desire for biocontrols.  Agronomists want to understand how to use them better.  And then we of course historically have had  some regulatory challenges getting products  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:57):**  to be approved in the marketplace.  One of the questions that I know many listeners  have a strong interest in is where's the future?  How do you see the use of biocontrols  and biopesticides evolving in the future  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:10):**  as compared to industry development  of pharmaceutical quality pesticides?  Well, the market is growing faster  for biologicals than for chemicals.  So the chemical pesticide market is relatively flat,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:24):**  a single digit growth,  whereas biologicals is growing between 15 and 20%.  So clearly something is happening.  And what's happening?  Both organic and conventional growers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:35):**  are adopting these at a more rapid rate.  And they're learning how to use them better.  But that's the key is first of all, awareness.  Our surveys show that a lot of farmers  still are completely unaware of the category  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:50):**  and unaware of the products available.  Number two is how to use them.  Because the modes of action of these products are unique  and often very different from chemicals,  it is a higher education and it's not do they work,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:02):**  it's how to make them work  and how to make them work in integrated programs.  Going back to that single factor analysis,  you'll see reams of data from university researchers  showing about pesticide  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:14):**  against the best cocktail of chemicals.  And then maybe it's not quite as good,  so it doesn't get used.  But then that's such a shame  because when it's integrated into a program,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:24):**  it might be a rotation or a tank mixture,  then the biologicals will make the whole program better.  So it's really understanding how to use.  And that is a gap we see also  who's doing that educational piece.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:39):**  So it falls to the companies like ours,  but really there needs to be a lot more education.  It is changing at the land grants  as some of the older researchers retire  and new ones come in  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:49):**  and they're generally more open  to really learning how to use these products  and really helping the growers learn how to use them.  Cornell, it's a shining example.  I was at the Geneva Research Farm this summer  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:01):**  now called Cornell AgriTech.  And there's a professor, Dr. Cox, who said,  I think I'm gonna be able to develop  an all biological system for controlling fire blight  that works just as well as antibiotics and copper,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:12):**  which are both undesirable  from the environmental standpoint.  So you're seeing that generational change  in being able to help the farmer understand  how to integrate these and use them,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:25):**  which is how they're best used.  Pam, this next question is a question  that I've asked many of the guests  who joined me here on the podcast  with many intriguing responses.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:37):**  What is something that you believe to be true  about modern agriculture that is perhaps different  from the mainstream viewpoint?  She pauses.  I'm not thinking about that one.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:58):**  Well, there may be a belief that you always will need  to use chemicals in every case.  And ultimately the way you look at agriculture today  is dominated by chemicals,  and then you dial in biologicals only when needed.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:17):**  Okay, what you can see in the future  is that you rely on this holistic system  we're talking about integrating all the cultural tools  of true IPM.  You incorporate all the cultural tools,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:30):**  plant health, soil health, biologicals,  and then you use chemicals only when needed.  So you turn it, you flip it.  And I think that there's already a model system for that.  So when Azanfos methyl, guthion was banned,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:46):**  restricted for controlling codling moth in apples,  pears, and nuts on the West Coast here,  it created a crisis and a consortium of growers  and University of California  formed the Randall Island Project,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:04):**  and they were determined to find alternate way  to control codling moth.  And there weren't any chemicals coming along at the time.  So they relied on pheromones  and ended up in a wide area pheromone program,  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:19):**  developing pheromones as the basis  for controlling codling moth,  and then you only dialed in chemicals when needed.  So there's a perfect example  of when you have public private partnership,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:31):**  you can develop a system, a sustainable system,  where it's robust, sustainably, long lasting,  and economically viable for the growers.  There are many other examples where that could be done.  And so we are shifting  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:49):**  to a more ecologically based program over time.  Pam, in the work that you have done,  working with ecosystems,  developing these biocontrol products  over the last number of decades,  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:02):**  what has been something that came as a pleasant surprise?  What was unexpected?  The amazing diversity of things.  You could find a solution to any problem in nature.  So if you wanna control a pest,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:21):**  you can find a natural solution to control that pest,  if you look enough and know where to look.  So we actually did that here at Meron Bio.  So we said, we heard over and over and over again  that the pathogens, plant disease causing pathogens  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:39):**  were constantly developing resistance  to various downy mildews.  And the growers said both the chemical  and biological solutions for downy mildews,  like lettuce downy mildew, grape downy mildew,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:52):**  were just not good enough and they needed more tools.  So we went and said, okay,  we're gonna find a solution specifically  to oomycetes or the downy mildews.  And we screened 16,000 microbes looking for a solution.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:07):**  And lo and behold, we had some candidates  and we commercialized one.  So there's just an example of,  and we've done that multiple times.  We did the same with, we're gonna look for a solution  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:17):**  for controlling this nematode.  And so that can continue  because of the amazing diversity of microorganisms  and also not just the microorganism itself,  but the byproducts of the microorganisms.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:33):**  So the microorganisms produce compounds  that control pests and plant pathogens and even weeds.  And the diversity of,  just like penicillin comes from a mold,  the diversity of those compounds is also,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:47):**  in many ways, just amazing.  And I don't know if it was unexpected, but it is amazing.  We keep finding novel compounds that are new  and never known and never not discovered before.  Same, we found several new species of bacteria.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:02):**  And so I think there's just so much more out there.  We're just in the very early stages  of harnessing the natural world out there,  both the plant natural products, microorganisms,  and the compounds they produce.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:16):**  I find that perspective to be so intriguing.  There's so much that we still don't know,  and yet we also have learned a lot.  So there's obviously tremendous value  and a lot of benefit in developing products,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:29):**  such as you have been developing with various companies,  that growers can use.  But there is also,  I think we also have to ask the question,  how much of these various microbes  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:41):**  and the beneficial value they bring  can we tap into simply by managing ecosystems?  Yep.  Can we produce those same benefits  and those same effects by managing our ecosystems  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:51):**  rather than focusing on a single product?  What are your thoughts?  I do think that's the basis  for a whole crop production system.  That's where we ultimately will get to.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:02):**  And that is the basis for organic agriculture.  As you know, organic farmers use a lot fewer inputs.  And why?  They have a healthier ecosystem, more biodiversity,  so the pests and diseases don't outbreak as much.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:14):**  But occasionally you're gonna need some,  so they do use tools.  But ultimately, yes,  as you enhance the soil, enhance the microbiome,  and understand what's going on,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:25):**  interactions with weather and soil type and crop variety,  and it is complex,  ultimately you can develop, like I said before,  a whole base of your system is ecologically based,  and then you only add inputs when you need them.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:41):**  And organic farmers,  that's the whole basis of organic farming philosophy,  sometimes not always practiced that way,  but anyway, that is,  and certainly conventional farmers  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:51):**  are moving in that direction.  Pam, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  What do I wish all farmers knew?  I'm gonna be very selfish in that one.  There's a lingering perception  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:05):**  that biologicals are weaker than chemicals in performance.  And it's actually not true,  because when you incorporate them into the program,  they can actually strengthen  and enhance the entire pest management  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:23):**  or crop production program.  So I wish that growers would look at integrated programs  instead of just single factor analysis  when it comes to looking at biologicals.  I would like farmers to start from the basis  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:37):**  that these products do work,  but it's how to make them work rather than,  oh, they're weaker.  Well, I can certainly second that.  And I can speak from experience  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:50):**  on many different types of crops,  many different types of operations  where biologicals and biocontrols  have been successful,  where chemical controls were unsuccessful.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:02):**  So they have the capacity to be incredibly effective,  I think partially because of the broad range  of mode of actions.  There are so many more modes of action  than they're sometimes present with pesticides.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:13):**  And I think from my observation, my perspective,  when they are used as a part of a management system,  in many cases, they can be equally  or sometimes even more effective  than their pesticide counterparts.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:27):**  Yes, and that is the key when used  as part of the management system.  And that the problem is, as we said earlier,  that the testing is done in a reductionist way  rather than integrated as part of the management program.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:41):**  And so we have to encourage researchers  or fund the research to go to the next step  in the land grant system.  So it's more like how the farmers  use the products on the farm.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:53):**  So Pam, if you wanted to advise a grower or a farmer  where to get more information,  what resources or what books would you recommend  to growers who want to learn more about biocontrols  and biosimilants, the products that are available  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:06):**  and how they might be able to use them?  Well, ATRA is a good place,  the Association for Responsible Technology.  They do have a lot of information  and they do have a database where you can search  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:18):**  and get info.  IR4, which is housed at Rutgers,  does have a searchable database.  And the BioProducts Industry Alliance  has information on the website  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:31):**  about these types of products.  I have started a BioBytes section on our website  where I have cataloged a number of articles I've written,  other people's articles on this topic,  as well as some of the previous podcasts I've done.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:49):**  So that's another resource.  Thanks for sharing those.  And for those of you listening,  we will link to the various resources  that Pam has shared in the podcast description as well,  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:58):**  that you can follow those links very easily.  Pam, what is a question that you wish I would have asked?  Well, we didn't talk about some of the other benefits  of biological programs.  We focused on the ecologically based part of it  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:15):**  and whole systems approach,  but there are other factors that can really be benefits.  So for example, in tight times of immigrant farm labor,  where some farmers I know  are having a tough time getting workers,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:28):**  you wanna manage your labor better.  And so you can spray in the morning  and be back in the field with the biological products  because of their safety level.  So that's a real benefit.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:38):**  And then when a lot of farmers export  and they export to foreign markets,  and a lot of these foreign markets  are not accepting the US levels of pesticide residues  and going beyond the US levels,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:50):**  and so have either none or lower levels.  So biologically you can spray  and right at the end of the season  and you don't leave any residues.  The other thing I'll mention is that  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:01):**  what we're seeing is that there's new technology  in terms of sensors, software, robotics, drones,  all kinds of technology, hardware and software, digital ag,  that's being applied to crop production and pest management  so that there's gonna be leaps and bounds made  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:22):**  in understanding the microbiome  and soil health and plant health.  But at the same time,  there's going to be better ways to track pest populations  through remote sensing,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:36):**  making it more efficient to be able to learn  how to integrate biologicals  and predict when you have to spray or not.  So modeling when a disease comes in  or when a pest comes in.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:49):**  So for example,  I know that there's some postdoc at UC Davis  who was modeling the movement of ligus from major crops.  So when they cut alfalfa,  that certainly makes sense that when the alfalfa's cut,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:05):**  the ligus bugs don't have any place to go,  so they then move into a crop nearby  and then they devastate whether it's strawberries  or peppers or what have you.  So there's gonna be a lot more things happening  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:17):**  where growers are gonna be able to have a lot more tools  to be able to predict pest populations  and what's actually happening on the farm.  So you'll be able to have little video systems  to watch the insect, the aphids right out in the farm  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:31):**  and digital imaging where you know  after a certain crop production method,  you'll be able to see whether what you're doing  is enhancing the,  you don't have to wait for the whole season  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:42):**  and then measure yield,  you'll be able to see it through imaging much sooner.  There's a company called Ag Shift  that is using artificial intelligence  to develop an iPhone app  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:55):**  where you can just snap a photo of your crop,  the actual fruit or nut,  and then it will tell you the quality of that  right on the fly instead of having to bring it back  to the lab and count the number  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:07):**  and measure them and weigh them.  So it's just at the very early stages  of the marriage of biology and other technology.  So it's a very exciting time to be in agriculture  and a really great time to be a farmer, I think,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:24):**  and a great time to be an entrepreneur.  So if you're a young person coming out of school  and you're wondering what to do,  there's more opportunities to actually solve problems  by starting up a company  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:36):**  and being an entrepreneur than ever before.  I completely agree with that.  It is a very exciting time to be in agriculture.  There is a rapidly growing understanding  of all of the ecosystem interactions.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:47):**  We are able to make correlations and links  that we haven't been able to before.  I know that one of the pieces I find personally  very fulfilling is being able to predict disease  and insect susceptibility  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:01):**  based on a plant's nutritional profile,  which is something that we've been working with.  And so completely agree.  Very exciting technology that is emerging  on many different fronts.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:09):**  And I believe that agriculture and food and crop production  is going to look fundamentally different  in 15 years from now.  To a point that you made earlier,  I agree that nutritional solutions and biocontrols,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:25):**  biostimulants will be the first tools of choice  and pesticides and synthetic fertilizers  will be applied on an as needed, where needed basis.  And we'll have the tools to be able to manage  and measure that very accurately  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:38):**  and very well in the future.  Yep, I think that's where we're going.  And it's my dream of seeing ecologically based agriculture  be the dominant way we farm.  It's exciting.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:53):**  I wish I were younger.  I could start up three more companies  because I think it will take about 15 years,  but that's the exciting future we see.  Very good times.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:05):**  Pam, thank you very much for joining us  and for sharing your thoughts with our growers  and our audience.  And we look forward to speaking with you again soon.  Thank you, John.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:14):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:32):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant  to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  we must first think differently about agriculture,  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:48):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  that help growers produce higher quality yield  and make more money with less risk.  Thank you for listening.

**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:31):**  Hi friends, I'm here with Pam Marrone,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:34):**  an exceptional entrepreneur who's done quite a bit  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:37):**  of intriguing work in the area of bio pesticides  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:40):**  and bio stimulants.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:41):**  Pam, you've had a very interesting pathway in life,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:44):**  working with your degree at Cornell,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:46):**  working for Monsanto and Entotec, your work at AgriQuest,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:51):**  most recently at Marrone BioInnovations.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:53):**  You've had a fascinating pathway,  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:55):**  I've found it very intriguing.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:57):**  Can you tell us a little bit about the journey  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:01:59):**  that you've been on and what has brought you to the point  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:02):**  that you are today and the things that you're working on?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:04):**  Sure, I started from way back, oh gosh,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:08):**  when I was a little girl growing up in rural Connecticut.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:11):**  And I watched the gypsy moths ravage the trees  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:15):**  and my father ended up using BT, bacillus thuringiensis,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:20):**  which was the first ever microbial bio insecticide  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:23):**  commercialized and he was trying to save some,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:26):**  a dogwood tree right outside the kitchen window.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:27):**  And it was intriguing to me that there was this  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:32):**  naturally occurring microbe that could control caterpillars.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:35):**  And I was seven, eight, nine years old  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:37):**  when he was using that product.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:39):**  So I was determined to become an entomologist  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:42):**  and then look for ways to control pests naturally.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:46):**  That was what I decided I was gonna do.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:48):**  And so I started at Monsanto  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:50):**  and had a very non-traditional career there.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:52):**  I was hired to start up a unit looking for ways  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:02:56):**  to control insects without the use of chemicals.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:00):**  And this was before that was right  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:02):**  when the GMO stuff was happening.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:04):**  So I set up a natural product screening  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:07):**  where we screened over 150,000 microorganisms  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:10):**  looking for natural products.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:12):**  And they cut that program of course,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:14):**  and ended up in shifting me to work on GMOs.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:18):**  And I got a call from a Danish company I'd never heard of,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:21):**  Novo Nordisk, who said they wanted me to start up a company  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:24):**  in the United States somewhere,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:26):**  which we ended up Davis, California,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:28):**  screening microbes looking for natural products.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:30):**  And I was like, whoa,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:31):**  I get to continue what I really love to do.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:33):**  I fell in love with screening for natural products  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:36):**  and looking for natural products for controlling pests.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:39):**  So moved to Davis and then my group screen,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:41):**  meaning isolated and discovered and tested against pests,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:46):**  another 55,000 microbes.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:49):**  And then Novo Nordisk decided to sell us  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:52):**  just when we were starting to really get some headway.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:55):**  They sold us to our largest competitor,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:03:57):**  which is now Valen Biosciences.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:00):**  And I left and started up AgriQuest in 1995.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:04):**  And then we screened another 22,000 microbes,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:08):**  came up with a line of biofungicides,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:11):**  which are now very well known, Serenade and Sonata,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:14):**  and then started this one in 2006.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:16):**  And the idea with this company was to find microbes  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:21):**  and plant extracts across the full range of grower needs.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:24):**  So not just fungicides, but also insect control,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:28):**  nematode control, plant health and stress reduction,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:32):**  and ultimately weed control.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:34):**  And weed control has been the toughest,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:37):**  but we're working on it and making headway.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:39):**  So that's the nature of my career.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:41):**  And yeah, it's unique in starting up companies  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:44):**  and being able to follow biopesticides,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:47):**  biocontrol all the way through.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:49):**  Pam, you described some very memorable moments.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:52):**  I find it very intriguing where we get inspiration  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:54):**  for our life's work.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:56):**  And so one of the questions that I have for you  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:04:58):**  is throughout your pathway,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:01):**  what have been some of the memorable moments  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:03):**  when you look back, what are some of the things  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:04):**  that really stand out to you that were unexpected,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:09):**  that came as a surprise?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:10):**  Well, certainly each time I started with the R&D groups  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:16):**  we had started screening, the number of things we found  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:21):**  that were pesticides was amazing.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:25):**  And yet there were so few, if you look at the numbers,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:29):**  only 15% of pesticides are derived from natural sources,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:34):**  but more than 50% of your drugs.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:36):**  So each time we found all these discoveries and said,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:40):**  wow, the natural world is full of these things,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:43):**  but why have so few made it to market?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:46):**  And so each time I set up these groups,  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:50):**  what we found was that you can find a needle  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:54):**  in a haystack, certainly, you can search the world,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:05:57):**  but as you gain knowledge over time, you can find,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:02):**  what's really interesting was that you can actually see  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:04):**  patterns in nature.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:05):**  So like, where can you find a microorganism  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:10):**  that kills insects versus a microorganism  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:12):**  that kills plant diseases?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:14):**  Well, they're interestingly different sources.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:17):**  So we found that finding an insecticidal microbe,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:20):**  you had a higher chance if you looked like in conifer litter  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:25):**  under conifer trees or rotting stumps,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:29):**  whereas with looking for fungicidal microbes,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:32):**  dry creek beds were really good sources,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:35):**  also isolating from the surface of the plant  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:37):**  or the roots, as you might expect.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:40):**  There's these patterns in nature that you can sort out  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:42):**  over time as you become expert in these things.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:47):**  The conversation has really shifted around the biocontrols  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:50):**  and biostimulants and just the plant microbiome in general,  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:53):**  even 10 years ago in mainstream agriculture,  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:56):**  there was at least in my observation experience,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:06:59):**  very little dialogue around a plant microbiome.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:03):**  And today that conversation has dramatically shifted  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:08):**  where there's a lot of discussion in the areas  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:11):**  of biostimulants and biocontrol,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:13):**  something that you've been leading in  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:15):**  for your entire career.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:16):**  Yeah, it's remarkable that there's been a shift now  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:19):**  and it's very exciting to see  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:21):**  because the basis for organic farming, as you know,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:25):**  is a healthy soil equals a healthy plant.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:27):**  So organic farmers have had the focus on microbial  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:32):**  biodiversity in the soil and healthy soil for a long time,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:36):**  but now there's healthy soil initiatives  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:38):**  for conventional farmers, which is great to see  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:41):**  because then that leads to a healthier plant  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:44):**  if you have a healthier soil,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:45):**  regardless of whether you're organic or conventional.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:48):**  And so I, yes, I was way ahead of my time,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:51):**  but now it's interesting to see  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:52):**  that this is becoming mainstream.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:55):**  I was just at a Rockefeller funded  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:07:57):**  and OECD funded think tank in Italy  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:02):**  two weeks ago and we had the top researchers  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:05):**  in the microbiome for plants  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:07):**  and natural products researchers there  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:10):**  giving their talks about what they've learned.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:12):**  And now with the modern tools of genomics  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:16):**  and also your molecular tools, gene editing and so forth,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:20):**  you can find out much faster what's happening  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:23):**  with the microbiome on the plant  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:25):**  and also what plants are producing  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:27):**  in terms of natural products.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:29):**  So you can sort out better what's happening in the soil  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:31):**  and on the plant.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:33):**  It's not easy because there was one researcher  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:36):**  who's found that the microbiome on the roots changed  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:42):**  depending on whether the land,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:44):**  it was wheat, was irrigated or not.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:46):**  And they found different microbes shifting from,  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:50):**  you could actually shift the microbes  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:51):**  depending on whether you're irrigated or not.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:53):**  And then when you were in the transition of irrigating  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:55):**  from dry land to irrigation, you changed them.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:08:58):**  You had a shift sort of in between microbiome.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:01):**  So while these modern tools of molecular biology  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:04):**  and such are really helping,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:06):**  there's still a lot of complex patterns in nature  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:08):**  that we don't understand,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:09):**  which we will understand more and more over time.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:12):**  I think the comment that you just made  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:13):**  around shifting the microbiome is very relevant  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:16):**  to a conversation which is gaining a lot more awareness  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:21):**  is the desire to create or develop a disease-suppressive  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:24):**  soil and understanding that if we really want to develop  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:27):**  a disease-suppressive soil microbial community  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:29):**  and soil microbiome, then that's really a conversation  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:32):**  about shifting the soil environment  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:34):**  and the macro environment.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:36):**  It is, and this researcher, her name is Linda Tamashow,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:39):**  and she's a USDA researcher in Pullman, Washington.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:42):**  She studied the suppressive soil of wheat over time  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:46):**  and why in some fields take all disease declines,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:50):**  but it was a long-term shift.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:52):**  So it didn't happen overnight.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:54):**  And interestingly, everyone assumes that it's a cocktail  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:09:58):**  of microbes or a consortium of microbes  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:00):**  that causes the suppressive soil.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:03):**  In her case, she found that it actually was one  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:06):**  natural compound that was excreted  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:09):**  by the taxonomic group of microbes  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:11):**  that was causing the reduction in take-all.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:14):**  Really was the primary effect was one single metabolite.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:18):**  So there are these things, these rules now,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:21):**  I'm hearing farmers say,  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:22):**  well, I gotta have a consortia to have the suppressive soil.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:25):**  And she found that wasn't necessarily true.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:28):**  So interestingly, there could be a dominant player  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:32):**  or there could be a consortia.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:33):**  So again, no rules really apply yet.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:36):**  We're still learning about this.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:39):**  You mentioned a moment ago that 50% of pharmaceutical drugs  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:43):**  are bio-derived if I understood you correctly.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:46):**  Right.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:47):**  And a much smaller percentage of the agricultural pesticides  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:51):**  and agricultural chemicals are bio-derived.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:54):**  One of the questions that I sometimes hear is,  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:57):**  growers are asking the question,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:10:58):**  what are the systemic advantages  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:01):**  or what are the advantages to the overall ecosystem  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:03):**  of using biocontrols as compared to using synthetic,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:09):**  pharmaceutical grade or pharmaceutical quality pesticides?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:12):**  Well, one thing is that the biopesticides  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:16):**  or bio control microorganisms or extracts of plants  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:19):**  tend to be more biodegradable.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:22):**  So they break down much more quickly.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:24):**  And because you can't hook synthetic groups to them,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:27):**  so you're a lot of modern chemicals,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:29):**  you can make them more persistent by hooking on bromines  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:33):**  or halogen compounds.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:36):**  And so one of the advantages  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:37):**  and also disadvantage is biodegradability,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:40):**  but that is an advantage.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:42):**  And also, so they don't affect the existing microbiome  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:46):**  as much or also the beneficial organisms on the plant,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:51):**  honeybees, lacewings, lady beetles,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:53):**  the predatory mites, most biologicals  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:11:56):**  are generally non-toxic or low risk  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:00):**  to your non-target organisms.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:03):**  So for in terms of developing a system,  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:06):**  a holistic system, that's really a benefit.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:10):**  And also because of the complex modes of action  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:13):**  of most biologicals,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:15):**  you don't have the resistance developing.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:17):**  Most modern chemicals today have a single side of action.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:20):**  So the pests and pathogens can develop or weeds  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:24):**  can develop quite quickly.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:26):**  And that's not the case with 99% of the biologicals.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:29):**  There's only a couple of cases globally in 70 years  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:32):**  where pests have developed resistance  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:35):**  to biological pesticides.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:37):**  So that durability, sustainability.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:39):**  The other thing is that biologicals,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:42):**  whether it be a biopesticide or biostimulant  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:44):**  are generally produced with agricultural raw materials.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:49):**  So for example, our products are made in fermentation.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:53):**  So we put soy flour in the media  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:12:57):**  when we make the microbe and other natural raw materials.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:01):**  So, and then our waste is also all biodegradable  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:07):**  natural waste product from the agricultural raw materials.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:11):**  So the whole process of making the product is,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:16):**  I would say sustainable in terms of the definition  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:19):**  because of its ingredients and biodegradability.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:26):**  I think one of the key pieces  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:27):**  that we are beginning to understand better  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:30):**  is the need to develop whole farm systems.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:36):**  And I know that many growers are expressing a strong desire  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:41):**  to develop a cropping system  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:43):**  where they have a reduced dependency on pesticides.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:47):**  And we have a challenge of course, on the research side  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:50):**  in terms of product validation, et cetera,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:52):**  where research is primarily focused  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:55):**  on single factor analysis  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:13:56):**  rather than a multi-factor analysis or systems analysis.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:00):**  What hurdles have you encountered with the adoption  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:05):**  or the validation of biocontrols in that research context?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:12):**  This is such a timely topic question you just asked.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:16):**  I've had a lot of discussion over this  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:18):**  over the last three months.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:20):**  And this was a keen topic of the think tank I was in Italy.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:24):**  It's come up when talking to regulators,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:27):**  when there's regulatory action or court action  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:30):**  to remove a chemical pesticide.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:32):**  And then indeed I was down  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:33):**  with one of the largest citrus growers in Florida recently  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:37):**  talking about sustainable solutions  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:38):**  for controlling citrus greening and Asian citrus psyllid.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:42):**  And that can certainly be applied to California  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:43):**  where we're getting some outbreaks of that.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:46):**  And everyone in these conversations agreed  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:49):**  with what you just said.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:50):**  And that is university research is very reductionist.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:54):**  It's single factor.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:55):**  So you'll test one single biological  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:14:58):**  against the chemical program.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:00):**  It might even be chemical cocktail  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:02):**  whereas you're testing a single biological against that.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:05):**  And you're not looking at the whole system  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:07):**  or developing a whole IPM program.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:09):**  And the farmers are saying,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:11):**  there's no longer silver bullets anymore.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:13):**  There's no silver bullet for replacing methyl bromide.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:17):**  The interim solutions,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:19):**  the chemical fumigants are just that interim.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:21):**  They're gonna be restricted over time.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:24):**  The same with Asian citrus psyllid.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:26):**  There's no single bullet.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:27):**  So why is the funding going more towards  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:31):**  either very long-term basic research  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:35):**  or single factor research instead of whole system research?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:40):**  There needs to be funding from the various agencies  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:43):**  whether it's USDA, NIFA or where else  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:45):**  to fund on-farm holistic IPM programs.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:51):**  And that's where the gap is missing  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:54):**  because who's around to actually develop  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:56):**  a multi-factor system where you're implementing  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:15:59):**  all the tools.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:01):**  It's cultural, it's variety selection, it's soil health,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:04):**  it's other cultural tools enhancing your biologicals  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:07):**  or multiple, it might not just be one chemical  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:10):**  but multiple solutions.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:12):**  And so, but who's doing that?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:15):**  And is there money for it?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:17):**  I think you're absolutely right  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:19):**  is that we need to be doing that  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:20):**  because the reality is that is how natural ecosystems work.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:24):**  That's how farmers are forced to work.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:26):**  And so in order for research to be applicable,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:31):**  it really needs to be multi-factorial.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:33):**  That's right.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:35):**  That's right.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:36):**  And that's where there's a big gap.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:38):**  And I'm increasingly hearing that from farmers  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:40):**  over and over and over again.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:42):**  We need a multi-factor solutions on the farm  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:44):**  in a holistic system.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:46):**  And while it's nice to look at insecticide fungicide reports  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:51):**  and see the single factor efficacy trials  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:54):**  from the land grant institutions,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:56):**  I need more than that because the silver bullets,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:16:59):**  you can't use them as silver bullets anymore.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:02):**  You'll get resistance.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:03):**  Some of them are restricted already regulatory wise  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:06):**  so you can't use them as much.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:07):**  You have limits on the number of sprays you can use.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:10):**  So how are these gonna be incorporated in  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:13):**  and enhancing my beneficials, improving my soil health.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:17):**  Down in the citrus, talking to the large grower,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:21):**  there were definite differences and tolerances  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:23):**  of the different citrus varieties to the citrus greening.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:27):**  And that's where it starts.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:29):**  Pam, you've helped found or a leading founder  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:33):**  of the Bioproducts Industry Alliance.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:35):**  And we spoke a moment ago about the shifting discussion  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:40):**  and conversation that is happening  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:41):**  in the agriculture space around biocontrols.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:44):**  In the conversations that I have with growers,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:45):**  I see many growers have a strong desire for biocontrols.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:49):**  Agronomists want to understand how to use them better.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:52):**  And then we of course historically have had  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:55):**  some regulatory challenges getting products  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:57):**  to be approved in the marketplace.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:17:58):**  One of the questions that I know many listeners  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:01):**  have a strong interest in is where's the future?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:05):**  How do you see the use of biocontrols  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:08):**  and biopesticides evolving in the future  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:10):**  as compared to industry development  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:13):**  of pharmaceutical quality pesticides?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:16):**  Well, the market is growing faster  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:19):**  for biologicals than for chemicals.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:21):**  So the chemical pesticide market is relatively flat,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:24):**  a single digit growth,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:25):**  whereas biologicals is growing between 15 and 20%.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:29):**  So clearly something is happening.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:31):**  And what's happening?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:33):**  Both organic and conventional growers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:35):**  are adopting these at a more rapid rate.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:38):**  And they're learning how to use them better.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:40):**  But that's the key is first of all, awareness.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:43):**  Our surveys show that a lot of farmers  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:47):**  still are completely unaware of the category  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:50):**  and unaware of the products available.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:52):**  Number two is how to use them.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:54):**  Because the modes of action of these products are unique  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:57):**  and often very different from chemicals,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:18:59):**  it is a higher education and it's not do they work,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:02):**  it's how to make them work  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:04):**  and how to make them work in integrated programs.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:06):**  Going back to that single factor analysis,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:09):**  you'll see reams of data from university researchers  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:12):**  showing about pesticide  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:14):**  against the best cocktail of chemicals.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:15):**  And then maybe it's not quite as good,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:18):**  so it doesn't get used.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:19):**  But then that's such a shame  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:21):**  because when it's integrated into a program,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:24):**  it might be a rotation or a tank mixture,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:28):**  then the biologicals will make the whole program better.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:31):**  So it's really understanding how to use.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:34):**  And that is a gap we see also  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:36):**  who's doing that educational piece.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:39):**  So it falls to the companies like ours,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:41):**  but really there needs to be a lot more education.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:44):**  It is changing at the land grants  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:45):**  as some of the older researchers retire  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:48):**  and new ones come in  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:49):**  and they're generally more open  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:51):**  to really learning how to use these products  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:53):**  and really helping the growers learn how to use them.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:56):**  Cornell, it's a shining example.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:19:58):**  I was at the Geneva Research Farm this summer  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:01):**  now called Cornell AgriTech.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:03):**  And there's a professor, Dr. Cox, who said,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:05):**  I think I'm gonna be able to develop  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:07):**  an all biological system for controlling fire blight  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:10):**  that works just as well as antibiotics and copper,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:12):**  which are both undesirable  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:14):**  from the environmental standpoint.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:16):**  So you're seeing that generational change  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:20):**  in being able to help the farmer understand  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:24):**  how to integrate these and use them,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:25):**  which is how they're best used.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:29):**  Pam, this next question is a question  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:30):**  that I've asked many of the guests  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:33):**  who joined me here on the podcast  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:36):**  with many intriguing responses.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:37):**  What is something that you believe to be true  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:40):**  about modern agriculture that is perhaps different  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:44):**  from the mainstream viewpoint?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:50):**  She pauses.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:51):**  I'm not thinking about that one.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:20:58):**  Well, there may be a belief that you always will need  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:02):**  to use chemicals in every case.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:05):**  And ultimately the way you look at agriculture today  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:11):**  is dominated by chemicals,  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:14):**  and then you dial in biologicals only when needed.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:17):**  Okay, what you can see in the future  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:20):**  is that you rely on this holistic system  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:23):**  we're talking about integrating all the cultural tools  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:27):**  of true IPM.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:28):**  You incorporate all the cultural tools,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:30):**  plant health, soil health, biologicals,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:32):**  and then you use chemicals only when needed.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:35):**  So you turn it, you flip it.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:38):**  And I think that there's already a model system for that.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:43):**  So when Azanfos methyl, guthion was banned,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:46):**  restricted for controlling codling moth in apples,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:51):**  pears, and nuts on the West Coast here,  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:21:55):**  it created a crisis and a consortium of growers  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:00):**  and University of California  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:02):**  formed the Randall Island Project,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:04):**  and they were determined to find alternate way  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:07):**  to control codling moth.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:09):**  And there weren't any chemicals coming along at the time.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:12):**  So they relied on pheromones  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:14):**  and ended up in a wide area pheromone program,  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:19):**  developing pheromones as the basis  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:23):**  for controlling codling moth,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:25):**  and then you only dialed in chemicals when needed.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:27):**  So there's a perfect example  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:29):**  of when you have public private partnership,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:31):**  you can develop a system, a sustainable system,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:35):**  where it's robust, sustainably, long lasting,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:40):**  and economically viable for the growers.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:43):**  There are many other examples where that could be done.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:47):**  And so we are shifting  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:49):**  to a more ecologically based program over time.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:54):**  Pam, in the work that you have done,  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:56):**  working with ecosystems,  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:58):**  developing these biocontrol products  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:22:59):**  over the last number of decades,  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:02):**  what has been something that came as a pleasant surprise?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:06):**  What was unexpected?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:07):**  The amazing diversity of things.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:12):**  You could find a solution to any problem in nature.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:18):**  So if you wanna control a pest,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:21):**  you can find a natural solution to control that pest,  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:25):**  if you look enough and know where to look.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:28):**  So we actually did that here at Meron Bio.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:32):**  So we said, we heard over and over and over again  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:35):**  that the pathogens, plant disease causing pathogens  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:39):**  were constantly developing resistance  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:42):**  to various downy mildews.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:43):**  And the growers said both the chemical  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:46):**  and biological solutions for downy mildews,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:50):**  like lettuce downy mildew, grape downy mildew,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:52):**  were just not good enough and they needed more tools.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:55):**  So we went and said, okay,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:23:57):**  we're gonna find a solution specifically  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:00):**  to oomycetes or the downy mildews.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:02):**  And we screened 16,000 microbes looking for a solution.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:07):**  And lo and behold, we had some candidates  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:10):**  and we commercialized one.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:11):**  So there's just an example of,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:13):**  and we've done that multiple times.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:15):**  We did the same with, we're gonna look for a solution  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:17):**  for controlling this nematode.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:19):**  And so that can continue  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:22):**  because of the amazing diversity of microorganisms  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:27):**  and also not just the microorganism itself,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:30):**  but the byproducts of the microorganisms.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:33):**  So the microorganisms produce compounds  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:35):**  that control pests and plant pathogens and even weeds.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:39):**  And the diversity of,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:42):**  just like penicillin comes from a mold,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:44):**  the diversity of those compounds is also,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:47):**  in many ways, just amazing.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:49):**  And I don't know if it was unexpected, but it is amazing.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:52):**  We keep finding novel compounds that are new  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:56):**  and never known and never not discovered before.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:24:58):**  Same, we found several new species of bacteria.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:02):**  And so I think there's just so much more out there.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:05):**  We're just in the very early stages  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:07):**  of harnessing the natural world out there,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:10):**  both the plant natural products, microorganisms,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:14):**  and the compounds they produce.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:16):**  I find that perspective to be so intriguing.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:21):**  There's so much that we still don't know,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:23):**  and yet we also have learned a lot.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:25):**  So there's obviously tremendous value  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:26):**  and a lot of benefit in developing products,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:29):**  such as you have been developing with various companies,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:32):**  that growers can use.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:34):**  But there is also,  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:35):**  I think we also have to ask the question,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:37):**  how much of these various microbes  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:41):**  and the beneficial value they bring  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:44):**  can we tap into simply by managing ecosystems?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:46):**  Yep.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:47):**  Can we produce those same benefits  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:49):**  and those same effects by managing our ecosystems  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:51):**  rather than focusing on a single product?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:54):**  What are your thoughts?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:54):**  I do think that's the basis  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:56):**  for a whole crop production system.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:25:59):**  That's where we ultimately will get to.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:02):**  And that is the basis for organic agriculture.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:04):**  As you know, organic farmers use a lot fewer inputs.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:07):**  And why?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:08):**  They have a healthier ecosystem, more biodiversity,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:11):**  so the pests and diseases don't outbreak as much.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:14):**  But occasionally you're gonna need some,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:15):**  so they do use tools.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:17):**  But ultimately, yes,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:19):**  as you enhance the soil, enhance the microbiome,  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:23):**  and understand what's going on,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:25):**  interactions with weather and soil type and crop variety,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:29):**  and it is complex,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:30):**  ultimately you can develop, like I said before,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:34):**  a whole base of your system is ecologically based,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:38):**  and then you only add inputs when you need them.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:41):**  And organic farmers,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:43):**  that's the whole basis of organic farming philosophy,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:46):**  sometimes not always practiced that way,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:48):**  but anyway, that is,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:49):**  and certainly conventional farmers  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:51):**  are moving in that direction.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:54):**  Pam, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:58):**  What do I wish all farmers knew?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:26:59):**  I'm gonna be very selfish in that one.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:01):**  There's a lingering perception  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:05):**  that biologicals are weaker than chemicals in performance.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:11):**  And it's actually not true,  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:13):**  because when you incorporate them into the program,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:17):**  they can actually strengthen  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:20):**  and enhance the entire pest management  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:23):**  or crop production program.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:24):**  So I wish that growers would look at integrated programs  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:28):**  instead of just single factor analysis  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:31):**  when it comes to looking at biologicals.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:34):**  I would like farmers to start from the basis  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:37):**  that these products do work,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:39):**  but it's how to make them work rather than,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:42):**  oh, they're weaker.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:45):**  Well, I can certainly second that.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:47):**  And I can speak from experience  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:50):**  on many different types of crops,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:53):**  many different types of operations  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:54):**  where biologicals and biocontrols  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:57):**  have been successful,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:27:59):**  where chemical controls were unsuccessful.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:02):**  So they have the capacity to be incredibly effective,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:05):**  I think partially because of the broad range  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:07):**  of mode of actions.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:08):**  There are so many more modes of action  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:10):**  than they're sometimes present with pesticides.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:13):**  And I think from my observation, my perspective,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:16):**  when they are used as a part of a management system,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:20):**  in many cases, they can be equally  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:23):**  or sometimes even more effective  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:24):**  than their pesticide counterparts.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:27):**  Yes, and that is the key when used  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:28):**  as part of the management system.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:31):**  And that the problem is, as we said earlier,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:33):**  that the testing is done in a reductionist way  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:38):**  rather than integrated as part of the management program.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:41):**  And so we have to encourage researchers  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:44):**  or fund the research to go to the next step  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:47):**  in the land grant system.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:48):**  So it's more like how the farmers  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:51):**  use the products on the farm.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:53):**  So Pam, if you wanted to advise a grower or a farmer  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:28:58):**  where to get more information,  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:00):**  what resources or what books would you recommend  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:02):**  to growers who want to learn more about biocontrols  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:05):**  and biosimilants, the products that are available  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:06):**  and how they might be able to use them?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:08):**  Well, ATRA is a good place,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:11):**  the Association for Responsible Technology.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:13):**  They do have a lot of information  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:16):**  and they do have a database where you can search  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:18):**  and get info.

**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:22):**  does have a searchable database.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:26):**  And the BioProducts Industry Alliance  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:28):**  has information on the website  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:31):**  about these types of products.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:33):**  I have started a BioBytes section on our website  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:39):**  where I have cataloged a number of articles I've written,  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:43):**  other people's articles on this topic,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:45):**  as well as some of the previous podcasts I've done.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:49):**  So that's another resource.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:51):**  Thanks for sharing those.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:53):**  And for those of you listening,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:54):**  we will link to the various resources  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:56):**  that Pam has shared in the podcast description as well,  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:29:58):**  that you can follow those links very easily.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:01):**  Pam, what is a question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:05):**  Well, we didn't talk about some of the other benefits  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:09):**  of biological programs.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:12):**  We focused on the ecologically based part of it  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:15):**  and whole systems approach,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:16):**  but there are other factors that can really be benefits.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:20):**  So for example, in tight times of immigrant farm labor,  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:25):**  where some farmers I know  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:26):**  are having a tough time getting workers,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:28):**  you wanna manage your labor better.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:31):**  And so you can spray in the morning  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:33):**  and be back in the field with the biological products  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:35):**  because of their safety level.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:37):**  So that's a real benefit.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:38):**  And then when a lot of farmers export  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:41):**  and they export to foreign markets,  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:43):**  and a lot of these foreign markets  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:45):**  are not accepting the US levels of pesticide residues  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:48):**  and going beyond the US levels,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:50):**  and so have either none or lower levels.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:53):**  So biologically you can spray  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:54):**  and right at the end of the season  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:56):**  and you don't leave any residues.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:30:59):**  The other thing I'll mention is that  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:01):**  what we're seeing is that there's new technology  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:05):**  in terms of sensors, software, robotics, drones,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:11):**  all kinds of technology, hardware and software, digital ag,  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:16):**  that's being applied to crop production and pest management  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:20):**  so that there's gonna be leaps and bounds made  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:22):**  in understanding the microbiome  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:24):**  and soil health and plant health.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:26):**  But at the same time,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:28):**  there's going to be better ways to track pest populations  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:34):**  through remote sensing,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:36):**  making it more efficient to be able to learn  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:39):**  how to integrate biologicals  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:40):**  and predict when you have to spray or not.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:44):**  So modeling when a disease comes in  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:47):**  or when a pest comes in.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:49):**  So for example,  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:50):**  I know that there's some postdoc at UC Davis  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:31:53):**  who was modeling the movement of ligus from major crops.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:00):**  So when they cut alfalfa,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:02):**  that certainly makes sense that when the alfalfa's cut,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:05):**  the ligus bugs don't have any place to go,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:07):**  so they then move into a crop nearby  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:09):**  and then they devastate whether it's strawberries  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:12):**  or peppers or what have you.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:13):**  So there's gonna be a lot more things happening  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:17):**  where growers are gonna be able to have a lot more tools  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:21):**  to be able to predict pest populations  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:23):**  and what's actually happening on the farm.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:25):**  So you'll be able to have little video systems  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:28):**  to watch the insect, the aphids right out in the farm  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:31):**  and digital imaging where you know  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:33):**  after a certain crop production method,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:36):**  you'll be able to see whether what you're doing  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:39):**  is enhancing the,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:41):**  you don't have to wait for the whole season  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:42):**  and then measure yield,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:43):**  you'll be able to see it through imaging much sooner.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:47):**  There's a company called Ag Shift  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:49):**  that is using artificial intelligence  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:52):**  to develop an iPhone app  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:55):**  where you can just snap a photo of your crop,  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:32:58):**  the actual fruit or nut,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:00):**  and then it will tell you the quality of that  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:03):**  right on the fly instead of having to bring it back  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:05):**  to the lab and count the number  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:07):**  and measure them and weigh them.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:09):**  So it's just at the very early stages  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:13):**  of the marriage of biology and other technology.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:17):**  So it's a very exciting time to be in agriculture  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:20):**  and a really great time to be a farmer, I think,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:24):**  and a great time to be an entrepreneur.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:26):**  So if you're a young person coming out of school  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:29):**  and you're wondering what to do,  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:31):**  there's more opportunities to actually solve problems  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:35):**  by starting up a company  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:36):**  and being an entrepreneur than ever before.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:38):**  I completely agree with that.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:40):**  It is a very exciting time to be in agriculture.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:42):**  There is a rapidly growing understanding  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:45):**  of all of the ecosystem interactions.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:47):**  We are able to make correlations and links  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:51):**  that we haven't been able to before.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:53):**  I know that one of the pieces I find personally  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:55):**  very fulfilling is being able to predict disease  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:33:59):**  and insect susceptibility  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:01):**  based on a plant's nutritional profile,  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:02):**  which is something that we've been working with.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:04):**  And so completely agree.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:06):**  Very exciting technology that is emerging  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:08):**  on many different fronts.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:09):**  And I believe that agriculture and food and crop production  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:14):**  is going to look fundamentally different  
**[0:34:16-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:16):**  in 15 years from now.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:18):**  To a point that you made earlier,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:20):**  I agree that nutritional solutions and biocontrols,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:25):**  biostimulants will be the first tools of choice  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:29):**  and pesticides and synthetic fertilizers  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:32):**  will be applied on an as needed, where needed basis.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:34):**  And we'll have the tools to be able to manage  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:36):**  and measure that very accurately  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:38):**  and very well in the future.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:41):**  Yep, I think that's where we're going.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:43):**  And it's my dream of seeing ecologically based agriculture  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:48):**  be the dominant way we farm.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:52):**  It's exciting.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:53):**  I wish I were younger.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:55):**  I could start up three more companies  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:34:56):**  because I think it will take about 15 years,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:00):**  but that's the exciting future we see.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:04):**  Very good times.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:05):**  Pam, thank you very much for joining us  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/biocontrols-for-the-future-with-pam-marrone/#t=0:35:07):**  and for sharing your thoughts with our growers

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 26 May 2020 12:23:22)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, welcome back to the regenerative agriculture podcast. Today I'm delighted and  
**[0:00:06-0:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:06):**  honored to have Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms in Virginia here with us. Joel Salatin is a voice  
**[0:00:13-0:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:13):**  and a name that scarcely needs an introduction. He has been a voice of inspiration to very many.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:21):**  Joel, thank you for being here and for sharing your wisdom and your inspiration as widely as  
**[0:00:26-0:00:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:26):**  you have over the years. One of the questions that I was asked to ask you is one of your strengths is  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:34):**  that you're very articulate and able to describe your ideas and positions well to other people.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:42):**  How can other farmers learn that skill? Generally if a farmer is filling out a job description,  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:48):**  nowhere on that job description will it say storytelling ability or communication skills.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:00:56):**  You know it'll be things like managing animals or keeping good records,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:05):**  you know being able to repair things.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:07):**  Seldom do you see communication on there and so I've been blessed when I was through school,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:19):**  competing in forensics and debate, theater, drama. I was always in the school plays and  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:26):**  especially the debate team and learning to communicate and speak. I mean clearly  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:31):**  I have a gift for that but it's a gift that's been honed and I think this is what's important  
**[0:01:38-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:38):**  that you may not become the most gifted orator but you can develop at least some rudimentary skills  
**[0:01:46-0:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:46):**  whether you take a couple of writing courses or join the local theater group. There's the  
**[0:01:54-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:01:54):**  international speakers, non-profit called Toastmasters and their whole deal is their local  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:02):**  chapters all over the country, Toastmasters and what they do is they teach communication and  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:09):**  speaking skills and you do little short vignettes, different kinds of little talks. People critique  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:14):**  you and you know you work at it. The truth is that people who are not familiar with the  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:20):**  world, who learn to communicate in any field become the pace setters, kind of the leaders  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:29):**  in that field. You don't have to be the best but if you can tell the story the best,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:35):**  you'll be considered an expert, you'll have an audience. People don't know I practice speeches  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:42):**  in front of a mirror, you know I give them to myself in the mirror and you you know you're  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:46):**  in front of a mirror you know I give them to myself in the mirror and you practice your timing  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:02:52):**  and you practice your words and then I read a lot. Farmers tend to not be readers and  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:00):**  I would encourage just immersing yourself in a broad range of things. You know keep up on  
**[0:03:05-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:05):**  current events, read the old philosophy, read you know everything from Malabar Farm and  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:13):**  Lewis Promfield to Ed Faulkner and Plowman's Folly and Wendell Berry and immerse yourself  
**[0:03:19-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:19):**  in the language of, I mean I'm not encouraging people to read Norman Borlaug literature,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:28):**  but know who the players are and people who know stuff, history, current events,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:39):**  signs of the times, trends, people who know stuff or make interesting conversationalists.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:45):**  I'm a voracious reader, an eclectic reader. I read everything from business to philosophy to  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:50):**  religion to whatever marketing, self-help, whatever and read things that I don't agree with  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:03:56):**  because you need to understand what other what other people are thinking, get in their heads so  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:02):**  you know better how to articulate. These are all things that you can do to cultivate your own  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:08):**  awareness and interestingness and as you cultivate that you'll become someone people enjoy  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:15):**  conversing with and listening to simply because you'll be able to have a better grasp of the  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:23):**  subject matter. I seem to recall somewhere in one of your books you wrote that I think the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:29):**  topic was on organic certification in general, you wrote that rather than certifying the process  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:35):**  that a farm uses perhaps we should begin certifying their bookshelves. Yes I've said that  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:40):**  more times than once. Unfortunately government organic certification at least has become a bit  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:47):**  of a you know a little checklist of do's and don'ts. You know we understand that it's more  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:04:54):**  than just a list of do's and don'ts, it's an embrace of a of a worldview of a way we view  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:00):**  life and the way the world works. I'm not talking about politics, I'm talking about  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:08):**  basic ecological function. You know the deep soils on the planet were not built with 10 10 10  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:14):**  chemical fertilizer and they were built with carbon solar you know real-time solar energy  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:20):**  converted to carbon and vegetation that rots or is eaten and manured in place. You know these are  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:28):**  the great principles and it's a mindset, it's a worldview and yeah I have said numerous times what  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:34):**  we ought to be looking for is you know what's on the magazine rack behind the toilet and what's on  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:38):**  the bookshelf. That actually indicates where a person's mind is because where you're you know  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:43):**  where your mind where your mental treasure is you know that's where your heart will be. You mentioned  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:48):**  that you read books that you don't agree with and something I've been thinking about recently  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:53):**  there's this quote from not Warren Buffett but his business partner Charlie Munger. I'm paraphrasing  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:05:59):**  a bit but essentially he's saying you're not qualified to have an opinion until you can  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:05):**  articulate the opposing viewpoint better than the opposition. I think if we followed that  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:10):**  perspective there would be a lot fewer opinions in the world most likely. Yes that's true and you  
**[0:06:17-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:17):**  know on that point if I may swerve just a bit to this this is one reason why I don't pick at  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:26):**  McDonald's or write nasty letters about making GMOs illegal or closing down Monsanto or any of  
**[0:06:34-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:34):**  these other efforts because I unlike many of the folk my friends in this ecology movement I think  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:44):**  I think that the people who disagree with us are not evil intended. I think they are misguided.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:51):**  I think they're ignorant and I think they're wrong but to denigrate the folks who live who work at  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:06:59):**  Monsanto as evil intended is a very different situation. I mean my neighbor here in Swope  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:07):**  physical neighbor is the mid-Atlantic sales rep for Monsanto. We couldn't be more divergent in  
**[0:07:17-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:17):**  how we view the way food and farming and ecology function you know in the living dynamics of the  
**[0:07:26-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:26):**  soil and plant community but he really believes he's a good person. He really believes that he is  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:38):**  feeding the world saving the saving the planet from whatever stupidity and starvation and famine  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:45):**  and you have to honor that as soon as you assume that these big bad corporations are and the people  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:07:54):**  who run them the people who make glyphosate or whatever that they are ogres and evil intended  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:00):**  and you conceive of them in your mind as some sort of a devil or a demon you suddenly a shut  
**[0:08:08-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:08):**  yourself off from ever making a bridge with them and number two you actually hurt your own ability  
**[0:08:17-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:17):**  to step into the marketplace of ideas with something that's helpful because it prejudices  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:26):**  your mind and your thinking. Now you've now prejudged them in their intent. We can talk  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:32):**  about effect all day and that's what I do but I never assume that even people I disagree with  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:40):**  vehemently in politics for example. I always assume that they're good intended and I think  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:45):**  debate for this because in high school and college interscholastic and intercollegiate debate  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:51):**  I have a room full of trophies on this you know I wasn't the shabbiest in the world loved it eight  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:08:57):**  in fact dad always said I majored in debate and minored in school so I never made the best grades  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:02):**  in the world but I just ate up debate and the way a debate tournament works is at least as you move  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:08):**  into the upper levels is that you have six preliminary rounds three of them you debate affirmative  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:16):**  three of them you debate negative and so it really does teach you to appreciate there is another side  
**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:24):**  and I think that when we go into these conflicts with a deep appreciation that there is another  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:32):**  side and a person who believes the other side is not necessarily evil intended it actually helps us  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:40):**  to go into that conversation at a better spot. Joel I think this is such an important conversation  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:48):**  our listeners here on this podcast are large-scale commercial growers from all over the world  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:54):**  including from here in the American Midwest and from California in the West Coast.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:09:58):**  All of us are on our own pathway we're all on our own journey of learning about the effects  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:04):**  that different compounds and causes have in agriculture and how we can improve our overall  
**[0:10:10-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:10):**  systems and every farmer has as you indicated all the farmers that I've ever had conversations with  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:10:19):**  have a desire to leave a legacy they have a desire to leave the soil better for the next generation

**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:27):**  it's easy for a commercial large-scale farmer to suddenly feel uncomfortable like oh here he goes

**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:41):**  right here it's important to point out we're not talking about scale and size per se we're talking  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:49):**  about a centralization let me give you an example right now look we've been in business a long time  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:32:56):**  we're not a huge farm although a lot of people you know when you hit i mean this year we'll probably  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:01):**  hit three million dollars in sales a lot of people say that's a pretty big farm and according to the  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:05):**  usda it is a big farm but why does it have such a small farm feel well because rather than  
**[0:33:13-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:13):**  centralizing we have expanded by duplication by decentralized duplication as opposed to  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:23):**  concentration for example if we raise a hundred thousand chickens they're not going to be in two  
**[0:33:29-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:29):**  great big poultry houses they're going to be in 300 little field shelters that we move every day  
**[0:33:38-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:38):**  with human labor not tractors and machines so it's very human centric and these are scattered on  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:48):**  our home farm we rent about 12 farms in the area and so they're scattered at other places and we  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:33:54):**  move them around from farm to farm we move our we move our personnel around from place to place  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:00):**  and so yes it's a lot of chickens sure it's a lot of chickens but it's not centralized in one spot  
**[0:34:06-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:06):**  we're very mindful of placing them where the soil needs the fertility where uh you know people can  
**[0:34:15-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:15):**  access it easily we're very cognizant of that whole um womb umbilical carrying capacity of the  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:25):**  of the ecological nest as to where we place these things there's no smell there's no flies uh it's  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:32):**  completely portable you know mobile infrastructure so say well uh we need to get these chickens uh  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:40):**  slaughter we need to get them butchered so what kind of processing facility you know thinking out  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:46):**  in the future well what if you know what what if we were doing a million chickens all right let's  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:50):**  just say it's really successful and we were doing a a million chickens well what would that look like  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:34:55):**  well then you start thinking about human scale and ecological carrying capacity and so for example  
**[0:35:02-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:02):**  you know dave shafer of uh featherman plucker fame has put together a cool poultry slaughter deal  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:10):**  where he gets these um used shipping containers he has some omeish minnow like folks down in  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:16):**  missouri that'll take these containers and refurbish them into small little uh mobile  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:24):**  processing facilities so you know for a hundred thousand bucks you can uh throw a chassis under  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:29):**  that bring it delivered to anywhere in the country set it on four pillars and boom you're in you're  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:35):**  in the processing business under federal inspection let's assume we want federal inspection  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:40):**  now can they do a million a year no they can't they can only do about 120 to 140 000 a year  
**[0:35:46-0:35:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:46):**  but guess what if we place those in farmland that can handle the real-time processing water  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:35:54):**  now we don't have to be in the hazardous sewage business we don't have to have slurry ponds and  
**[0:36:00-0:36:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:00):**  we take what the industry has as toxic waste and is a major cost factor to clean up we use that as  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:08):**  fertigation in real time because we're not overrunning and if every time we need another  
**[0:36:14-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:14):**  you know 140 150 000 bird capacity we don't increase the central structure we simply choose  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:23):**  another piece of land over here with this you know 30 acres that can handle all of the processing  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:29):**  water in real time as fertigation and we set another one over there and we set another one  
**[0:36:34-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:34):**  over here and we set another one over here and so we we scale by duplication rather than by  
**[0:36:41-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:36:41):**  centralization that is an incredibly democratized way to scale that's in direct opposition to the

**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:14):**  5 000 cal 10 000 cal operations but they're not going to be structured in a typical you know  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:37:22):**  centralized confined way and that decentralization creates resilience which is so badly needed in

**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:46:00):**  shift to a grazing grass-fed beef production model because it was my understanding at that time

**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:45):**  we're gonna instead put this in grass and grow calves now the the number that the farmers have  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:50):**  to that i supply that they don't know is that the equivalent amount if you're growing 100 bushel an  
**[0:47:57-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:47:57):**  acre dry land corn land that will grow 100 bushel an acre corn will produce 400 cow day grass on the

**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:17):**  cow per acre obviously land that only produces 50 bushel corn will only do 200 cow day you know  
**[0:48:24-0:48:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:24):**  per year and if land that will produce 200 bushel acre corn will do 800 cow days per acre so the  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:33):**  100 to 400 is pretty consistent well let's just go with 100 because that's nice and conservative  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:38):**  and uh no you know most farmers would would say 100 is a little bit low uh today most farmers  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:45):**  would want well you know more about this than i do but yeah they'd want in the 150 range probably  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:52):**  let's just assume 100 for example because it's easier to do the math in your head uh so 100 we're  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:48:57):**  gonna we're gonna score 400 equivalents so that's 600 stocker equivalents because the stockers are  
**[0:49:03-0:49:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:03):**  a little more than half of a cow so the 600 stocker equivalents so we're gonna we're gonna  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:09):**  get these calves at you know 500 pounds what are they gonna you know they're gonna grow uh you know  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:15):**  and of course again the ruble farmers you know they sit here and they they throw out these  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:19):**  numbers and and that's let's be very conservative and say this calf only gains a pound and a quarter  
**[0:49:24-0:49:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:24):**  a day and we're going to keep it for 200 days 200 days and a pound and a quarter is 300 pounds and  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:33):**  we're going to buy that calf for you know x amount they give me a number we're going to sell it for

**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:49:56):**  expenses in we're going to have mineral hauling labor you know moving them around you know there's  
**[0:50:01-0:50:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:01):**  really no equipment there's no fertilizer there's no planting there's no harvesting that's all

**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:17):**  mortality there's going to be some death loss the point is that um at a dollar fifty per cow day  
**[0:50:25-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:25):**  even if we chop that substantially to a dollar per day times 600 stocker days is six hundred

**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:50:55):**  sometimes more but for sake of discussion right now let's just say it comes out to three hundred

**[0:51:43-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:43):**  would triple because that's what it would take to get people to plant it it would have to match the  
**[0:51:51-0:51:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:51:51):**  the reward of growing beef yeah and guess what guess what as soon as corn tripled guess what

**[0:52:27-0:52:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:27):**  as to what you know beef and pork and chicken were and corn were worth if you take those ratios  
**[0:52:36-0:52:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:36):**  for example in his day the cow value was 10 times the turkey today it's 50 times so in his day a  
**[0:52:49-0:52:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=0:52:49):**  turkey was worth 10 times a cow if you went and bought a turkey it was worth 10 times what a cow

**[1:07:27-1:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:27):**  farming that we do here at polyface because it is it's not capital intensive and it's highly mobile  
**[1:07:34-1:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:07:34):**  and so when you have mobile infrastructure and you have high management so your equity is in skill

**[1:08:01-1:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:01):**  worth of buildings and equipment to generate that hundred thousand dollars our farm here our ratio  
**[1:08:09-1:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:09):**  is 50 cents to a dollar so if we're generating a hundred thousand dollars in sales we only have  
**[1:08:14-1:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:08:14):**  50,000 in buildings and equipment that's a big difference in actual capital costs versus cash

**[1:11:42-1:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:42):**  fedex and ups and something on a regional level they're not going global but they're just regional  
**[1:11:48-1:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:48):**  but because they're nimble and they're small and they're low capitalized they can actually undercut  
**[1:11:53-1:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:11:53):**  on a local regional business they can actually do even better so these are these are trend lines  
**[1:12:00-1:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:00):**  that we see this is such an exciting conversation joel and i'm really really happy to be having this  
**[1:12:07-1:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:07):**  conversation because there is the challenge of succession but succession is about more than just  
**[1:12:13-1:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:13):**  the transfer of equity it's also a transfer of skills and like you i get many emails from people  
**[1:12:21-1:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:21):**  at both ends of the spectrum older farmers who want to have young people take over their operation  
**[1:12:27-1:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:27):**  but also many young people even particularly many from a non-farming background have a desire to get  
**[1:12:32-1:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:32):**  into farming and you and i both know that the skill level required to be a successful farmer  
**[1:12:39-1:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:39):**  you can't just transfer from an un-farming background and expect to be successful and so  
**[1:12:43-1:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:43):**  there's the model that you're describing gives those people who truly have the grit and  
**[1:12:49-1:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:49):**  determination and the wherewithal to be successful an easy entry without a colossal failure potential  
**[1:12:59-1:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:12:59):**  yes well look if you want to raise chickens in the commercial model the first thing you have to do  
**[1:13:07-1:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:07):**  is build a half a million dollar chicken facility but if you want to raise chickens with us or in  
**[1:13:14-1:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:14):**  our model all you need is about 300 bucks to build a pastured shelter and you start okay if  
**[1:13:21-1:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:21):**  you're good at it and you enjoy it then you can build a second one and you can build a third one  
**[1:13:26-1:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:26):**  and so you know we now have the equivalent more than a car gill or you know tyson chicken house  
**[1:13:34-1:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:34):**  but they're they're all these little uh little portable shelters that we can place at different  
**[1:13:41-1:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:41):**  different fields different farms different plates different times different people can operate them  
**[1:13:46-1:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:46):**  and they're completely separate from the land base the single biggest cost of farming is land  
**[1:13:52-1:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:52):**  but if you don't have to capitalize the land and you can jump in i mean this this is why this is  
**[1:13:58-1:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:13:58):**  why a little uh one and a half acre intensive you know spin spin farming the sustainable produce  
**[1:14:04-1:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:04):**  intensive whatever what the end is but anyway you generate you know 150 000 on an acre of very very  
**[1:14:12-1:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:12):**  intensively run uh a place i mean the uh singing frogs farm in petaluma california they're one of  
**[1:14:19-1:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:19):**  my you know heroes a couple came in they were not farmers they bought five acres and this land was  
**[1:14:25-1:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:25):**  50 000 an acre it was at petaluma california but they actually cash floated through their produce  
**[1:14:31-1:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:31):**  operation now they can grow 12 months of the year but they use techniques for example where they can  
**[1:14:37-1:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:37):**  they use starter trays so they take all that early seedling phase run that in starter trays  
**[1:14:43-1:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:43):**  so the only thing that actually goes in the ground is an actual plant from juvenile to maturity  
**[1:14:49-1:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:49):**  and that way they can actually on some of their stuff they can actually get 12 crops in a year  
**[1:14:54-1:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:14:54):**  per square foot well suddenly you know you're you're into the 200 000 an acre income and that  
**[1:15:03-1:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:03):**  works but it's extremely skill knowledge and management intensive the single most important  
**[1:15:10-1:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:10):**  piece of equity that any farmer has is experience and you can't google experience so when somebody

**[1:15:24-1:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:24):**  organic non-organic commercial not commercial the fact is over half of what we do on the farm  
**[1:15:30-1:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:30):**  building a fence fixing a trailer hitch how to back a trailer basic stuff that's not organic or  
**[1:15:37-1:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/resilient-agriculture-models-for-the-future-with-joel-salatin/#t=1:15:37):**  inorganic it's just regular life experience that's the most important equity you can have going into

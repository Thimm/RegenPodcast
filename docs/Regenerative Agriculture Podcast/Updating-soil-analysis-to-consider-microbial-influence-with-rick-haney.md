**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we talk about the  
**[0:00:05-0:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:11):**  health, and ultimately public health.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:14):**  My guest for this episode is Rick Haney, a name that you've probably heard or hopefully  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:19):**  you have heard and are familiar with over the last couple of years who developed the  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  soil test that carries his name and a soil test that I'm quite intrigued by.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:29):**  We started using it on our farms that we do consulting work on and I wanted to have this  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:35):**  conversation to learn more about how the assay came to be and what we can learn from it and  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  to hear from Rick's perspective directly.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  So Rick, thank you very much for joining us and for sharing your wisdom.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  Oh, glad to be here.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  Rick, you've become very well known for the soil test that carries your name now in the  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  last couple of years, but what was the pathway that led you to developing that soil test  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  and what brought you to this point?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  I get that question from time to time.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  I grew up in Iowa as a kid and my grandfather farmed, well both my grandfathers farmed,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  so I was around agriculture a lot, but until we moved to Oklahoma when I was like 15 or  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  16, I ended up starting working on farms.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  I had worked on farms in Iowa, but I was young and I couldn't do much, but I went to work  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:26):**  for farmers and ranchers in Oklahoma and I watched them for years borrow a million dollars  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  to fund their operations and I watched just the devastating effect of the way we do agriculture  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  on their ability to make any money.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  I always felt bad for them because it was like, how can we help these guys?  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:47):**  How can we help these guys do better?  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  Because I'm watching them spend all this money, hardly make any money, and supposed to be  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  feeding the world and all that, and yet why is it such a struggle?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  So that really impacted me as a young man.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  Then the opportunity later in life occurred to go back to college.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:09):**  I had actually dropped out of college after a year and a half of high school and just  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  went to work on farms and ranches, did furniture upholstery, and I did a whole bunch of things.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  Came back to going back to college to get my degree and then it was like, what am I  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:28):**  going to do with my life?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  I had an uncle in Austin, Texas that said, yes, why don't you get into agriculture?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:35):**  That's what you're passionate about.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  So I got into Texas A&M, which is a whole other story, but ended up getting my master's  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:43):**  and PhD.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  My focus was to give these farmers and ranchers some hope, give them some tools to help them  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  have the opportunity to make a living at what they were doing.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  What happened after you left the university?  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  There's still a big distance there between leaving university and developing a soil assay.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:05):**  So what led you eventually to realize the need to have better tools to manage or to  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  measure soil nutrients?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  Well, when I was in graduate school, I did a lot of experiments and testing on different  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:16):**  things, and I remember so clearly a colleague of mine, Dr. Alan Franzlubbers, showed me  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  an equation that he had worked on.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  He was doing these soil incubations.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:27):**  So we're trying to look at the life in the soil, the microorganisms, breathing CO2, and  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  we were doing these long-term soil incubations like four, five, six weeks, six months, and  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  it was like, wow, look at that.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  These soils are separating by this amount of CO2 that they respire.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  Their fertility was lengthened.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:48):**  So the more they respired, the more fertile those soils were because we knew these soils.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:51):**  He showed me this, and he said, you know what, I think we could do this test in one day.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  I said, well, let's try it.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  So I started doing it, and sure enough, we figured out you could do this 24-hour CO2  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  release from a dried, re-weighed soil and get the same type of information you get from  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  a 30-day incubation.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  That's when the light bulb went off, and I thought, well, here we go.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  We can do something with this.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  We started down that road, and that's when I really discovered soil testing.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  You can do 20 years of research and come up with something, a new crop variety or something,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  and that's all great, but how can we impact these guys every year?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  How can we help them every year?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  In over-fertilization, everybody knows it's happening.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  It seemed to be a key component that we could zero in on to really make an impact.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:45):**  I think over-fertilization is one of the most significant and one of the least appreciated  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:52):**  factors in agronomy and plant nutrition.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  When we started using plant SAP analysis, which I consider to be pretty much the epitome  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  of nutrition management at this point, some of the best technology we have available,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  it quickly became clear that agronomy is using the wrong frame of reference when thinking  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:15):**  about nutrition management.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  Our entire frame of thinking has been framed around the law of the minimum.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  We need to run an assay, figure out what's missing, and add more.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  We've completely missed the opposite, which is the law of the maximum, which is the nutrient  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  which is in excess that creates deficiencies of something else, and over and over and over  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:36):**  again when we use SAP analysis, we see that in fact, the deficiencies that are showing  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:41):**  up in plants are a result of the excesses of nitrogen and potash, particularly sometimes  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  also phosphorus that growers apply.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  It's actually the excesses that people are applying that are creating deficiencies.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  It is these nutrient excesses that are at the foundation of most disease and insect  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  challenges and most crop yield and quality challenges that many growers experience, and  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  it's largely unrecognized in mainstream agronomy today.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  Oh, I agree with that.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:12):**  We've got a pretty big dataset of soil health parameters and standard analysis and all that  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:20):**  stuff, and when we see really high nitrates in soil, the microbial soil respiration drops.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  I mean, it's a clear trend.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  My whole thing about this is I've been a real big fan of nature.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  I think nature's done research and development for quite a bit longer than we have, and has  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  the system figured out, and we came in and just really kind of ignored observation.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  My mantra is that nature is trying to tell us the correct way to do farming, the correct  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:50):**  way to interact with the earth, and we're ignoring that because of our so-called technology.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  The best technology in the world is right out there in the field.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  The best technology we have are our eyeballs and our brain.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  I want to listen to what nature's telling me.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:06):**  I want to stop and listen and observe and then try to apply fundamental rules that it  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  uses to the way we do agriculture.

**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:20):**  that's so eloquent and beautifully designed in front of us, and we're just going to go  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  on there and tear it up and do it through a weaver.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:28):**  Let's speak about the soil assay a little bit.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  From your perspective, it's evolved over the years, you've worked on this for a number  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  of years.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  What is the goal of the Haney soil analysis, and what does it do exceptionally well?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  What's the hole that it fills that other assays are not delivering on?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  Well, when I got into it, looking into all this in graduate school, the thing that struck  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:54):**  me was that, and I talk about this in my talks, is that there were farmers that had tech samples  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  in their fields out there, and these guys were growing 100 bushel corn with no fertilizer.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:05):**  At some of our research plots, we were growing 70, 80 bushel corn with no fertilizer in Texas,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:10):**  which is odd, because I'm going to say for the record, a good crop in Texas is crop failure  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  in the Midwest.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  I don't know why we're growing corn, but anyway, that struck me.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  Where's this nitrogen?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  And why are we not accounting for it?  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  So I started looking into that more and more.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  You look at all these long-term research plots that have got these tech samples that are  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  year after year with no fertilizer still producing crops, and it's like, wait, why are we not  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  accounting for this?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  How do we account for that?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  You're not going to go through the growing season and then go back in time and apply  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  the right amount based on the tech sample yield results.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  We've got to have something out in front.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:48):**  It seemed to me that the soil respiration being a representative of the fertility of  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  that soil was the key component to move forward in that, because carbon and nitrogen are coupled.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  We measure them and act like they're separate, but those are coming from the same molecule.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  So if you're getting this much respiration, you should be able to get this much nitrogen,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  especially if we know the CDN ratio.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:16):**  So that's really the biggest impact that this has, is estimating how much organic nitrogen  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  is going to be released from a given soil.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  As that number is roughly $20 an acre across the nation on average, not chump change.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  You look at the millions upon millions of acres that we're currently farming.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:38):**  What is the $20 per acre number?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  Is that the cost of over-applied nitrogen?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  So that's how much you can save if you use this test average.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  If you've been putting out, let's say 200 pounds of nitrogen to grow 200 bushel corn,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:54):**  and our test comes back and says, look, you can grow 200 bushel corn on 160.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:09:59):**  That's a $20 an acre saving in nitrogen.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:03):**  Only thing we seem to be able to control in ag is the amount of fertilizer.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:07):**  Your seed prices are set, your management's probably set, your commodity prices are coming  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  up, you're kind of set.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  The one thing that farmers can really have a control over is how much fertilizer they  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  put out on their land.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  I can certainly relate to the scenario that you describe.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:22):**  We also have growers that we've worked with throughout the Midwest, but at the moment  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  there's one example that comes to mind, a very distinct example in southwest Kansas,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  that was growing corn on corn, dry land, and for the three-year period that I have in mind,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  they were averaging in the neighborhood of 17 to 18 inches in rainfall per year, so it  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  was higher than their typical rainfall in that region.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:48):**  They were averaging 180 to 200 bushel corn per year, three consecutive years, with no  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  cover crop, no manure, no liquid fish or anything else.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:10:59):**  This was an organic operation.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  There was no nitrogen input other than a microbial inoculant that was known as zodobacter and  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:08):**  others that were known to have the capacity to fix nitrogen.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  They were growing 180 to 200 bushel per acre corn crops with no additional outside-in inputs  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  year after year.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:21):**  I can relate very much to the scenario that you're describing that there are these ecosystems  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  that are supplying all the nitrogen that a crop requires without outside inputs.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  The question of how we account for that and how we measure that is a critical one.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  The next question that comes to mind for me on this assay, William Albrecht used to have  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:44):**  this saying about the state of soil science at the time.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  He would say that you should read books and study nature, and when the two of them don't  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  agree, you throw out the books.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:02):**  In my opinion, I believe this also applies to soil reports, and I have my own perspective  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  on the mainstream soil reports of looking at Caddon exchange capacity and minerals that  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:15):**  are supposedly exchangeable.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  I think that can provide us some useful information, but what I can say with complete confidence  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  is that there is zero correlation between the minerals that show up on those types of  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  soil reports and actual plant absorption.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  We have a database of hundreds of thousands of samples that shows that to be very clearly  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  the case.

**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  How often do we need to throw out that report?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  That's a good one right there.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:17):**  So I'll answer that with a long-winded answer.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  This will be fun.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:22):**  At our research farm at the USDA, we've got about 158, and we split that up into conditional

**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  We were tracking that every three months, pulling samples every three months.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:34):**  It really got to be interesting because we were seeing these changes.

**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  It's like, oh my God.

**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  There are some analysis that I've seen that are useless.

**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  What does respiration look like compared to the amount of carbon?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  Those kind of things.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:37):**  The first thing I look for is everything looked kosher and everything looked like it was balanced.

**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  It should reflect, you should be able to get a yield response based on the fertilizer we're  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:52):**  using.

**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  It's just like when somebody sends us one sample to represent a thousand acres and they  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  don't understand why everything didn't work exactly right.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  You make a very important point.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:05):**  It's a point that we've observed.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  It's much the same as when we've started using SAP analysis very intensely and our history  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  before the HEMI analysis, actually before SAP analysis, we used to use soil saturated  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  paste analysis on our high value fruit and vegetable crops.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  We would measure on these high value crops where it's important to understand what's  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  happening and what's going on.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  We would conduct a soil assay in the row every 14 days through the growing season.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  Now we do that with a SAP analysis.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  I think this is the historical use of soil analysis has allowed us to develop the paradigm  
**[0:17:45-0:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  that it is okay to take one sample per season and have that reflect the entire year.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  When in reality that you couldn't possibly imagine a way to misrepresent living systems  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  more.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  They are a dynamic system.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:02):**  So with SAP analysis, we take samples constantly through the growing season and it's an incredibly  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:08):**  valuable exercise because you learn how nutrients are being released from the soil profile very  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:16):**  clearly and you learn what the plant is actually absorbing.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:19):**  So the scenario that you described of only pulling one sample per thousand acres, I would  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  say you're making an equal or bigger mistake to only pull one sample per year and expect  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  to understand what's going on in your entire soil profile because as you described, and  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  I'll actually pose this as a question, what happens when you get an inch and a half of  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  rainfall three days before the sample is collected versus not having had any rain for three weeks  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  before the sample is collected?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  How does that influence the results?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:47):**  Well it does influence results.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  The interesting part about this test is that when we put samples in the lab, we dry every  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  one of them, we dried them pretty gently and we do that on purpose.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:18:58):**  We don't want to destroy the aggregate that's sitting there, which you certainly do if you  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:02):**  overgrind it.

**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:09):**  the same playing field moisture-wise because what we want to do, especially with the respiration  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:15):**  test, we dry that sample and then we re-wet it.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  That's an important thing because we stop the system by taking the water out of it by  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  drying it and then we rev it back up and let it tell us what it sees.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  Because ballgame out in the field is not static.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:35):**  It dries, soils dry out, they get re-wetted, there's a flush of nitrogen and phosphate.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:39):**  This is why plants green up after it rains because of the nitrogen that's available from  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  the organic fraction.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  So we're trying to mimic that in the lab.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  The whole test is based on let's stop this system and then rev it up and see what's happening.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  Now in theory, if the soil is dry when you take the sample, we should see the flush and  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  we should be able to estimate the nutrients.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:08):**  If you took it when it was dry before it rained, we're hoping that we're mimicking what's going

**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  Because one of the things we've also seen is when we get samples in and we've gotten  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:19):**  an unbelievable amount of different types of samples, some that are more water than  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:25):**  soil, those don't work very well.

**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  The point is we're trying to estimate what happens when it rains.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  That's where the ballgame is.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  Soils dry out, they get re-wetted, they dry out, they get re-wetted, and that's where  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:54):**  the soil comes from.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  That's how everything rains out.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  So in essence, what you're describing is that if the amount of rainfall that you get during  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:04):**  close proximity to the sample is going to influence the lab results.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  Yes, but it really shouldn't matter whether you took it before it rained or after it rained  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  because we're trying to mimic what's going to happen when it rains.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  So we get this question a lot, when should I sample?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  My answer is when do you want to know something?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  What do you want to know?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  If you're interested in reducing fertilizer inputs, then take a sample a couple weeks  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  before you put on fertilizer.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  But if you're interested in what's the dynamics of my management system and soil health and  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  all that, then take two or three or four samples a year at different times and watch that trend  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  and see what's happening.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  The other thing we recommend is composite a bunch of samples in your field and then  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  go to your fenthrow and take a composite set of samples out of that because you're not  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:21:53):**  farming the fenthrow.

**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  it is.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  It's really been fascinating to see those results from around the country, the folks  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:06):**  that are doing that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  In my opinion, Rick, I actually believe that there is a lot of value in sampling even more  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  frequently than what you are describing.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  So I would propose that not necessarily, you don't need to do this across the entire farm,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:23):**  but select a representative field that has been exposed to a certain crop rotation or  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:29):**  whatever is standard or maybe a couple of fields and measure them every 30 days during  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  the growing season.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  I have experienced this on many different farms and in many different fields.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:43):**  When you take multiple samples in a season, you get to see the trends of how biology becomes  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  active.

**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:56):**  You get to see crop nutrient demand.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  All of a sudden, this picture of nutrient interactions and biological delivery becomes  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  really, really clear.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  It is so inexpensive for the information that you get.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  This is, from my perspective, this is way more valuable knowledge and way more valuable  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:16):**  information than collecting a couple of samples per season over a lot of acres because you  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  get to see how your crops and soils truly interact in ways that you don't see if you  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  just collect a couple snapshots in time.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  You get to see the true trend lines.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:32):**  I agree with that 100%.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  You hit on something there.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  I've had so many farmers say, why are these commercial ads charging $50 or whatever they  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  charge for this test?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:43):**  They say, I can get a standard test for $8 or $10.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  I said, well, that's great if you didn't want to know anything.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:49):**  To me, that's money wasted because it's not telling you anything about how the system  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  actually works.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  You're going at it blind.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  I'm a big fan of more data that tells you that's what we started doing every month.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  That was so eye opening to me.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  It just absolutely shocked me.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  The one thing that really struck, and I'll give you a quick scenario here.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  We had had wheat planted in our field.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  We're in high pH soils, 8-2, a bunch of calcium.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  You can still see the seashells in there.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  It's 55% clay, so high pH, high clay.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:25):**  So hardly ever get any phosphate when we extract it with pounds 8 pounds.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  Not enough to grow a crop.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  However, it seems like we grow crops every year.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  Oddly, it gets that.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  One year when we were doing that monthly sampling, we had wheat growing out there.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:45):**  It was rocking along there.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  We were seeing 8-10 pounds of phosphate.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  Then when the head started to move up into the boot phase and really started to develop,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  we had pulled samples and all of a sudden there was 30 pounds of phosphate.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:01):**  Never seen that before ever.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  That was a direct indication that those plant roots were dumping those organic acids out  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:08):**  and volubilizing that phosphate and there it was.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  Then the next month it was gone.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:14):**  The head didn't already cut it.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  It was just so eye opening to see validation of the theory that you think, we know they  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  release organic acids through the roots, but here it was.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  We had fertilized these soils in 20 years and boy that was neat to watch.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  There is only one thing that is worse than no data and that is bad data.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:43):**  Bad data or data that is based on a false premise gives you the expectation that something  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  is okay when it's really not.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:25:57):**  I have perhaps a different opinion than the mainstream.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  I'm sure I do.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  I would say that the mainstream Melek 3 extraction or ammonium acetate extraction is usually

**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:11):**  well what does the soil's mineral geological foundation look like?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  How much sand, silt, and clay is in it?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  What is the biological activity?  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  We take all these other factors into consideration to try to interpret the results and sometimes  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:26):**  we're correct, sometimes we're not.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  So I think the value that I see in the analysis that you have developed is removing some of  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:37):**  the external factors and the rules that we need to consider and the exceptions to the  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:42):**  rules that we need to consider when making recommendations.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  Well yeah, when I was developing the extract back in the early 2000s what struck me was  
**[0:27:50-0:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  that we had like baleic 3, brae 1, mone mastate which is fairly neutral and we had olecine.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:27:59):**  So we had these highly acidic acids and these highly alkaline extractants.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:04):**  It's like where's the middle?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  What's happening in the middle here?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:08):**  I wanted to develop an extractant based on what plant roots do and the fun part is it's  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:13):**  not highly buffered, the extractant.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  So the pH of the soil tends to determine at what pH it gets extracted at and that just  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  made sense to me.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  It's like if you over buffer and extract it then you're ripping out phosphate, potassium,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:29):**  and calcium that's not really present for a plant to deal with or if you're doing it  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:35):**  too alkaline again you get the same result.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  I was also shocked at how easy it was to move all those numbers around based on just a little  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  bit of tweaking to an extractant.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:48):**  It made no sense to me.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  So I really spent a lot of time developing that.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  Earlier in our conversation we were speaking about the variability of data and when do  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  we throw out the lab report and you commented that sometimes you see numbers coming back  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  from laboratory assays that don't make sense.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  So I know that as a government employee you have some sensitivity about making laboratory  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  recommendations and I respect that.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:18):**  I would like to ask the question, it's my understanding that the assay has evolved over  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  time.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  You've developed different generations of it, you're constantly refining it and tweaking  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  it and improving it.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  Who are the laboratories that are running the most recent version?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  Well to my knowledge there's this lab, Regen Ag Lab has contacted me and they've got the  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  most recent iteration.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:41):**  Brookside Labs got the most recent iteration.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  There's one called I think Next Level Ag in South Dakota that does.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:49):**  I don't tell these people this is what you should be doing because I'm a federal employee,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  that's all up to them.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  But if they contact me and want to inquire about where are we at, what are we doing,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:01):**  I'm more than happy to give them all the information.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  That's just not a problem.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  But there's quite a few labs that don't seem to have any contact with us at all.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  It's odd to me because I've seen a lot of results that don't reflect what we originally  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:16):**  designed.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  It gets to be challenging at times when we get results back and the numbers don't make  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  any sense.

**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  You should call these labs and tell them and I'm like no, you call for your money, your  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  deal.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:33):**  If they want to call me and ask me maybe we're doing something wrong, then I'm more than  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  happy to help them try to figure that out.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:42):**  That's out of my hands.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  The assay that as you've developed it is relatively new.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  I suppose you could say it's actually not that new given the amount of time that you've  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  been working on it.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  How much calibration is still needed for this assay to become mainstream and to become accepted  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  by the mainstream?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up because that's such a fun calibration.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  I have looked and I spent a great deal of time in graduate school looking at the so-called,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  and I'm going to say so, calibration from the standard test.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:16):**  When you dig and you look, there is no calibration.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  They have so much variability in their data, it's mind-blowing.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  I'm not bad-mouthing them, I'm just saying this is a daunting task because again, we're  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  trying to use static systems like when you put this recipe of NP and K down, you should  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  expect this yield.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  That's fun.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:42):**  That is not how it works.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  There should be tremendous variability.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  They should not be calibrated very well.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  Boy, they defend so fiercely that their data is calibrated.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:54):**  I remember, I won't say who, but I got into a conversation with a scientist that was talking  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  about their university calibrations were on the money and I found the paper.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  It was written in 1953, there was six points on it for phosphate.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  Phosphate added yield, six points.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:12):**  R squared, which is just a number, was like 0.25.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  I thought, that is terrible, but they were still using it to that day.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:22):**  To this day, they're still using that.

**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  Well, here's the reason.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  Nobody wants to spend the time and the money to really get at this stuff.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  My point of view was, we've got this new set of tests.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:39):**  I know that we can back off on nitrogen and phosphate because we have the evidence that  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  you can grow all this yield for various crops with no fertilizer.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  We know that.

**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  fraction we're measuring in the water extract, that's good to go.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  We're good to go.

**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:02):**  It doesn't have to be quote-unquote calibrated.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:06):**  The biggest joy I have is when farmers call me and say, I grow 160 quicks of corn a year  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  and a year out and I did it with half the fertilizer in the last three years that I

**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  Calibrations, come on.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  It's going to rain.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:29):**  You might have a drought.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:31):**  We can't tell.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  Because I remember one guy one year said, well, I'll tell you what, if it don't rain,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  your fertilizer recommendations aren't going to work.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  I said, well, neither is the fertilizer.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:42):**  He just looked at me like, okay, got it point taken and walked off.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  We don't think like that.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  We just don't think about how nature does things and how is this test I developed perfect?  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  No.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:33:58):**  It's the beginning of the change.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  We've been doing these standard soil test methods since the 40s and 50s.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  This is the 21st century.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:06):**  Surely to God, we can do better.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:10):**  Again, nature is telling us, look at the dead zone of the Gulf.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  There's your calibrated data right there.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:17):**  I told this in an audience a while back.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  I said, so apparently our standard test is calibrated to the dead zone of the Gulf.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  Everybody's kind of looked at me like, what?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  Think about that.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:28):**  We supposedly had this calibrated data from all this stuff in 60 years, and the dead zone  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:34):**  of the Gulf gets bigger and bigger.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:36):**  We're apparently calibrated to that.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  That's not really what we're after.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  It's a very good point, Rick.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  The reality is that any time you have a new innovation, new technology, whether it's a  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  new product or new soil assay or whatever it might be, there will always be detractors  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  and there will always be the defenders of the status quo.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:34:56):**  The one question that comes to mind when I was thinking about this conversation is what  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  would the detractors have to say about the presently existing soil assays if they were  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:10):**  being developed today as new technology?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  I think you made a great point earlier.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:14):**  Is that the quote-unquote calibrations, they're not based on agronomic reality and actual  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  crop required nutrients and soil required applications.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  We have lots of evidence for that.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:26):**  Yeah, I've had several conversations, fairly heated at times, from folks and different  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  universities and I'm like, well, we can end this argument.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:37):**  Just send me your calibrated data and I'd just like to see it for my own benefit.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:42):**  Well, they can't ever seem to find it.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  It sure never gets to you.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  I mean, that's the end of the conversation.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  Then I followed up a couple of times and they were like, well, we don't know where it's  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:53):**  at.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  I've had several conversations and I've also actively gone out to look for it in the literature  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:35:58):**  and in the data.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  If it exists, it sure is hiding very well.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  Yeah, and I'm not down on any of that.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  It's just that, come on now, if we're going to judge a new test by old standards that  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  didn't work and defend them, defend the old standards that don't work and try to make  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:17):**  the new one fit into, that just doesn't make any sense to me.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  We in ag research should be, we don't have to rely on growing a crop because all of us  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  researchers would be broke living on the street.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:30):**  It's real easy for us to say this and that, but I want to help these guys, these farmers  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:36):**  and ranchers.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:38):**  We get paid to do ag research.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  We should be doing everything we can to come up with solutions to help farmers be more  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:43):**  efficient.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:44):**  That's on us and we've done a terrible job of education.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  Our methods have not been well thought through and it's the 21st century for God's sake.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  I talk about in my talks, is anybody carrying around a rotary phone in their pocket?  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  But we're still carrying around soil testing methods from the 40s and 50s thinking we know  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:04):**  something.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  We don't know hardly anything about how soil actually functions.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:09):**  Rick, I very strongly agree with the perspective you just expressed and the same is true of  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  plant analysis.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:19):**  I've been a big advocate and champion of plant SAP analysis for the last decade, which all  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:24):**  the listeners of this podcast surely know.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:28):**  And the reality is that dry matter based tissue analysis is also 60 to 70 year old technology.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:33):**  And it's incredible to me how many conversations I've had with agronomists.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:39):**  It seems about every agronomist who has roughly a decade of experience, who pulls a lot of  
**[0:37:44-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  tissue analysis and pays close attention to them somewhere between five and 10 years in,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  depending on the crops and the context they're working with.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:53):**  They say, you know what, this tissue analysis does not correlate to anything that we're  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  doing.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  It's worthless.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:00):**  And yet many of us continue to have continued to use them because it is the technology that  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  we're familiar with and that is most widely used and known.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:12):**  Well sure, and you know as well as I do that change is hard.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  It's hard for all of us.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  And when we come along and say, you've been doing this soil testing wrong for 60 years,  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  that's a tough bill to swallow.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  I'll get that.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  Because somebody's going to come along and say, well Haney tried his best but that was  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  like a really pretty dumb set of tests he came up with in the future.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:33):**  That's going to be young.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:34):**  I'm going to be like, well now wait a minute.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  I don't want to be that guy.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  I want to embrace and I hope before I die that somebody improves upon all this.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  It has a better view that I didn't see because I can't see at all.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:49):**  I do know that what we've been doing isn't working because we have the evidence, again  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:55):**  the dead zone in the Gulf.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:56):**  So we had to make a step in the right direction.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  And what you're talking about with SAP analysis versus tissue is a step in the right direction.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  This set of tests versus the standard test is a step in the right direction.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  We've got so much to learn.

**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:17):**  A few episodes ago, I had the privilege of having a discussion with Rick Mulvaney from  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:23):**  the University of Illinois where he described how they are now measuring amino sugars in

**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  How does that soil nitrogen report compare to your soil nitrogen report and how should

**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:45):**  For the record, I like what Dr. Mulvaney has done.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:47):**  I think he's been out in front.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  I really admire the things that he's done.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  He took on the standard issue thing.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  I'm a big fan of the organic fraction of nitrogen.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:01):**  His test was, I thought, a breakthrough thing.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  I did a bunch of his tests with a bunch of soils many years ago and compared them with  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:08):**  soil respiration.

**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:14):**  The thing that I thought was going to be very difficult was that I know a lot of farmers.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  They're used to putting on X amount of nitrogen every year and they were not ready for us  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:25):**  to come in there and say, you don't need any nitrogen.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  Based on this Mulvaney test, you don't need any nitrogen.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:33):**  They're not going to do that.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  My deal was I wanted to be a little more specific.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:40):**  That test, it uses sodium hydroxide.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  It basically rips the nitrogen out of the soil and then traps it.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:47):**  Then you can back titrate to find out the answer of how much nitrogen is in there.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:51):**  That's fine, but not all of that's in play.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  What I was looking for with my test was what's in play right now.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:00):**  That's really the difference.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  It's going to show there's a lot more nitrogen there than we are and that's fine because  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  he's got different ways to interpret what you're seeing than other people do.

**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:17):**  Until the farmers are ready to really accept that we can buy with quite a bit less than

**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  Our chances, we're never going to recommend as little nitrogen as what the Mulvaney test  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  might.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:33):**  I guess that's really the difference.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  He's looking at a big extract of nitrogen and we're looking at a smaller pool based  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  on a water extract.

**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  I don't have any experience with Rick Mulvaney's assay.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  I'm looking forward to doing some experimentation in the coming growing season.

**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  and we generally make recommendations to our growers to apply as little nitrogen as possible  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  at planting.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  We'll look at history and context and what's going on.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  We prefer to apply none.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  We will wait to make our recommendations for side dress nitrogen or nitrogen applications  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  later in the season if that capability exists.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  And then we make recommendations for nitrogen requirements based on actual measured crop  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  requirement.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  And it's common for us to, in a single year, reduce nitrogen applications by 40 to 60 percent.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  That's very common.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  And to have yields go up at the same time as we're doing that.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:44):**  And the reason we are comfortable making those recommendations and the reason the growers  
**[0:46:48-0:46:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  are comfortable applying those recommendations is because they can actually see it in the  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:54):**  field.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  You get a sap analysis report back that shows that a crop has a desired value of, let's  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  just say, 1,500 parts per million nitrogen in the plant sap, and the actual level is  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:04):**  3,000.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  Then you're not going to gain or benefit anymore by adding any additional nitrogen.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  So it's a real, really strong in-season, in-field validation of what's actually going on.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  And I imagine you could do something similar to that with your soil analysis by measuring  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  every 30 days in the season and seeing what's actually going on.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  And I also think that in the future we're going to see a big impact from in-field sensors  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:31):**  that can be put in the field and measured periodically.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:36):**  I think the future of a whole lot of this analysis is going to be in-field testing.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:41):**  Again, if we can't figure out what's happening in the field, we're kind of wasting our time.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:47):**  And I think the sap stuff is awesome.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:50):**  That's a great point because I'll tell you, I've been working on some of these in-field  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:54):**  sensors and I had a farmer that I've known, I used to work for him, and he's been farming  
**[0:47:59-0:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:47:59):**  for 40 or 50 years, conventional tillage, monoculture weed, won't change, won't listen.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:08):**  And I took some of these sensors up there to his farm a while back and showed him the  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  microbial response in his till field versus 20 feet away in a pasture.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  And I will never forget the look on his face because, I mean, I've known this guy a long  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  time, and he was stunned.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:23):**  And I said, you see how those numbers fell off really badly when he went from your pasture  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  to your till field?  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  He said, yeah, that's the effect of tillage.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:29):**  I could have slapped him in the face and done less damage.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  I mean, he was just stunned.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:35):**  And I thought, there it is right there.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:37):**  They need to see in their field in real time, from time to time, what this looks like, what  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  is actually happening.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  Because it wasn't me telling him anything.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  He was watching the graph.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:49):**  He was watching the movement.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  And there it was.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  And boy, that is so important.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  You hit on something there that's so important because it's the psychology of these farmers  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:02):**  that has got to be also helped, like all of us.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:05):**  They've got to have a different perspective.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:07):**  They've got to see these things differently.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:09):**  We've done a terrible job of educating farmers on how soil actually works and how plants  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  actually work and what's really going on.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:16):**  And we just got to do a better job.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:17):**  Rick, I'd like to change the conversation for just a moment to get your insights and  
**[0:49:23-0:49:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  perspectives perhaps on a more macro level of where the world of agriculture is going  
**[0:49:29-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:29):**  and where the opportunity exists in the future.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  What is something that you believe to be true about ag that is different from the mainstream  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:36):**  view?  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  That would kind of go towards the whole nutrient density of foods.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:41):**  I believe that the way we're doing modern agriculture is producing a fairly poor nutrient  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  dense food.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:47):**  And we can do better.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:49):**  Everybody knows that their garden grown tomatoes are better than soil.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:53):**  Again, nature is telling us this is the wrong way to grow things.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  We've got to do this differently.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  I don't know what it's going to take to change the mindset that the agronomic system that  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:07):**  we've got right now is not sustainable, especially for children and grandchildren.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:12):**  We are at a place right now where I think we can turn the corner and start moving and  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:17):**  just admit that maybe we haven't done it perfectly and there's room for improvement here.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:23):**  I'm not sure I even answered your question.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  Well I think in a general sense your assessment is that what is different from the mainstream  
**[0:50:35-0:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  viewpoint is that you're indicting mainstream commodity food as not being nutritious, if  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:42):**  I'm understanding it correctly.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  Yeah, I believe that.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  We have a garden and my wife Liz does a fantastic job of growing gardens.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  I've never had such cantaloupe and watermelon.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:54):**  It's just like my God, it's night and day compared to what we're buying.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:50:59):**  And again, being a big fan of nature, there's never been a drop of fertilizer put in her  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:03):**  garden.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  The only fertility that's been put in her garden is cover crops.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  And my goodness, what a change, what a difference.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  Especially when it rains, we've never seen such quality of food coming out of that plot  
**[0:51:15-0:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:15):**  of gardening.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:17):**  We didn't use cover crops before.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:18):**  We've never used fertilizer.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  We've had gardens for many years and when we introduced cover crops into that garden,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:26):**  my God, everything changed.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  This is something that nobody really believes yet mainstream-wise.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  Cover crops are the key.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:36):**  I've said many times that I'd rather see somebody conventionally till with cover crops using  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:41):**  cover crops than no-till without them.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  And I believe that, that it's the key.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  Yeah, I agree with you on that.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:48):**  I know that's a very controversial opinion.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  There are many ecosystems and many crop production systems where no-till, a dogmatic no-till  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:56):**  is not the answer.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  It is not.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  But that's a conversation for another day.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:00):**  I'll give you a quick example.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  We had a guy, a researcher, send us two samples that were composite samples, one for a convention  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  till, one for no-till.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:10):**  We ran the analysis, sent it back to him, he said, your test is wrong.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  That was his first thought, your test is wrong.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  I said, why?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:17):**  He said the conventional till is higher in nutrients, soil health score, everything than  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:21):**  the no-till.

**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  He said, about two weeks before I sent the sample.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:30):**  So again, he was just convinced that no-till was better.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  So you've got this dogma on both sides, conventional till or no-till.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  The point is you've got to be versatile.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  I know farmers in Oklahoma that are set up to go conditional till or no-till depending

**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  It is.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:05):**  Yeah, we've had the same.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  We've uncovered a number of different, I won't call them science pieces because when you  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:13):**  dig into them, you discover that they're actually not supported by evidence.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:17):**  But there's been a lot of narratives in mainstream agronomy about certain nutrient interactions  
**[0:54:23-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  or how nutrients behave and interact with each other, which when you develop a large

**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:33):**  it's not just unsupported, it's disproven.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  And there's lots of fun things to unwrap there.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  Rick, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[0:54:43-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  That's the easy one, that your soil is alive and that you should treat it like that.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:50):**  And I think that soil respiration is an excellent educational tool to show them because, you  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  know, I have farmers and people that come through the lab, you know, we've got these  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  CO2 sensors and I let them breathe into it, you know, immediate spike of CO2.

**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  some inanimate object, like a machine, you're going to treat that very differently than

**[0:59:22-0:59:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  What we want is these farmers to understand that the economic health of their operation,  
**[0:59:32-0:59:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:32):**  free will choice, this is the better way and not go down the road being forced to, I think

**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:49):**  made many times is that it really can be simple economics.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=0:59:56):**  You earlier mentioned the number of reducing your, on average across the entire country,  
**[1:00:02-1:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  reducing nitrogen applications by $20 an acre.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:06):**  I know with complete confidence that the growers we actually do consulting work for across  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  the Midwest and well, across all of North America for that matter, we are reducing fertilizer  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:17):**  application costs, nitrogen applications by a whole lot more than $20 an acre.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  I believe that.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:23):**  In many cases as well, as I said earlier, 40 to 60%, we're often exchanging those costs  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:29):**  with other things to improve overall soil health and improve overall plant health and  
**[1:00:33-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:33):**  improve yields and so forth.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  But you can look at this very directly and very clearly as a direct cost savings.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:41):**  And when you look at saving $20 or $40 an acre on nitrogen applications, how much does  
**[1:00:50-1:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:50):**  a $50 assay actually cost?  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:53):**  It doesn't cost money.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  It's making you money.  
**[1:00:57-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:57):**  And SAP analysis makes you money.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  Soil analysis, good soil analysis makes you money.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:02):**  It's just, we should actually not be looking at these things as an expense.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:08):**  They're not really an expense.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  They are a management tool, completely different perspective.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  I agree with that.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:13):**  I had a farmer, I was up in Omaha, Nebraska, giving a talk and this guy stood up the front  
**[1:01:17-1:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:17):**  row and he said, I'm not giving no $50 for a soil test.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:21):**  He was ready.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:23):**  It was awesome the way he did it.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:24):**  I said, well, okay.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:25):**  I said, that's fine.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:27):**  I said, what if that $50 soil test, I said, how many acres are you farming?  
**[1:01:31-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:31):**  He said, 100.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  I said, what if that $50 soil test saved you $20 an acre?  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:36):**  I said, so you're not willing to spend $50 to save $2,000?  
**[1:01:41-1:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  And he got real quiet and put his head down and he looked back up at me and he said, well,

**[1:01:52-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:52):**  It's like we get locked into that, well, a soil test ought to cost $10.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  Well, how about a better soil test?  
**[1:01:58-1:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  You think that would cost more?  
**[1:01:59-1:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/S3EP18_RICK_HANEY_AUDIO_FINAL.mp3#t=1:01:59):**  Does a better car cost more?

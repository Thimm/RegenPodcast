**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:24):**  really capable of producing. And one of the developments along this line that I have been  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:30):**  very intrigued by and I'm excited to share with you is the system of root intensification  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:37):**  that Dr. Uchoff has developed. So Norman, welcome to the podcast. I'm very glad to have you here.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:44):**  And I don't want to describe too much of your background in my own words because it is very  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:50):**  rich and I'd love for you to just tell us a little bit about your pathway and the work that you've  
**[0:00:56-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:56):**  engaged in over the last decades developing this different model of growing plants. Okay, well I  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:03):**  grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin just south of Madison so I am a farm boy originally but I  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:10):**  had the good fortune to go to Inters Minnesota and then to Princeton Berkeley to prepare myself for  
**[0:01:16-0:01:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:16):**  the social sciences of development in Africa, Asia and Latin America. And for my first 30 years of  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:24):**  professional work I was focused on things like audio associations, farmers organizations, women's  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:31):**  groups, local government decentralization and so forth. But then in 1990 I was appointed the  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:38):**  first director of our Cornell International Institute for Food Agriculture and Development  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:42):**  which was set up in 1990. I was a very generous at that time anonymous gift to work on problems  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:49):**  of sustainable agriculture and rural development. The third year into my 15 years of tenure I  
**[0:01:57-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:57):**  was asked to go to Madagascar by the USAID mission out there and so I was a colleague of mine from  
**[0:02:05-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:05):**  from Cornell who was francophone and who spoke French that is and also knew more about rice than I did.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:13):**  Dairy farming is very different from rice farming and so John and I went out there to look at the  
**[0:02:19-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:19):**  project USAID had funded to help conserve the rainforest area which was under challenges and  
**[0:02:27-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:27):**  was dwindling because of slash and burn agriculture. And the first morning I was out in the field with  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:35):**  John in just some of the poorest villages I've ever lived in. I've been in quite a few countries.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:43):**  I remember attorney John saying yeah we've really got to get the rice yields up here.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:48):**  They're only two tons per hectare. The world average is about four so it's half the world average  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:54):**  and as long as they produce so little rice on the available irrigated area they have  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:00):**  they're going to have to go into the forest and cut down trees and do slash and burn agriculture.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:07):**  And he agreed and when I got back to Tom and Marie the capital the Malagasy project coordinator who  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:14):**  I talked to who had a background in agriculture as well as conservation said you know you're right  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:20):**  you're right I agree with you. Would you like to talk to a small NGO that does something called  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:26):**  system of rice intensification? We're telling Benjamin I don't know much about rice I know  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:33):**  even less about Madagascar. If they know both I sure should talk to them and see what I can learn.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:39):**  So he arranged them to come over to our office that afternoon and I started explaining what I  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:46):**  thought the problem was and Benjamin translating to Malagasy and I still remember the NGO presence  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:54):**  of leaning forward as I talked and when I finished he wages and said part of problem no problem.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:02):**  And he said we have a system of rice intensification which uses the same seeds as before  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:09):**  uses compost instead of chemical fertilizer and uses maybe half as much water as with usual  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:16):**  irrigated rice production and we get yields of five ten even fifteen tons per hectare.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:23):**  And I imagine my eyebrows went toward the ceiling. You can't do that the green revolution  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:30):**  uses new seeds uses more agrochemicals and also use more irrigation water. Here they're doing  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:38):**  here they're doing none of those and they're getting five or ten or fifteen tons per headwear  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:44):**  average in the country is about two. And I remember thinking to myself actually I think I  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:49):**  said it to them I said let's not talk about ten or fifteen tons because nobody at Cornell's are going  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:54):**  to believe that. I didn't say I don't believe it. No one at Cornell. Cornell will believe it and  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:00):**  you know they didn't mind my thing. We aimed for maybe three or four tons per hectare.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:08):**  We worked on an agreement we had USAID funding for this so their NGO would provide four field  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:16):**  staff to train farmers in these new methods that have been developed by a French Jesuit priest  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:22):**  who had been living in Madagascar for over 30 years at that time. And turned out by the end of

**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:41):**  that North Carolina State University had studied for a PhD thesis. These are some of the worst

**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:56):**  because it means they're very acid. And the available phosphorus is less than half the  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:01):**  minimum of 10 parts per million that most agronomists thought was necessary for even the

**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:13):**  Three to four parts per million. This should sound already crazy so you know it looked very  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:19):**  good in our report. Next year we had 68 farmers and they averaged over eight tons again and  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:26):**  third year we still had farmers over eight tons average some as high as 10, 12 and 14. One was 16.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:34):**  Using the same methods for measuring yield as the government using its yield trials and reports.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:41):**  So at that point I figured I had to start learning French so I could read the priest's  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:46):**  papers and also agronomy so I could try to explain to my colleagues at Cornell what.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:51):**  So I want to correct your earlier statement John. I did not develop this. This is something  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:56):**  I never would have dreamed of developing because I'm a social scientist not an agronomist. But  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:02):**  father Henri de La Launier had spent 30 plus years working with farmers in Madagascar

**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:23):**  these set of methods that are if I say most of them counterintuitive which greatly increased the yield  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:30):**  and to put in very critical terms but they're not uncommon terms anymore  
**[0:07:36-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:36):**  from a given genotype or variety given genetic potential we got plants which were much more

**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:00):**  were exposed to various kinds of influences and we developed into the phenotype that we are.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:07):**  Well the plants that grew at SRI were you know usually two to three times more killers.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:14):**  Root growth is two to three to four times greater. They stayed green longer and didn't start dying

**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:27):**  As I say they gave higher yields. They were more resistant to pests and diseases.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:33):**  They didn't go over in the storms very easily. They could withstand water stress and even drought

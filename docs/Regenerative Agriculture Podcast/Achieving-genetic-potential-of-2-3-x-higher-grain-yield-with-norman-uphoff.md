**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast.  Thank you for being with us and for listening. Today I have Dr. Norman Uchoff from Cornell  University. One of the themes that I've spoken about a bit in the past is the idea that we're  harvesting only a fraction of the inherent potential that our seeds and our plants are  really capable of producing. And one of the developments along this line that I have been  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:00:30):**  very intrigued by and I'm excited to share with you is the system of root intensification  that Dr. Uchoff has developed. So Norman, welcome to the podcast. I'm very glad to have you here.  And I don't want to describe too much of your background in my own words because it is very  rich and I'd love for you to just tell us a little bit about your pathway and the work that you've  engaged in over the last decades developing this different model of growing plants. Okay, well I  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:03):**  grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin just south of Madison so I am a farm boy originally but I  had the good fortune to go to Inters Minnesota and then to Princeton Berkeley to prepare myself for  the social sciences of development in Africa, Asia and Latin America. And for my first 30 years of  professional work I was focused on things like audio associations, farmers organizations, women's  groups, local government decentralization and so forth. But then in 1990 I was appointed the  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:01:38):**  first director of our Cornell International Institute for Food Agriculture and Development  which was set up in 1990. I was a very generous at that time anonymous gift to work on problems  of sustainable agriculture and rural development. The third year into my 15 years of tenure I  was asked to go to Madagascar by the USAID mission out there and so I was a colleague of mine from  from Cornell who was francophone and who spoke French that is and also knew more about rice than I did.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:13):**  Dairy farming is very different from rice farming and so John and I went out there to look at the  project USAID had funded to help conserve the rainforest area which was under challenges and  was dwindling because of slash and burn agriculture. And the first morning I was out in the field with  John in just some of the poorest villages I've ever lived in. I've been in quite a few countries.  I remember attorney John saying yeah we've really got to get the rice yields up here.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:02:48):**  They're only two tons per hectare. The world average is about four so it's half the world average  and as long as they produce so little rice on the available irrigated area they have  they're going to have to go into the forest and cut down trees and do slash and burn agriculture.  And he agreed and when I got back to Tom and Marie the capital the Malagasy project coordinator who  I talked to who had a background in agriculture as well as conservation said you know you're right  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:20):**  you're right I agree with you. Would you like to talk to a small NGO that does something called  system of rice intensification? We're telling Benjamin I don't know much about rice I know  even less about Madagascar. If they know both I sure should talk to them and see what I can learn.  So he arranged them to come over to our office that afternoon and I started explaining what I  thought the problem was and Benjamin translating to Malagasy and I still remember the NGO presence  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:03:54):**  of leaning forward as I talked and when I finished he wages and said part of problem no problem.  And he said we have a system of rice intensification which uses the same seeds as before  uses compost instead of chemical fertilizer and uses maybe half as much water as with usual  irrigated rice production and we get yields of five ten even fifteen tons per hectare.  And I imagine my eyebrows went toward the ceiling. You can't do that the green revolution  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:04:30):**  uses new seeds uses more agrochemicals and also use more irrigation water. Here they're doing  here they're doing none of those and they're getting five or ten or fifteen tons per headwear  average in the country is about two. And I remember thinking to myself actually I think I  said it to them I said let's not talk about ten or fifteen tons because nobody at Cornell's are going  to believe that. I didn't say I don't believe it. No one at Cornell. Cornell will believe it and  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:00):**  you know they didn't mind my thing. We aimed for maybe three or four tons per hectare.  We worked on an agreement we had USAID funding for this so their NGO would provide four field  staff to train farmers in these new methods that have been developed by a French Jesuit priest  who had been living in Madagascar for over 30 years at that time. And turned out by the end of  the first season they could only get 38 farmers to try these new methods because they're quite  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:05:35):**  counterintuitive but their average yield was eight tons instead of two. And these are soils  that North Carolina State University had studied for a PhD thesis. These are some of the worst  soils they ever analyzed. Very low cation exchange capacity on all horizons. pH is 3.8 to 5  because it means they're very acid. And the available phosphorus is less than half the  minimum of 10 parts per million that most agronomists thought was necessary for even the  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:07):**  poor you know lowest acceptable yield. And they were less than half of that minimum.  Three to four parts per million. This should sound already crazy so you know it looked very  good in our report. Next year we had 68 farmers and they averaged over eight tons again and  third year we still had farmers over eight tons average some as high as 10, 12 and 14. One was 16.  Using the same methods for measuring yield as the government using its yield trials and reports.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:06:41):**  So at that point I figured I had to start learning French so I could read the priest's  papers and also agronomy so I could try to explain to my colleagues at Cornell what.  So I want to correct your earlier statement John. I did not develop this. This is something  I never would have dreamed of developing because I'm a social scientist not an agronomist. But  father Henri de La Launier had spent 30 plus years working with farmers in Madagascar  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:08):**  trying to figure out how to enable them on very small plots with very poor soils. They had  adequate rainfall if it came at the right time but they really were desperately poor and he developed  these set of methods that are if I say most of them counterintuitive which greatly increased the yield  and to put in very critical terms but they're not uncommon terms anymore  from a given genotype or variety given genetic potential we got plants which were much more  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:07:47):**  desirable more productive more of phenotypes phenomena. These are the actual organisms you  and I are both phenotypes. We started from genotype but over the course of our life we  were exposed to various kinds of influences and we developed into the phenotype that we are.  Well the plants that grew at SRI were you know usually two to three times more killers.  Root growth is two to three to four times greater. They stayed green longer and didn't start dying  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:20):**  back and senescing midway through the season. They were more upright so they intercepted more sun.  As I say they gave higher yields. They were more resistant to pests and diseases.  They didn't go over in the storms very easily. They could withstand water stress and even drought  conditions. So really quite phenomenal and I was a political scientist by training so for me this  is all a matter of learning what's going on and trying to get scientists who knew more about  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:08:53):**  agronomy and soils than I did to take a look at this. Unfortunately the International Rice  Assertions Institute which we went to and asked them to work with us to evaluate this never  picked us up. They were pretty well satisfied that making genetic improvements would suffice  to meet the needs of small farmers and big ones of course as well. As it turned out that you know  these methods lower farmers costs, less inputs, more robust in the face of the environmental  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:09:31):**  and climate change pressures. We've even discovered since we're trying to article on this  based on three published scientific articles showing that when you use these alternative  methods you get more copper, zinc, manganese, iron in the grains of rice. So the plant  takes more of these micronutrients and concentrates more of them in the grains  themselves. So it's really quite a remarkable thing and maybe the other remarkable thing is that  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:10:04):**  these same ideas and methods if suitably adapted for other crops give similar kinds of yield  increases and similar hardiness to resist climate change stresses. So it's been really quite a  quite a 20-year adventure. Took me three years to accept this as I said I guess in 97 I tried to  cite it was for real and took us another five years to get up to try and get these methods on  15 countries. Now we can say we have reports with you know good evidence that you'll get a better  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:10:37):**  phenotype from rice at least with these methods that were over 60 countries where we were able  to show that there are these benefits. We can talk a little bit more about this since most of your  listeners I guess are from the US. We've gotten a few things started in the US but for the most part  American farmers and they know they're in trouble because of farm costs and climate stress and so  forth. But the idea that something which is developed for really small really poor farms in  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:11:09):**  Madagascar helping them with their 500,000 or more acres hasn't really gotten through yet.  And of course we have to also talk about how these ideas or these principles can be applied with the  mechanization that thanks to a colleague a large and very smart and progressive farmer in Pakistan  we can now you know describe directions these ideas can be taken for large-scale production.  I better stop I go on like this. That's a little background for you. Thank you for sharing that  
**[0:11:44-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:11:44):**  background and for the correction on the source and how this develops. It seems to me the yields  improvement and all the quality improvement, the climate resilience, the data, the numbers that you  quoted an average of 4x yield increase or higher those would be really powerful motivator and a  really powerful incentive to reconsider our farming practices and think about what we might be able to  improve. So certainly I think the listeners of this podcast are growers who are very innovative  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:12:20):**  and who desire to do a better job. So I'm very hopeful that we can gain some traction here.  I think so we've you've given us the description and background of SRI and you've alluded to the  methods. I guess the obvious question is what are these methods? What is the system of root  intensification? How does it really work? Well this is assembled very empirically, very inductively,  experimentally. Father Lani came to Madagascar in 1961 with no prior experience with rice. He'd  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:12:58):**  grown up in a large wheat farm in southern France, gone to the best ag school in France before World  War II but decided as the war was getting started he really wanted to you know serve humanity rather  than create himself to go back to the farm of his family. So he went to Jesuit Seminary from 1941 to  45 and then he got sent to Madagascar in 61. Initially he tried to introduce other crops which  have higher nutrient content than rice which is mostly good for his calories but it turned out  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:13:35):**  that Madagascar farmers just weren't interested in the vegetables, the broccoli, carrots, etc.  They needed to get their rice yields up because Malagasy's generally eat three meals of rice a day,  maybe two vegetables or once in a while some meat with them. And so what he found his side was I got  to tackle the problem at his base, work on rice, and he found a few farmers who were planting just  single rice seedlings in a hill rather than three, four, five, six seedlings in a club which is what  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:14:09):**  farmers do almost every country in the world because if you put a single seedling it looks  pretty puny and pretty meager. So farmers put half a dozen in and they figure maybe the insects or  something gets a few of them there should be something there, kind of an insurance policy.  But it turns out if you plant plants close together the roots inhibit each other. We know  you don't plant tomato plants in a clump, you don't plant any plants in a clump, but for some  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:14:44):**  reason we thought that rice will do better in a clump and it certainly makes the transplanted  field look better because it's got more green in it and so does mud. But in fact rice plants if  put in the soil all close together they don't grow the same kind of good systems  deep and broad and long-lived. He found some other farmers who were growing their rice without filling  the fields continuously which is sort of the ideal. Most farmers think for irrigated rice you  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:15:19):**  want a couple inches on the surface and if a little is good more is better so they like to  have four, five, six inches of water standing on the field. It looks beautiful because it reflects  the sky and a nice blue color and silver not just muddy brown. But in fact when you flood the fields  you suffocate the roots. You cut them off from their air supply and so they start degrading after  a couple weeks and so they get really truncated root systems especially as they're growing in  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:15:52):**  close proximity. And so just simply taking, they cut the plant population way down and cut your  waterway down. Those two changes already gave better rice crops. Father Larni invented the next  practice. Farmers were planting their rice plants helter skelter which is the common way.  Ag scientists have been trying to get them to plant in rows so they could use a mechanical weeder  that you'd push up and down the rows to uproot the weeds and burrow them in the soil. It's kind  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:16:32):**  of green manure. And Father Larni thought what happens if I plant in a square pattern and then  I use this weeder in perpendicular directions at 90 degrees. He just tried it and no farmer is  right in my way ever think of this because if you're doing single seedlings and you know wide  spacing you're cutting your plant population by 80 to 90 percent and that was a stupid way,  super thing to do. We all think more is better so you plant more seeds, but you get more seedlings  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:17:08):**  the higher yield you should get. It's not true but it sort of seems that way. And so anyway he  developed this method of weeding with this soil aerating weeder because it turns up the soil and  gets more oxygen in the top layers. That's very good for the roots to grow better but it's also  good for the soil organisms to grow better. The bacteria and fungi which are beneficial,  the nematodes and protozoa which cycle nitrogen. Eventually you get the earthworms which will  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:17:40):**  make the soil sort of macro aerated because you get pore space. What you're doing in SRI is really  managing the plants and the soil and the water and the nutrients in different ways to get synergy  among the practices which we have good evidence on, but also so that you're really growing larger,  deeper, longer live root systems and you're increasing the abundance of life in the soil  as well as the activity and diversity. The capstone in a practice was when almost by accident  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:18:16):**  Prabhu Lani discovered in 1983-84 that if you start with very young seedlings only 10, 11, 12  days old instead of two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks which farmers like to do because  they're bigger healthier seedlings when you transplant them the field looks not quite so bare naked  as it does when you put single you know seedlings in by themselves. He found out that if you  transplant 15-day seedlings or younger you get more growth of roots, more growth of tillers,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:18:50):**  even better grain weight. That I could go into if you want to ask me. It's a story which is sort of  separate but it gives a scientific basis for why using very young seedlings is preferable. Many  people are horticulturalists who will know that again with you you're going to plant the vegetable  seedlings you don't want to get them very mature before you set them into the soil because there's  less vigor. When I go to the farmers market I have to tell myself not to buy that biggest and  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:19:21):**  most handsome tomato set but rather take a pretty young one and take a little longer for it to  mature but I'll get much much better yield from it. So anyway he synthesized these practices  and that was what he called SRI and then when the government took the subsidy off chemical  fertilizers in the late 80s he switched to compost because the farmers he worked with could not afford  to buy fertilizer at a higher price and it turned out if you do these other five things then with  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:19:52):**  compost you get even higher yield than with chemical fertilizer and so that was kind of the  last step. And again we have very good evidence on this even published in the Erie Proceedings back  in 2002 but ignored. So these different practices say the effect is to get more tiller growth or  root growth the root growth being really critical but then also by increasing the soil organisms  from the microbes to the the macrophonic earthworms and mites and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:20:27):**  columbola and so forth. And it turns out the same things of wider spacing, lower plant population,  providing enough water for the plant and its needs and also the soil iota and their needs  but not too much not enough to create hypoxic conditions in the soil so the soil is mostly  aerobic most of the time getting more organic matter into the soil to feed both the soil  organisms and the plant. These practices together give you a very different phenotype and I wish we  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:21:00):**  had you know visual capacities for the podcast to just see the difference in the plant growth.  I've been given a a panicle of rice in Sri Lanka which is just huge as a single head of grain  and if you get a hundred grain on head of rice that's that's okay 200 is pretty good.  300 you're really excited, 400 you're ecstatic, this is 930 grains. Wow. One head of rice.  And you know I counted them. And in Indonesia a couple years ago my wife and I were  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:21:41):**  brought a big wooden box we were oh no we don't want to take any more gifts back to the states  were already fully packed and it was a stump of rice grown from one single seed that had 223  pillars or a stalk all from that one single seed. It's a huge clump and with huge you know mass of  roots on it as well. I couldn't bring it back to the states because of phytosanitary regulations  but I got a picture of it I fell out my hands and gave it to my Indonesian colleague to keep for us.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:22:16):**  The potential in the rice genome is really incredible we also see wonderful potential in  other plants like mustard plants that are as tall as I am over six feet and with you know two to  three times more yield when you start with a tiny young seedling and soil is broken up so the roots  can grow vigorously not in compacted soil given organic matter. So I'm going to give you a little  bit of a story about how you can use the soil to get a good  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:22:49):**  taste of the soil and to feed the plant as well.  Norman you've put out so many valuable thoughts. So I want to go back first of all to your comment on photos.  We can certainly share photos and to all of those listeners. I was listening as you were  describing the method of one of the elements of SRI. The list that I came up with from listening to you  were speaking about plant spacing doing a much broader spacing using less water and not flooding  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:23:19):**  and saturating the fields for extended periods and then the capacity to weed and aerate the soil  with mechanical cultivation using very young seedlings and then using compost applications  instead of chemical fertilizers. There's a few of those that I'd like to dive into a bit deeper.  We work with many in addition to broadacre crops we work with many vegetable growers and I've  observed the same thing they described that using young seedlings within a few weeks of transplanting  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:23:54):**  and growing them in optimal conditions and taking them straight to the field invariably we get much  better establishment less transplant shock and much more productive and high-yielding plants.  Can you describe some of what you've observed and how that occurs?  Well again the first thing is that Nisamie Fadlani discovered that you know Madagascar farmers were  treating the roots of the seedlings very badly almost brutalizing them. They let their seedlings  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:24:25):**  go to be six even seven weeks old in the nursery and then when they took them out from the nursery  the roots are so long they got in the waste they take the machetes and cut them off cut them back  and so they're putting these plants which had been amputated and the roots into standing water  three four five inches deep which suffocates them and that's what's called transplant shock  where it takes 10 to 14 days for the plants to resume their growth after they've been brought  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:24:56):**  from the nursery into the field. Also what he discovered was that if you take the seedling  you push it down into the mud the tip of the root will invert upwards so the root shape is a bit like  a J and what we say is that you want to put the roots in carefully so they're at least horizontal  you know they're nice so they're clearly vertical like an I but at least horizontal like an L  instead of a J so they can begin their or they can resume their growth practically immediately.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:25:28):**  We've seen this happen so treating the roots really carefully understanding how important they are  is a key element. Why do why does the roots grow so much better with young seedlings  with the shit that have been carefully handled? There's a bit of agronomic knowledge  developed in Japan that's not widely known which applies to all of the gromine or grass family  species that's why millet and maize and wheat and other plants have similar effects when these  
**[0:26:04-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:26:04):**  methods are used. Dr. Katayama in Japan in the 1920s and 30s studied wheat rice and barley  in laboratory and test plots and so forth trying to understand the tillering process and he came  up with the idea which is called phyllochron, phyllo for plant, cron for time and that's a  periodicity in the emergence of tillers and matching that in the emergence of roots growing  downward and sort of balancing the growth of the tillers upward and I don't know how many of the  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:26:41):**  listeners will know about Fibonacci series if they've read Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code  I don't know about that where each number in a successive period is equal to the sum of the  previous two periods so it's like one, one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen, etc. One and one is two,  one and two is three, two and three is five, five and three is eight, etc. It turns out that  in the first period of the rice plant's emergence it'll put up one main stalk tiller and the main  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:27:16):**  root going downward and then it has two periods in which there is no artillery or root growth  and then the fourth period it puts out a first primary and a root and then the next one another  primary and a root but then the one after that you get the third primary but a first secondary  from the first primary and you know roots are matching this and so you get this one, one, two,  three, five, eight, thirteen, twenty-one, etc. pattern if all the growing conditions are optimal  
**[0:27:49-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:27:49):**  and the seven principles for accelerating this periodicity include first of all temperature,  warmer temperatures, I say speed up the biological clock, colder temperatures slow down the biological  clock, if there's good sunshine insulation that speeds up the clock, shading slows it down,  if the soil is well spotted with nutrients the clock speeds up, if it's nutrient deficient the  clock slows down, if plants are close together they slow down the clock, the wide spacing,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:28:29):**  the root growth and the tilling all accelerates, if there's enough water but not too much it'll  be faster growth, if you're either too little or too much water slows it down. So anyway  sometimes the interest line if we can get material on this, there's this kind of periodicity in  rice and wheat and also in finger mill, we've been able to show that. So timing does make an effect  on the gene expression, spacing has an effect on gene expression, having enough water but not too  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:29:09):**  much that also helps to speed up the biological clock as I like to call it and you get a faster  growth. These are things that any farmer already knows at least intuitively but Katayama's work  which was done before World War II and then never published until after World War II and then  published only in Japanese and so far I've found two, three different sources in English about it  but there's been no translation in English which is a great loss. Farmers who grow wheat

In Australia the forage farmers or  cattlemen who raise forage know about fillecans but some of the rice, you know, sector  never quite picked up this as a discovery of Katayama and so now that my father had discovered  that younger plants are better and then he discovered the work for Katayama and I expect  he's a Eureka now I know why younger plants do better and when I got back to Cornell one of my

There's surely many facts including phyto hormone production under certain conditions  but again I'm not an ag scientist myself and so I can't give as good explanation probably as  someone else could. Norman I do want to talk a bit more about some other crops and commercial  applications also but one more thing that I think is important to unwrap a bit is the increased  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:30:56):**  effectiveness of compost versus commercial fertilizer. Why is compost more effective at  producing plant these types of yields? Why does it have this contributing effect that is a bigger  effect than commercial fertilizers? We've had a number of studies which show that for many crops  or many situations you may want to combine inorganic and organic to get some optimum  combination and so SRI is not against inorganic fertilizer but if you're doing all these other  
**[0:31:33-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:31:33):**  things and as the soil becomes more fertile over time which does with SRI phytoses it becomes  uneconomical to keep using inorganic fertilizer. We had two baccalaureate theses done on this back in  2000-2001 with very large operations. Students don't know how much work this kind of research  can be so they agreed it when they do it. The one student had 286 plus two and a half by two and a  half square meters random block design testing six variables at sea level and sandy soils on the west  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:32:15):**  coast of Madagascar very poor soils. The next year another one did his trials up at about a  thousand meters elevation up from the plateau good soils temperate climate instead of tropical  climate and we got the same pattern of response that and one of the treatments was either  recommended inorganic fertilizer applications or compost and it was interesting that the yield  results for all the different combinations we did factorial trials replicated the yield combinations  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:32:54):**  still were better with chemical fertilizer versus compost when you use one two or three of the SR  pack but if you use the whole package or set the SR packages the compost plots of yield of the  chemical fertilizer plots which we say is an indication of the synergy among the practices.  Using compost isn't just for the plants themselves but it's also for the soil organisms many of which  may not be that well known to your listeners live actually inside the plants as endophytes  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:33:33):**  symbiotic endophytes. In the last five to ten years we've become very conscious of how the  organisms inhabit our bodies around or within our bodies and really improve our health and vitality  we call human microbiome. Well plants also have plant microbiomes both fungi and and microbes  that enter through the roots somehow or through cracks in the roots and they live both in the  roots and then in the stems and up into the leaves. It's quite remarkable we now know that the  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:34:13):**  the microbes living inside the plant affect the plant's expression of its genetic potential and  I've worked with colleagues in China and Malaysia who've done the trials on this. I helped them  write it up but I couldn't begin to do the work myself. Well we've really got good documentation  that is microbes which affect the gene expression and to answer your first question how do we get  these different phenotypes is it's spacing, it's timing, it's enough suffocating the roots with  
**[0:34:44-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:34:44):**  water but it's also nurturing the plant microbiome which will make the plants perform better.  I can refer to three different pieces of research from China that helped me understand this.  A fellow named Feng Xi who's now in California he couldn't find a good egg microbiology position  in China but he was doing the studies of rice plants of the same variety. He was the same  variety for all his trials but he published this article in the Journal of Applied Microbiology  
**[0:35:28-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:35:28):**  Environmental and Applied Microbiology and he took six sets of pots, got soil that he homogenized and  sterilized and put the same soil in all six sets of pots. He kept one set of pots, you know just  the soil with no inoculation or no microbial amendments and then he took five different  strains of rhizobium and put the different strains in each of the five sets of pots  and planted the same aged seedlings and all the pots in together and then analyzed them and it  
**[0:36:07-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:36:07):**  turned out that the inoculated pots which had this rhizobium in them and which rhizobium actually  they showed with microscopic pictures enter the roots and then go up into the plant and inhabit  the various plant organs above ground. All five of the inoculated sets of plants had significantly  higher root growth, significantly greater biomass above ground, higher levels of chlorophyll in the  leaves, higher rates of photosynthesis in the leaves, a higher ratio of carbohydrates fixed  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:36:49):**  from CO2 in relation to the water transpires so the plant is more efficient at producing  photosynthate from a given amount of water and then significantly higher yields. And that was the  first thing and he said it to me and I think I said Eureka! Then five years later he published  another article as a postdoc in which he had taken the best of the five rhizobium and  Sinorhium melalate 1021 as a specific organism and he did what's called proteomic analysis  
**[0:37:30-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:37:30):**  where they're able to identify the the the synthesis of different proteins in the  roots or in the shoots or in the in the leaves and could identify 20 or 30  proteins that were significantly more abundant or less abundant where they either had a 50%  increase or a 50% decrease and this is evidence that the genes that synthesize those proteins  were either up to regulated or down regulated. That was published in the journal on Quaporteomics  
**[0:38:07-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:38:07):**  which was exciting and then his mentor in China at the Institute of Botany in the China Academy of  Agricultural Sciences and he and I got acquainted and he actually helped them write up some research  that they had been able to get published and this was even more elaborate more but in a sense they  were doing transcriptomic analysis where you're looking at the messenger RNA which you know comes  from the DNA and then triggers the plants dissection of particular proteins and this is  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:38:43):**  fascinating because they look at the plants in one set of plants they inoculate them with dead  bacteria and the other they inoculate the live bacteria which then inhabited the interior of  the plants and this article published in a very good journal I can't remember the name right now  showed that one day after inoculation of the second set of plants you had the upregulation  significant upregulation of about 100 different genes that they can thanks to very modern  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:39:19):**  technology they can actually identify which gene is upregulated and also even by how much  and then the third day there's over a thousand genes that have been upregulated by the fifth day  it's maybe a thousand by the eighth day it's maybe maybe 800. The thing was that they had  already shown in their experience that when they inoculated plants they had a growth spurt between  days three and eight and some things are going on that you could see at the plant level but at the  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:39:58):**  molecular biology level they could also see which genes are being up and down regulated things that  for instance would affect the strength of the cell wall that would affect the rate of cell division  cell elongation and so forth so it was showing that in fact microbes living inside the  plants are affecting how the plants express their genetic potential due back to your opening  observation. I found that rather interesting now I look at a plant that's doing well I say I wonder  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:40:32):**  what you know what the you know the microorganisms inside are doing to guide accelerate the genetic  activity. I recently interviewed Dr. James White from Rutgers University on the impact of endophytes  and rhizophagy and the aspect that you're describing that you're pointing out when we look at  Dr. Mabel Ho's work on the fluidity of genetics and horizontal gene transfer between  organisms and living plants then ultimately what you're describing really I mean when you think  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:41:11):**  about the rice plant that you describe where they typically have 100 seeds or 100 grains per head of  rice to 930 grains that's completely different genetic expression that plant I'm certain looks  visually very different from the plant that only has 100 seeds per head. Right. And the root systems  will also look very different and we have evidence that microbes exude phytohormones that will affect  the growth of roots and so inoculating plant roots with certain you know beneficial  
**[0:41:49-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:41:49):**  beneficial organisms will give you more roots longer roots more diameter of roots more surface area  etc. And the reason microbes do this if I can impute a reason to it is that the roots are  themselves exuding carbohydrates amino acids various organic acids into the rhizosphere  the soil area right around the root which then is food for the microbes the microbes  give the plants phosphorus to give them nitrogen and they mineralize various micronutrients  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:42:27):**  and in return for that I don't know where it starts with a chicken egg proposition but the  plants are feeding their microbes 20 to 30 percent of the photosynthate from the leaves let's say  of rice. Rice will be transferred down to the roots and will be put out into the rhizosphere  around the around the roots with the effect of nourishing sustaining the population of  organisms outside the plant some which come in and the fact that if any plants had evolved  
**[0:43:03-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:43:03):**  giving up 20-30 percent of the energy stores that they produce and got nothing back from it  they would not have survived these for 400 million years. The fact is that the  microbes provide services benefits protection etc. to the plant the plant provides food nutrition  energy to the microbes there's a symbiosis we usually just have the root surface now I know  there's actually going on inside the plants in endopedic ways so that the closest between plants  
**[0:43:42-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:43:42):**  and microbes the interdependence of plants and microbes is really quite marvelous and we've known  very little about it in the past farmers would say you know this this soil is really good what  they didn't see was the organisms in the cell that were making the soil more fertile and the plants  that grew in them more you know vigorous more rapid growing more hardy but that symbiosis between  plants and organisms microorganisms has been going on say pretty close to 500 million years  
**[0:44:20-0:44:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:44:20):**  we have fossil record back about 460 million years showing our busker mycorrhizae in the roots of  plants when they first started evolving on on land they came out of the ocean and you know  became terrestrial and so the symbiosis between plants and microorganisms goes back a long long  time as I said if the plants didn't get back as much or more than they gave up I don't think we  could have had a plant world and really ultimately a biotic world at all like what we have now  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/achieving-genetic-potential-of-2-3-x-higher-grain-yield-with-norman-uphoff/#t=0:44:55):**  it would not be a symbiotic and co-supportive relationship absolutely no you know when you  at the very beginning of our conversation you mentioned that this the development of this method  of SRI also resulted from the benefits was increased nutritional content which is a  topic the person you're very passionate about because of the implications for public health  and the message the necessity of producing more nutritious food for the growing world

**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative

**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to

**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status

**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture

**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:02:39):**  welcome to the show. We're very excited to have you here. Happy to be here, John. Ready to divulge  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:02:45):**  and talk, and thank you so much for the invitation, and I hope that this is productive for you and for  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:02:52):**  the listeners as well. Tom, you've done some fascinating research over the years, both of  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:02:56):**  your own and also some with your mentor, Philip Callahan. What are some of your most memorable  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:00):**  moments that led you to where you are today? Some of the most memorable moments for me were probably  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:06):**  getting fired at the University of Florida, which led me to study under Phil Callahan. So,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:12):**  that would probably rank near the top. Had that not happened, I certainly would not have been on  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:17):**  the path that I am right now. So, once that path began and I was looking at the time with  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:24):**  flea larvae, I was playing with them, a seemingly uninteresting insect or so I thought at the time  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:28):**  that led into my PhD project and allowed me to explore world of insect bioelectromagnetics,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:35):**  which then opened up a whole new world to me that I had never been exposed to, either in academia  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:41):**  or very little in the literature and even less in books. So, this has been an exciting journey for  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:48):**  me. The reason why is because it's a new field and the only ones I know who are even remotely  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:03:55):**  in the field are in the military. So, therefore, from academia, it's kind of quiet on this front,  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:01):**  but I do enjoy what I'm doing here and I'm happy that I had a chance to explore this fascinating  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:07):**  area of insect bioelectromagnetics. Insect bioelectromagnetics sounds fascinating. Can  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:13):**  you describe for us what that is? What are you actually working on? Not a clue. I couldn't tell  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:17):**  you anything. I'm just making up the word. The word has to do with the electromagnetic waves and  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:23):**  how they are influenced by organisms, thus the name bio. So, electromagnetic simply be involved  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:29):**  in the pure waves and bioelectromagnetics would be how these waves influence life. Now,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:34):**  these waves could be external to the organism, let's say environmental, or they could be internal  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:40):**  so that you would have communication going on within the organism as to what information needs  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:46):**  to pass from one organ to another or simply one part of the body to another, or in some cases,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:53):**  to actually amplify the message to make it more easily discernible to an insect or even any other  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:04:59):**  animal. So, the bioelectromagnetic field is relatively large because, I mean, they have a  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:05):**  journal out and there are many journal articles you can find, but the field specifically of  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:10):**  insect bioelectromagnetics is not. That is a much, much, much smaller field. So, for those  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:15):**  who are involved in the insect side of it, you can see that they are few and far between. But  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:21):**  the field itself is relatively small, which I guess gives me a certain amount of anonymity,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:26):**  which is required because I do run a research laboratory and we are not allowed to publish.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:32):**  And so, all of the research that we do, most of the research that we do is kind of kept under  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:37):**  wraps and we have had some absolutely wonderful discoveries that I really hope that someday I  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:42):**  will be able to divulge to the public. When you speak of insect bioelectromagnetics,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:48):**  what is the impact or the potential impact of your work on agriculture and what might farmers  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:53):**  be able to apply in the future? That's a difficult question because when you get involved in the pure  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:05:59):**  bioelectromagnetics, you're looking at these fields that really are not measurable and for  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:05):**  the most part should not be measurable because the farmer is not going to be out there with the type  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:11):**  of equipment in order to measure these fields. So, in a direct sense, there would be very little  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:16):**  impact. In the more general sense, there is a much larger impact that is simply not something that  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:23):**  most people are aware of and that is the energy and how it is acquired by plants. So, photosynthesis  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:29):**  is certainly a well-known phenomenon that everyone is familiar with. You find in textbook after  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:34):**  textbook, whether it be in biology or plant physiology. And so, that's kind of a starting  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:39):**  point in the field of bioelectromagnetics is the agriculture. If you can optimize photosynthesis,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:46):**  once you optimize photosynthesis, which has that electromagnetic component,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:50):**  biochemicals and organic chemistry and others as well, but once you optimize that, you then  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:56):**  optimize Brix level because the relationship between photosynthesis and Brix is about as linear  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:03):**  as you can get. I mean, the more a plant photosynthesizes, the higher the Brix reading is  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:08):**  and the higher the Brix reading is, the healthier the plant. And when you have a healthy plant,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:12):**  this is where you bring it into agriculture and it becomes very important to a farmer. Because  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:17):**  when you're raising healthy plants, you don't have to bring in, for example, all of the pesticides  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:23):**  that are being used today, whether it be herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, nematicides,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:29):**  it doesn't matter what side you're using, they're all doing the job of killing life and you're  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:34):**  trying to, as a farmer, what you're trying to do is you're trying to augment life and this  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:40):**  augmentation can take many different forms. So the sun and the energy that comes from it is  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:44):**  certainly an obvious one. There are less obvious electromagnetic waves out there. The human  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:49):**  frequencies are relatively well known and have been studied by atmospheric sciences for a long  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:07:55):**  time. Also, would have their influence too. And once you are surrounded by all these frequencies  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:00):**  and be able to absorb the energy or to use this as a communication piece, then you now have healthy  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:07):**  plants, healthy crops growing in a very healthy environment. And so understanding that and ways

**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:25):**  and how to optimize them and how to prevent the farmer from getting in the way or putting up any

**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:36):**  photosynthesis. I mean photosynthesis is so foundational that when you drive the increase,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:42):**  you're able to increase photosynthesis, then you have all these other benefits of increasing carbon

**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:52):**  focus a lot of attention on and usually approach from a biochemistry perspective of thinking about  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:59):**  how we can optimize photosynthesis. I have a couple of questions for you. One is how much do  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:03):**  you think it's possible to increase photosynthesis above what is common perhaps or normal depending  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:09):**  on how you chose to define that word? How much can it be increased? And looking at photosynthesis  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:14):**  from a bioelectromagnetics perspective, what tools would you use to optimize it and to increase it  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:20):**  if possible? Okay, well your first question and I'll probably forget your second question as I'm  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:24):**  describing the answer to the first, but how much can you increase it? You can increase it  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:28):**  substantially and the reason why I know that is because most of the crops that I've had a chance  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:33):**  to take a look at are between four and eight bricks. Now once you get up to roughly right  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:38):**  around 12, all serious insect damage stops and once you get up to about 14, you have a genuinely  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:46):**  healthy plant that is producing healthy food that you know can be consumed by a human being and will  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:52):**  lead to a long life, but because we are so far below what we consider to be let's say optimal,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:58):**  optimal would be 14 and above. 12 is kind of like the minimum so that you don't get the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:02):**  insect damage, but because we're right now between four and eight, I can tell you unequivocally that  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:08):**  we can increase photosynthesis considerably simply because we have many plants right now which are  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:15):**  suffering, suffering in the sense that they're not working up to their potential and so because  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:20):**  they're not working up to the potential, I know that we absolutely, I mean even getting to nine  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:25):**  which is still not a healthy plant is an improvement over a lot of the plants which I've  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:29):**  had a chance to look at whether it be plants out in someone's backyard or whether it be crop plants  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:35):**  out in a farmer's field, they're all dealing with very low bricks and therefore the plants are  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:39):**  compromised and so really the only way you can only go is up because the only, once you go down,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:45):**  plants die and there's really nothing which can save them at that point. So you do have a range  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:52):**  and then if you want to maintain a plant at a very low bricks, let's say one or two, you have to feed  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:57):**  it every day. There's no way around it. So anyone who has ever played the game of golf has walked  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:03):**  on plants that are running about one or two and if you go even one day without feeding that grass  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:10):**  under your feet, it will suffer considerably because they have very little photosynthetic part  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:15):**  above the ground. Their root system has been absolutely compromised due to usually what is  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:20):**  being applied and so that's the extreme case where you can actually, in a very artificial way,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:27):**  keep a plant going by continually feeding it. It's a force feeding operation and the same thing goes  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:33):**  with the crop plants. Now the crop plants, the farmer is not out there feeding them on a daily  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:39):**  basis such as you would find on the golf course. That would be obviously the exception but when  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:44):**  you're dealing with a crop situation, the farmer is going to be feeding his crops at the minimum.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:48):**  He's going to be doing it once or twice during the season but probably more often than that  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:53):**  depending upon what type of plant it is, whether it's a perennial or not. So it's a matter of  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:59):**  getting the photosynthetic rate up and this means certainly, as I kind of alluded to,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:04):**  is not putting up any of the blockages. Now some of the blockages that I'm kind of alluding to that  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:09):**  I discussed a little bit before are certainly and absolutely pesticide. The reason why this is so  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:15):**  is because pesticides are killing all of the microbes in the soil and the microbes can be  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:20):**  selectively killed. So one herbicide is going to selectively kill certain microbes, an insecticide  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:26):**  is going to kill a certain set of microbes as well, a fungicide will kill a certain set of  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:31):**  microbes and even a nematicide. We have nematicides down here in Florida. They're not as common in the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:35):**  rest of the country but each one of these is doing its job to kill. Now when these microbes are gone,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:41):**  they are no longer able to hold on to the energy that is in their body and so you have now given  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:47):**  up a massive energy source and this is where the electromagnetics comes in is that if you do not  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:12:52):**  have those microbes in there, there is no energy in the soil and so this sequestered energy, each

**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:13:08):**  massive amount of energy that if you stepped on some ground with millions of microbes it would

**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:17:57):**  are you willing to give up how much can you afford not to produce on sometimes they come

**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:56:08):**  they're they're cuddled they're they're given everything that they need and so therefore they're

**[0:57:18-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:18):**  that which is recent and i kind of alluded to it before simply because it's a focus of my research  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:24):**  now and that is after we decipher the insect olfactory code there are a massive number of  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:28):**  details to be worked out and so the thing which i've talked about a lot over the past few months  
**[0:57:34-0:57:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:34):**  to my laboratory mates and others too is how different insects are smelling the same molecule  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:40):**  that is something which is kind of forefront on my mind right now as i'm you know conducting this  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:45):**  interview so if i had to go back in my past it might take me a little longer to come up with  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:49):**  something and maybe be more intriguing than what i'm telling you right now but as of right now  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:54):**  that is on my mind and i'm amazed at how as a matter of fact while i'm giving this interview  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:57:58):**  i'm looking at frequencies right now for uh the indium meal moth on my desk and uh taking a look  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:04):**  at the uh the frequencies and understanding how they're smelling how they're picking up the  
**[0:58:08-0:58:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:08):**  pheromone and seeing the differences between the various odor receptors, gustatory receptors,  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:13):**  ionotropic receptors, things of that sort and putting this stuff together into a cohesive  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:18):**  smell is something that uh has kind of taken me off guard i was kind of of the impression  
**[0:58:24-0:58:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:24):**  certainly 20 years ago is that when you smelled an odorant that you know we had a receptor that's  
**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:30):**  that's kind of the way i looked at it you know we had a receptor and this receptor responded to  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:35):**  this particular smell now we know differently we know just for example and this is common knowledge  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:42):**  is that there are between two to three co2 receptors for insects they don't have one  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:47):**  receptor for carbon dioxide they have two to three receptors for carbon dioxide and i would  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:52):**  go so far as to say they have more but i won't go any further than what i just said and so when you  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:58:57):**  take a look at this and you see wow this is amazing i mean there's a complexity about it  
**[0:59:01-0:59:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:59:01):**  but there's also a simplicity uh too it is more complex because it wasn't what i thought but it's  
**[0:59:07-0:59:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:59:07):**  simplistic because i see when you put all this stuff together and i think wow this just kind

**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:59:22):**  i mean i had i had the big bad phd so i you know you kind of sort of think at that point that you  
**[0:59:27-0:59:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:59:27):**  you know quite a bit and now i can absolutely tell you how little i know i could not tell you  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:59:33):**  how little i knew 20 years ago but i can tell you exactly how little i know now and so these are

**[1:01:39-1:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:01:39):**  the things that i think are important i think a lot of people know about so if i told you you know

**[1:02:13-1:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:13):**  has become like my most popular talk you just get shocked from people i mean you have spoken heresy  
**[1:02:20-1:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:20):**  so even though i mean i i know where you stand on this john and and i understand many other people  
**[1:02:26-1:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:26):**  do agree with this philosophy and i get that but it still causes shock when i give this presentation  
**[1:02:32-1:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:32):**  it still does and it's one of the opening slides that i do and i said look if i'm gonna say a

**[1:02:41-1:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:41):**  i say i've talked a little bit about that right now but that's really the big shocker so if i  
**[1:02:46-1:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:46):**  had to limit myself to agriculture uh i would say that insects are only attracted to unhealthy plants  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:53):**  because if you believe that and i'm sure most of my listeners do not because i've seen the looks  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:02:58):**  uh on the crowds that i've spoken to if you do believe that your whole thinking changes on  
**[1:03:04-1:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:04):**  insects suddenly you have no use for insecticides i mean it just follows with that level of thinking  
**[1:03:10-1:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:10):**  because you realize well insects i'm not competing with them then they're just eating some of the  
**[1:03:15-1:03:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:15):**  garbage plants that i shouldn't be eating so i really don't need to spray them anymore so now  
**[1:03:21-1:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:21):**  are the organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids and carbamates and uh and neonicotinoids they're  
**[1:03:26-1:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:26):**  all kind of unnecessary and that's the the you know as you reason through this that's one of the  
**[1:03:32-1:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:32):**  conclusions that you come to you have to come to it when you believe that insects are only attracted  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:38):**  to unhealthy plants it's not just that statement that stands alone it's that statement and then you  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:43):**  have extensions coming off of that statement which help to explain things that people might not have  
**[1:03:49-1:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:49):**  considered before so i don't even have to come out as some sort of anti-pesticidal guy i can simply  
**[1:03:54-1:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:03:54):**  say insects are not attracted to unhealthy plants and by extension i would say yes insecticides are  
**[1:04:00-1:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:00):**  unnecessary they're just unnecessary as a whole under specific circumstances they have their role  
**[1:04:06-1:04:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:06):**  because i will be the first to admit to you you know i've had fire ants sometimes they'll come  
**[1:04:10-1:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:10):**  into the house i do have a raid can in my house and we have had situations where the kids you know  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:16):**  would leave food crumbs around and you know the situation has to be taken care of so i'm not afraid  
**[1:04:22-1:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:22):**  uh to use insecticides and i understand that they have their place however having said that uh when  
**[1:04:28-1:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:28):**  i'm raising crops uh and i and i do plant some stuff in my garden at my house i'm never ever  
**[1:04:34-1:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:34):**  spraying it with anything i'm not putting well i mean not pesticides i have no insecticides i don't  
**[1:04:38-1:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:38):**  have a knowledge of all the insecticides but i don't use any of them i'm not using any herbicides  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:42):**  or fungicides i'm just not going that route and that's just what comes that with that knowledge  
**[1:04:47-1:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:47):**  of that insects are only attracted to unhealthy plants that are not my enemy and i use them as  
**[1:04:51-1:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:51):**  indicators so i go out and i would check uh my my uh my corn plants for example and i would look to  
**[1:04:58-1:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:04:58):**  if it's being attacked and if it is what's what insect is attacking it and therefore come to  
**[1:05:02-1:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:02):**  a conclusion as to something maybe that i forgot on a particular so for example the first time i  
**[1:05:08-1:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:08):**  started planting corn i did have a few insects that were attacking it um by the time i got to  
**[1:05:13-1:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:13):**  the third time that i was planting corn no insects were attacking it but i had i suspect deer came in  
**[1:05:20-1:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:20):**  and cleaned me out and this is the difference between the insect digestive system and the  
**[1:05:25-1:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:25):**  mammalian digestive system is we have a higher level digestive system we can handle healthy food  
**[1:05:31-1:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:31):**  so the deer are more interested in healthy uh crop they're not going to go after unhealthy stuff  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:36):**  that'll they'll leave that up to the insects uh but if you do have a healthy crop you're going to  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:40):**  watch out for the deer because the deer came in and i think one night maybe two nights and i don't  
**[1:05:45-1:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:45):**  know how many of them came through they cleaned out about 140 i had about 140 corn plants that  
**[1:05:50-1:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:50):**  i had planted for the benefit of my family and i lost 99 of years on it uh overnight so these are  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:05:57):**  the things that i think i mean in a sense i'd like to pat myself on the back and think okay well at  
**[1:06:01-1:06:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:01):**  least the insects didn't get it i'm an entomologist that would have been embarrassing but the deer  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:05):**  sideswipe me and clean me out and so these are the things that you kind of learn as you're not  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:10):**  only planning stuff but also observing is that you need to go out and take a look at your crop  
**[1:06:15-1:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:15):**  plants understand what's going on and that will give you clues as to uh as to what is going on  
**[1:06:20-1:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:20):**  and therefore give you an idea as to what you need to do in order to take care of the problem and  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:25):**  there are many different ways of taking care of uh all of the problems that uh farmers run into  
**[1:06:30-1:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:30):**  when when planting crops what is a book or a resource that you recommend most often to growers  
**[1:06:35-1:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:35):**  um i don't uh i haven't recommended a book or a resource to a grower in a long time to be honest  
**[1:06:45-1:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:45):**  with you so there are a number of books that i have read um i look at them more as academic than  
**[1:06:50-1:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:50):**  anything else um i guess i haven't read the type of books that uh should be read by the farmers i  
**[1:06:56-1:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:06:56):**  mean i keep myself uh always looking for the cutting edge type of thing i'm not looking at  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:02):**  necessarily like picking up a book on how to raise tomatoes or something like that i'm looking for  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:06):**  something ridiculously complex because this is just you know the the problem that i've had and  
**[1:07:11-1:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:11):**  i've always had it's a birth defect is that we scientists we we like to make things more complex  
**[1:07:16-1:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:16):**  than they actually are and this is something that i haven't been able to shake so because of that i  
**[1:07:20-1:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:20):**  probably am not well read enough in order to recommend a a book a publication or anything like  
**[1:07:27-1:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:27):**  that in order to help a farmer one of my the things that i really love to do in this interview  
**[1:07:32-1:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:32):**  is part of it is to actually just go out there and talk so to talk to the farmers directly so  
**[1:07:37-1:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:37):**  it's i like it when it's not filtered i like it when i go and i talk to a hundred to a thousand  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:43):**  farmers at once i get a high from that type of thing because i can talk to them directly about  
**[1:07:49-1:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:49):**  their crop plants sometimes you need to talk one-on-one with them after the presentation is  
**[1:07:53-1:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:53):**  over when they kind of see where you're at and those are the things that i like rather than just  
**[1:07:57-1:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:07:57):**  kind of giving them a cookbook as to what they need to do which is usually what you find in a  
**[1:08:01-1:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:01):**  book i prefer to actually talk to them directly because each one has their own story to tell and  
**[1:08:07-1:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:07):**  their own uh problem uh as well so that's a long roundabout way of saying i'm just not able to  
**[1:08:12-1:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:12):**  answer your question john but good question nonetheless great what is the question you wish  
**[1:08:17-1:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:17):**  i would have asked that you would have liked to talk about um no no i think you asked some great  
**[1:08:21-1:08:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:21):**  questions right there i mean we touched upon probably the most important one and that is  
**[1:08:25-1:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:25):**  insects are really attracted to unhealthy plants and all of the extensions that come from that  
**[1:08:30-1:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:30):**  which we have we've touched upon some of them and i touch upon more in a in a more formal  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:35):**  presentation those are the type of things i think if you can get something like that out you you  
**[1:08:40-1:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:40):**  change the mindset of everyone people are no longer planting crops the same way that they did  
**[1:08:46-1:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:46):**  before and that is is to disseminate information is to talk to them about energy systems so that  
**[1:08:51-1:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:51):**  they understand how to raise a high energy crop talk to them about insects so that they understand  
**[1:08:57-1:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:08:57):**  that all of them are indicators they indicate to you what's going on with the plant they're not  
**[1:09:01-1:09:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:01):**  something to be fought against because this is the consensus not only in the scientific world  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:07):**  but among secular society as well too is that this is something that we just need to consign  
**[1:09:12-1:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:12):**  ourselves to do is to try and beat down the insects but uh if we take a look at that the  
**[1:09:16-1:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:16):**  whole mindset changes and i love seeing that change in the mindset way when people start  
**[1:09:21-1:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:21):**  thinking of ways of things in a very different way than they had done before and then their mind  
**[1:09:27-1:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:27):**  starts to go in that direction and they start bringing up points that are just pure genius  
**[1:09:32-1:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:32):**  because they're immediately able to apply it to their crop they understand oh yeah i mean i was  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:37):**  out the other day in a certain part of my field which was being attacked and i was in another part  
**[1:09:41-1:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=1:09:41):**  of the field and nothing was being attacked right there and this is making so much sense

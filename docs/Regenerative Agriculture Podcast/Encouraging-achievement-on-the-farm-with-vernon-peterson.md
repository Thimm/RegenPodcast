**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:02):**  I know that Vern doesn't like to be categorized and defined by the work that he's done, so  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:08):**  I'll just begin by asking him the question.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:11):**  Vern, who are you?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:13):**  I think I'm an encourager.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:15):**  You definitely are.

**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:18):**  I think I have the gift of encouragement, but others say it's the gift of irritation.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:25):**  But wherever it is, family, employees, suppliers, customers, I think that's my role.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:34):**  What is the difference between encouragement and irritation?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:39):**  The broad smile you have when you're putting your thumb in somebody's back, I think.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:45):**  I think what we have to do, everybody has their own possibilities, right?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:51):**  How do we get them to be able to achieve to their full potential, right?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:04:57):**  Whether that's our kids, whether that's our employees, whether that's our customers, how  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:02):**  do we help them be better?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:05):**  I think that if you come at it, John, from the perspective of I am here to give, that's  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:14):**  the difference.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:15):**  An irritator wants something, right?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:21):**  Thank you.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:22):**  So as we approach this conversation about soil health and farming for a bit of context,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:26):**  can you tell us a little bit about your operation and your background, what has brought you  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:30):**  here today?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:31):**  So we farm about 300 acres of stone fruit.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:35):**  We grow peaches, plums, nectarines, apricots.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:39):**  We pack fruit for about 80 of our neighbors, including beyond stone fruit, also pomegranates  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:47):**  in the fall and citrus all winter.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:52):**  We have 11 chicken houses, so it's kind of rare to have a livestock component, but we  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:05:58):**  grow organic chickens, a couple hundred thousand at a time.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:03):**  So that's what we do.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:04):**  We employ about 150 people year round.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:08):**  And what do you do on your operation that is unusual from many of the other growers  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:14):**  in the area?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:15):**  Well, it's all organic.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:19):**  I think what's unique about us, John, we've formed this alliance, and we make a bunch  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:25):**  of little farmers look like one larger farmer.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:29):**  Just helped a bunch of little guys be very successful.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:34):**  And that's tough to do, as you know, in this environment.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:38):**  I think that's what's different.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:41):**  In your alliance together, are you working together for marketing and sales?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:44):**  Are you cooperating in ways more than that?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:48):**  We're cooperating in so many ways.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:52):**  All the compliance issues, we work together so you can hire one person.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:06:59):**  You got to do food safety for the packing shed.

**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:04):**  If we're going to pay everybody to sit down and learn how to wash your hands after you  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:09):**  go to the bathroom, why not also talk about drink plenty of water on a hot day?  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:17):**  It takes like 1% more.

**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:28):**  It's delegated out, it gets done, and it's not a great burden on our farmers.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:34):**  I went off on three tangents there at once.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:37):**  Only three?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:38):**  What are some of the memorable moments that have led you to where you are today?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:43):**  Well, I graduated from high school in 75, first crop in 76.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:50):**  78, my father died.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:53):**  81, I got married.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:56):**  83 and five had two kids.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:07:59):**  Went broke in 85.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:01):**  In 90, started over.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:05):**  Managed for a large farm for that interim.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:08):**  Started over in 90.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:10):**  2002, we flipped to organic.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:14):**  And when you do organic, I think most of us, when we go down that path, we're looking for,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:19):**  what's the organic alternative to what I was doing conventionally, right?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:24):**  That's the way our brain flows.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:26):**  That's how my brain flowed.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:29):**  There isn't one.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:31):**  There isn't one.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:32):**  Organic's completely different.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:34):**  Organic's about life, organic's about encouraging the good guys.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:41):**  It's a whole different, and it's almost like an audible click you hear in a farmer's brain  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:47):**  when it happens.

**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:54):**  fungicide.

**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:08:57):**  What do we do in a year like this where it rained and rained and rained and didn't stop  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:00):**  raining until the end of May?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:02):**  And we're out there, well, the initial thing was copper and sulfur.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:09):**  Kill it.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:10):**  Kill the pathogen, right?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:12):**  We got our butt handed to us.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:15):**  We literally lost two orchards.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:19):**  Junk got in the wood.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:20):**  We couldn't get out, and we had to doze them.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:23):**  So the second year we flipped to life and spraying on probiotics, and it worked.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:33):**  It's still mind boggling, but getting that cell, getting that little flower coated with  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:40):**  good microorganisms prevents bad guys from getting established.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:46):**  And it does it clear on through.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:48):**  I've always said that it's much more powerful to be for something than it is to be against  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:53):**  something, and that's particularly true when we're working with living systems.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:09:56):**  So the entire framework of working with probiotics versus antibiotics is always very powerful.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:03):**  But it extends to everything.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:05):**  It extends down to the soil.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:07):**  It's a holistic, taking a holistic view of everything instead of dealing with all the  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:12):**  little parts and learning to be proactive instead of reactive.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:16):**  I think that's the biggest difference.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:19):**  An organic farmer doesn't have plan B, so you have to anticipate the challenge and be  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:26):**  ahead of it.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:28):**  It's wonderful to have this conversation about soil health and producing healthy plants,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:33):**  managing nutrition differently, but it's very important and necessary to learn the information  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:39):**  and to attend events such as this, but it's not enough just to have the information.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:44):**  You then have to effectively execute it.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:46):**  You have to make it work on your operation.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:48):**  And I know that one of the pieces that we've observed is that there are many growers who  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:54):**  are really, really good at executing.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:10:56):**  And I want to come back to that piece, but I wanted to use that as a frame for this conversation.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:04):**  I've also observed that the growers who are really good at getting things done generally  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:10):**  tend to be the growers who think very deeply about why they're doing what they're doing.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:15):**  And so my general observation has been that if you ask a grower, every single grower can  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:22):**  tell you what they do.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:25):**  Some of them can tell you how they do it, and only a few of them can tell you why they  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:31):**  do what you do.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:33):**  And I believe this is something you think very deeply about.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:35):**  So why do you do what you do?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:38):**  People.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:39):**  People.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:41):**  Why?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:42):**  So family.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:44):**  So my number one motivation is family.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:47):**  Number two is my employees, suppliers, customers.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:11:52):**  We have to create a biological, productive system so that all of those people can have  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:00):**  great lives.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:03):**  Our customers need to be eating really great food, and we've got to turn a profit at it.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:10):**  So the why is people.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:12):**  The why is people.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:13):**  And somehow, if you take care of...  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:17):**  It isn't just about taking care of people, but that is the why.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:22):**  The how, the what, those are more specific, efficiency.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:28):**  You have to be all of that.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:30):**  But I think the why is people, if that makes sense.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:34):**  So I think that's appropriate coming from someone who self-identifies as the encourager.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:39):**  But let's go back to the first part that I mentioned, that there are consistently some  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:45):**  farms that I've observed that are very effective at executing and getting things done.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:50):**  And I think this is really the heart of the conversation that we wanted to get to.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:54):**  From your perspective, what are the important elements that need to be in place in order  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:57):**  to be able...  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:12:59):**  We know that when we're managing plant nutrition and we're managing biological systems, such  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:13:05):**  critical windows of time.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:13:07):**  If you miss your window of opportunity, sometimes by a day or two, you've missed it for good.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:13:12):**  Which makes management and execution of paramount importance.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:13:15):**  And I think that's something that I've observed your operation doing very, very well.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:13:20):**  What needs to happen in order to have that system in place?

**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:14):**  If we come in with mechanical damage, I can't get it out in the shed.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:17):**  It ends up in the box then it decays.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:20):**  One of the magic about our product is everybody's working hard, but they're being real careful.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:28):**  And when they come up to the trailer, they don't just stack another one on top squish  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:34):**  because that's double dock.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:37):**  Right?  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:38):**  They take the extra ones off and put them in a box and set them up.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:42):**  It almost makes you cry.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:45):**  I kid you not to see people working so hard.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:51):**  Verna, this is a very important piece because I am very blessed and very fortunate because  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:19:57):**  I get the perspective of being able to observe a lot of different farms and a lot of different  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:01):**  growers.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:02):**  And consistently I've observed that those growers who are the most successful have extraordinary  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:08):**  relationships with their employees.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:11):**  And you mentioned a phrase a moment ago, Vern, that some people try to get things done as  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:17):**  cheaply as possible, but that you would prefer to, if I understood it correctly, you would  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:21):**  prefer to pay them better.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:23):**  I want to give them a chance to earn more.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:26):**  I want to give them the tools to earn more and I want to pay less.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:30):**  You want to win-win.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:32):**  Who's with me?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:33):**  Everybody.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:34):**  Yeah.

**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:36):**  So everybody on our farm and their family, guys, so those 150 employees, they've all  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:42):**  got access to a nurse practitioner.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:45):**  They've all got dental.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:46):**  They've all got vision.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:47):**  They've all got 4% matching 401k on top of four years ago is 1973 an hour.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:55):**  So now it's 20 something.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:56):**  That's impressive.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:20:58):**  But my cost-  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:00):**  Your cost has gone down.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:03):**  Guess who ain't got a labor problem?  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:07):**  You know?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:08):**  Guess where everybody wants to work.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:11):**  But it's so amazing how farmers can't get that through their head.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:15):**  And I have farmers won't do it.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:17):**  Send me people for 12 bucks an hour.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:20):**  You know?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:21):**  I've got crews that don't want the piece work.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:24):**  Guess why they don't want the piece work?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:26):**  They don't want to work that hard.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:28):**  So I send that farmer the $12 crew.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:32):**  You know?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:33):**  They just can't stomach writing the check for the 20 something an hour.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:40):**  So in this entire conversation about piece work and having really valuable employees  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:48):**  that are... They're not employees, but they really are a team that wants to contribute  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:51):**  to the entire farm.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:53):**  How has that affected your ability to execute and to implement all these various... In  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:21:59):**  addition to the tree management, irrigation and cultural management, weeding, the stuff  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:05):**  that is very time sensitive, the stuff that perhaps isn't piece work?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:10):**  What I find is if five days out of this week I made really good money and one day we're  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:16):**  going to go shovel Johnson grass, everybody grabs their shovel and shovels Johnson grass.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:22):**  You know?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:23):**  And we get a lot done.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:24):**  So it isn't like every day we're going to shovel Johnson grass, but we got to shovel  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:30):**  Johnson grass.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:31):**  It isn't going away by itself and we don't have Roundup.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:35):**  You know?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:36):**  We spend 15 grand shoveling Johnson grass.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:39):**  It's a new herbicide, organic herbicide called shovel.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:45):**  I've called it steel in the past.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:48):**  There is no resistance built up yet to this herbicide.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:52):**  It's a solid application of iron.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:54):**  And I would, somebody said, why not do it piece work?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:22:56):**  I would if I could figure out how to measure and publish it.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:01):**  Because if it was just, how do you know?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:04):**  This row's got a bunch, the next five don't have any.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:08):**  And if you don't go down three feet sometimes to get that last rhizome out, you're right  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:13):**  back where you were next month.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:15):**  So I haven't been able to, there you go.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:19):**  If you've got your, if you can figure out how to measure it and publish it, you can  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:24):**  apply piece work to any application and not just labor.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:29):**  You know, you've got to be applying it to all your productivity.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:35):**  You need to know whether that check to AEA is getting you a return, right?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:42):**  So you've got to do some tests in the packing shed.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:46):**  You know, we pull a box from Mary, then we pull a box from Jane.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:49):**  We enter it in an iPad.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:52):**  She's getting 56 cents a box.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:23:55):**  But to find out how much you earn today, next to the time clock, cleanest packer, dirtiest  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:02):**  packer.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:03):**  You go find your name and then you know how much you earned.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:06):**  You know, you may not give a rat's rear whether you're the cleanest packer at the Peterson  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:11):**  family, but you don't want to be the worst.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:13):**  That's human nature.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:15):**  And so you can apply this to the farmers.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:18):**  You know, every 10 minutes we pull a 25 piece sample off the cull line and we quantify and  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:26):**  we say, farmer Bob, you, we measure the weight coming in.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:31):**  We measure the weight going out.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:33):**  The difference is your culls.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:35):**  Farmer Bob, you lost this many pounds of fruit to this defect.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:40):**  This many to that defect, this many to that defect.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:43):**  You've got to measure and publish.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:45):**  Otherwise you're just saying, man, Charlie, you've got a lot of worms that's eating your  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:50):**  lunch.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:51):**  If he sees he lost 3000 pounds, that's 3000 bucks.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:54):**  What could he have done to fix that?  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:24:56):**  You know, but until you measure and publish, you don't, you're not getting anywhere.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:03):**  Tell me to shut up.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:05):**  Vern, there's many questions I want to ask in so many directions this conversation could  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:09):**  go, but I, I'd like to focus.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:12):**  We talked a little bit about the cost side, but how should farmers prioritize the revenue  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:19):**  side?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:20):**  What is important?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:21):**  And I think that this, I heard a comment this last week that was not new, but just the way  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:28):**  it came across kind of hit me in the face, like a two by four.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:31):**  It said that the definition of a commodity is where the market price equals the cost  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:37):**  of production.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:38):**  Or less.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:39):**  That's or less.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:42):**  And so why would you want to grow a commodity?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:46):**  That's one question.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:47):**  But I think another more relevant question for our equally appropriate question for us  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:51):**  to think about is how do we actually manage the price of the product that we are producing?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:25:57):**  So question, Vern, that's a question I would have for you.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:01):**  Most farmers, I believe do it backwards.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:04):**  They start with production and they move to sales.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:08):**  Am I right?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:11):**  I think that's where we're at.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:14):**  And it doesn't do me any good to be the cheapest raising farmer.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:18):**  So we have to start with sales.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:22):**  You need to sell it at a profit, then go grow it.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:26):**  I know that sounds crazy, but that's where you have to start.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:31):**  And in my world, it's about balance.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:34):**  So my world of stone fruit production, this week I have to have a yellow peach, a white  
**[0:26:41-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:41):**  peach, a yellow nectarine, a white nectarine, a red plum, a black plum, a pluot, and an  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:49):**  apricot in various volumes.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:52):**  And I have to have that this week.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:26:55):**  Storage can average the, we pick more today and not tomorrow.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:00):**  But this week I have to have that.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:03):**  A field of peaches produces for a week.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:07):**  That means I did all of that this week and I do it again next week.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:13):**  And I do it again the week after that.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:15):**  And I do it again the week after that.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:18):**  May to September, that's my world.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:22):**  And I can't do that by myself.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:24):**  So we have lots of little farmers and we get together and we say, like today, I know I'm  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:34):**  going to have a hole in nectarines in about 10 days.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:39):**  So if somebody wants to plant something, we got to find you a good nectarine that comes  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:46):**  about 10 days from today.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:49):**  That's my world, balance.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:51):**  It's all about balance.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:53):**  And here's why it's so profitable.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:27:56):**  If I just had peaches, very inorganic, they're not going to fill a truck with peaches.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:04):**  They got to fill a truck, in our case, with all of those stone fruit commodities.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:09):**  Plus I've got a partner doing blueberries and another one doing table grapes.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:13):**  And those all go in the same truck at the same price.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:17):**  That's worth three to five bucks more per box by having all of that on the truck going  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:23):**  to Earl's Organics back here.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:29):**  Start with sales.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:30):**  Then how do you differentiate yourself?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:33):**  The second most important thing is packaging.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:36):**  It isn't farming.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:38):**  Sell it, package it in a memorable way, in an effective way, in an efficient way, in  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:44):**  a way that meets the need.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:47):**  Maybe for this customer, they need things in a grab and go package.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:51):**  And you can eliminate their labor and increase their ring through by doing that for them.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:28:59):**  Maybe someone else likes to build displays.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:02):**  You have to be able to put it up all those ways.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:06):**  And it's very expensive.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:07):**  That packaging is expensive, the sorting, at least in my world.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:14):**  And to have the equipment to do the stone fruit and then the pomegranates and then the  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:20):**  citrus, it's the same people, same building, different applications.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:27):**  Then third is labor.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:29):**  So start with sales rather than starting with production.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:32):**  Focus on having really good packaging.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:34):**  And then I think the question that many growers ask themselves for the, or that should be  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:39):**  asking themselves for the crops they're producing is what are the characteristics that consumers  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:42):**  care about?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:44):**  And ultimately, what are the characteristics that you need to care about as a result of  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:48):**  that?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:49):**  Yeah, there's a real challenge.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:52):**  Because we don't sell food to people who eat food.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:55):**  Doesn't that suck?  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:58):**  That does.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:29:59):**  We sell food to people who sell food and don't want to discount anybody.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:04):**  It says in the thing here that I'm running a CSA called Abundant Harvest Organics.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:10):**  When I did until a year ago, April, we had 5,500 families up and down the state and it  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:17):**  was a hoot.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:18):**  In that case, everybody knew I marketed myself as Uncle Vern.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:24):**  Everybody knew Uncle Vern.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:25):**  They could email me.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:27):**  It was such a hoot and we were taking produce from the farm to the people.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:32):**  We've lost that in modern agriculture.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:36):**  So what's important to me today is to score a five out of 10 on appearance, flavor, and  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:48):**  durability.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:49):**  Durability?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:50):**  That sounds like a good recipe for cardboard.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:30:54):**  But if it does not make it to Toronto and get over the cash register, you with the store  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:31:02):**  in Toronto aren't going to buy it.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:31:04):**  So we've got to have those things then in a supply chain that's balanced.

**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:31:43):**  others might perhaps not believe to be true?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:31:47):**  We can feed the world organically and we can do it without an increase in cost.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:31:52):**  Yes.

**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:04):**  It wouldn't be producing the food.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:07):**  Because here's the secret, conventional agriculture isn't about, well, it's about cheaper, which  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:12):**  is why we have this problem, but it's not about cheaper production cost.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:18):**  It's about easier.

**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:44):**  Maybe eight or nine.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:46):**  The old farmer doesn't have an heir.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:49):**  You guys are different.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:50):**  That's why you're here trying to make things better, but that's the general case.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:54):**  So half the farmland is going to transfer.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:32:59):**  Half the farmland is going to transfer.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:03):**  Half the farmland is going to transfer, certainly in the next decade.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:10):**  No other way around it.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:12):**  Half the agricultural production, that means half go away, the other half doubled in size.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:20):**  Basic math.

**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:23):**  Or probably half went away and 10% of the other half can tuppled in size.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:31):**  It's a real deal.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:32):**  I'm on the bank board, farm credit bank board, and the loans we're writing aren't $300,000  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:39):**  and $500,000 loans anymore.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:42):**  They're $50 million loans.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:33:45):**  I haven't analyzed the most recent USDA census, but in the 2015 census in the US, fruit, nut,

**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:34:02):**  Of those, 6,923 had greater than half a million in annual revenue and that group produced  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:34:10):**  90% of the total supply chain.

**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:35:08):**  But the consumer isn't about cheap.

**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:44:03):**  One definition of success is where opportunity meets preparedness.

**[0:45:01-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:01):**  You have to be able to present a compelling story, and the consumer loves us.

**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:15):**  It's very true.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:17):**  And it's crazy.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:19):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:20):**  We score down there with used car salesman when you talk about agriculture, and we score  
**[0:45:27-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:27):**  with the clergy when you talk about farmers, and it's the same guy.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:35):**  But if the consumer wants us to be successful, they don't want us to be bankrupt.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:42):**  They want to pay us a good price for our food, but it's on us to show that we have a superior  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:50):**  product.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:51):**  How many of you here are familiar with the Bio-Nutrient Food Association?  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:57):**  A number of you are, but not nearly enough.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:45:59):**  So the Bio-Nutrient Food Association and the Real Food Campaign, a nonprofit organization  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:05):**  out of Massachusetts.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:07):**  Dan Kittredge is kind of the spokesperson of these organizations.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:11):**  And Dan has been passionate about this conversation of documenting food quality for over a decade.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:19):**  He and I have known each other.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:20):**  We've had this conversation on a continual basis.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:23):**  And Dan has been passionate and has recently been successful in developing a handheld,  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:29):**  non-destructive meter that can measure the nutritional profiles of virtually any crop  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:37):**  that you expose it to.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:39):**  So what does that mean, nutritional profile?  
**[0:46:41-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:41):**  Well, first let me say that they're still in the process of developing, but the spectrophotometer  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:49):**  can measure a signature of different wavelengths that are emitted that then correspond to different  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:56):**  nutrients and different elements.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:46:59):**  So their intention and their goal is to be able to measure the nutritional profile in  
**[0:47:06-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:06):**  terms of mineral assays, calcium, magnesium, boron, sulfur, et cetera, but then also all  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:12):**  of the important and beneficial plant secondary metabolites, the phytoalexins, the terpenoids,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:19):**  all these aromatic compounds that plants produce that provide flavor and aroma and immune benefits.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:25):**  So the desire and the intent is to be able to measure all of this non-destructively so  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:31):**  a consumer can measure on the grocery store shelf, a food buyer can use it to measure,  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:37):**  a farmer can use it to measure.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:40):**  They released the first prototype of this device last year, and I think there's about  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:45):**  a thousand or so units that are being used across the country.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:49):**  They're in the process right now of developing a library, a database of energy signatures  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:47:56):**  for these different crops that they can then correlate the signatures to specific nutritional  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:00):**  parameters.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:02):**  So what is missing right now and what still needs to be developed is the database.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:05):**  So the BioNutrient Food Association is looking for volunteers to use this device, collect  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:13):**  data in the field, and develop a database of signatures that we can then correspond  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:18):**  to specific nutritional profiles.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:20):**  When we have that database, we will be able to do exactly what Vern is describing, and  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:25):**  that then gives us the foundational framework to, as you described, Vern, to put together  
**[0:48:30-0:48:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:30):**  a marketing campaign based on nutritional quality.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:33):**  Now we can differentiate based on quality, and I will also say that just based on our  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:39):**  experience with SAP analysis, working with a lot of different growers, organic fruits  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:45):**  and vegetables that are produced in this country, about 40 percent of them are the absolute  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:51):**  best quality that you will find in the grocery store, because those are the growers that  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:56):**  really pay attention to soil health and nutrition.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:48:58):**  They try to do a really good job, and the remaining 60 percent are the worst quality  
**[0:49:03-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:03):**  in the grocery store, because those are the growers that manage organics by input substitution,  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:12):**  trying to use other control mechanisms to control diseases and insects.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:16):**  There's also organic by default instead of design, so you just don't do anything, and  
**[0:49:21-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:21):**  it's organic.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:22):**  Yeah, it's called organic by neglect.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:24):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:25):**  So we have time for a few questions if there are any.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:29):**  Actually, why don't you go ahead in the back.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:31):**  Have you thought about creating relationship with your customers directly, the end consumer?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:38):**  Yeah, I've done that.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:40):**  It's really hard.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:41):**  We have some retail partners that are excellent at it, and they want their customer to know  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:48):**  that the Peterson family grew this peach, but that's the rare exception.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:54):**  We did a thing like a—we pack Costco, we pack Walmart, we pack it all.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:49:59):**  So Costco goes out in a five or six pound consumer pack.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:03):**  We put a QR code on the end of it, click the QR code with your phone, and it'll take you  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:10):**  to our farm and show you all what wonderful people we are, right, and how to get ahold  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:15):**  of us and how to come visit and all of that.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:18):**  We put out about a million five of those boxes.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:24):**  Guess how many people clicked it?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:26):**  Yeah, five.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:27):**  It was something you could count on two hands.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:30):**  It was really—so it's a challenge.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:34):**  It's a real challenge.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:36):**  So I don't know how to do it.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:38):**  Yes, let's go here.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:41):**  I want to circle back to what you were talking about with the software and communication.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:44):**  I mean, first of all, congratulations for having 150 year-round employees in Stone Fruit,  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:49):**  and in Citrus and everything else.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:51):**  For something that is so seasonal when you have high crew demands for thinning and high  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:50:55):**  crew demands for picking, but the rest of the year it's not that 150 people, it's really  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:00):**  amazing to have a business where you've been able to have that continuity.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:05):**  When it comes to software, it's enough of a struggle to find a financial software that  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:11):**  will even do the farm itself, much less communicate that back to the decision makers.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:17):**  So have you—and the cost of making your own software or paying somebody to make your  
**[0:51:23-0:51:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:23):**  own software is not insignificant.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:26):**  So have you come up with your own software for that?  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:29):**  Are you using a commercial package?  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:30):**  And how do you communicate back to those decision makers or even to the rest of the crew what—the  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:35):**  metrics that you're using based on that check that you wrote to that employee or that cost  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:40):**  center?  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:41):**  Are you using an amalgamation of different pieces or are you using one particular package?  
**[0:51:45-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:45):**  Yeah, so we use for about 30 years a software called—it was BizBooks, now it's called  
**[0:51:54-0:51:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:54):**  AgBooks.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:51:55):**  I commissioned—I paid a guy to go find me something better and I couldn't.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:00):**  So BizBooks is—or AgBooks now, guy's name is Bob Wiens, he's a really great guy.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:09):**  And his stuff works and he answers his phone.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:12):**  So whatever that's worth.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:14):**  It's got the reports you need, it's got the formulas, it does it by group, it does it  
**[0:52:19-0:52:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:19):**  by individual, you can set up a thousand cost centers or enterprises if you like.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:26):**  It's really challenging to be in that business because California keeps changing the rules  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:32):**  and they change them retroactively.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:35):**  So it's like they're determined to kill us but we're hard to kill.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:42):**  So for instance, break times.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:44):**  If you're piece work, you've got to be paying the piece work rate during break.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:51):**  And they made that retroactive, cost me 75 grand to go back two and a half years and  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:57):**  pay people.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:52:58):**  I won't go there.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:01):**  But—  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:02):**  We've got time for one more question and then I know Vern and I will both be available  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:06):**  here after.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:07):**  So let's go into the back to the microphone.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:09):**  Yes, thank you.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:10):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:11):**  You know, if we're going to go from a few percent to 50, 60, 80 percent, it has to be  
**[0:53:18-0:53:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:18):**  more affordable than it is today given especially the distribution of income.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:28):**  In this country, quantity is emphasized over quality and then there's a lot of waste as  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:32):**  well.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:33):**  So is there some way in which quality can be made more sexy and in place of quantity  
**[0:53:40-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:40):**  the heaping plate for enough if it is really good?  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:47):**  And I wonder whether that's the formula along with less waste so farmers can be paid more  
**[0:53:54-0:53:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:54):**  than they are today.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:53:58):**  At the same time, we eat better than we do today with less waste.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:02):**  I don't know whether that's a possible approach.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:05):**  Vern, what are your thoughts?  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:09):**  We've been really successful creating number two and three box so that you can get most  
**[0:54:16-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:16):**  of the stuff sold.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:19):**  You know, the cosmetic defects and things.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:22):**  With organic, I haven't been successful.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:24):**  We still pack.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:25):**  I still have a handful of conventional growers who want me to pack their fruit and they just  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:31):**  can't switch to organic so I still do some conventional.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:35):**  We haven't been able to accomplish that to the same level with conventional.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:42):**  But there's a kind of a movement right now, the ugly fruit, the, you know, the, there's  
**[0:54:49-0:54:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:49):**  several companies we work with that specialize in that number two stuff.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:54:56):**  I don't know if that helps you, sir, but yeah, it's a great ideal.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:02):**  I think there is one element of that ideal that it would be useful for us to understand  
**[0:55:08-0:55:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:08):**  collectively, which is that unhealthy fruit or, and I could say low nutritional integrity  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:16):**  fruit rots.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:20):**  High nutritional integrity fruit doesn't rot, it dehydrates.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:24):**  It will dehydrate but not rot.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:27):**  And so there, when we have this entire conversation about food waste and food loss, food waste,  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:35):**  it's something like 40 or 45% of the entire supply chain.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:39):**  So that's a huge amount of, a huge proportion of the quantity in the food that people grow,  
**[0:55:45-0:55:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:45):**  that farmers grow never reaches people's plates.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:49):**  And you could actually say that that is a quality problem, that it is an attritional  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:55:55):**  problem and that if we produced higher nutrition food, a greater proportion of it would reach  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:01):**  people's plates.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:02):**  Not all of it, that wouldn't account for all the loss, but I think it would account for  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:05):**  a very significant factor, a very significant amount of that loss.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:09):**  So Vern, I want to thank you for joining us and for sharing your thoughts.

**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:37):**  And since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers to help them do just  
**[0:56:42-0:56:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/encouraging-achievement-on-the-farm-with-vernon-peterson/#t=0:56:42):**  that.

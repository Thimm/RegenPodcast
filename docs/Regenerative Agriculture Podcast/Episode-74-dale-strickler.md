### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:27:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we talk about the  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:04):**  agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  health and public health. My guest for this episode is Dale Strickler from Green Cover  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:15):**  Seed and from many other places as well, not just Green Cover Seed, but I think when we  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  look geographically at all the places Dale has been, then it would make for an interesting  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  map. So Dale, thank you very much for joining us. I've been really been looking forward  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  to this conversation. Thank you for having me. Yeah, you have lots of experience on cover  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:35):**  crops and on regenerating soil in lots of different landscapes and ecosystems. Can you  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  tell us a little bit about your personal story and kind of the background, the context of  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  your work and what you're really passionate and inspired about? I grew up on a farm, Southeast  
**[0:00:53-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  Kansas. I actually recently moved close to where I grew up as is a little town named  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  Colony, Kansas. Father was a basically a sharecropper for a long time and then eventually bought  
**[0:01:08-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  land and and so we had hogs and cattle and crops and occasionally sheep, ducks, goats,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  the whole old McDonald thing. So we were very diversified and went to school at Kansas State  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  University and got a couple of bachelors there and then a masters and then taught agronomy  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  at a community college for 15 years and thoroughly enjoyed that experience, but found it's hard  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:41):**  to raise a family in the manner I'd like to on a teaching salary. So I entered private  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  industry and I worked for Land O'Lakes, Agri Alliance, you know, all these different, you  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  know, permutations of Land O'Lakes that they had in agronomy at the time. It was a great  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  learning experience as well. Got to learn, work with a lot of really good people and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  worked for Starseed for a while, and Valent USA. And now I'm with Green Cover, which is,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  I don't know if I could write a job that really fit me better personality wise or interest  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:24):**  wise. I've always been fascinated by cover crops. I've been fascinated by soil. What  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  makes soil better? A number of experiences early on in my life that made me very interested  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  in soil. And when I went away to college, it was, you know, every summer where I live  
**[0:02:45-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:45):**  now we get about 36 inches of rain, which should be fully adequate. But every summer  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  our crops would just burn up. Wow. You know, I just thought we didn't get enough rain because  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  all summer long, boy, we could use the rain, boy, we could use the rain. And just like  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:04):**  yesterday, I was driving through and the area where I live now, we only got into the field  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  to start planting seven days ago. And yesterday, a hundred degree day, the corn is already  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  rolling. Wow. And that's seven days after being saturated. Seven days after being too  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  wet to plant, we've got corn that's suffering. And so they say here, we're always one week  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  away from a drought. And it's true. It's like, I just grew up assuming that's normal. You  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  know, this is how it is everywhere. You got to have rain every week or you're in trouble.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  And then I moved away and went to places where they have this stuff called soil. And like,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  you mean you can go a whole month without rain or two months without rain, your crops  
**[0:03:58-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  don't just die? Wow, this is great. And so I looked at our really heavy clay soil. I  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  mean, brickmaking has historically been a huge industry in this area because the soil  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  is better for making bricks than it is for making crops. And it's like, I don't like  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  just accepting that's the way things are. And so it's like, how can I fix the soil?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  What can I do? Well, the answer obviously is organic matter. How do you increase your  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  soil organic matter? Well, if you open a garden book, it says, well, you import, you know,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  all these lawn clippings or leaf mold or...  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  What you can do if you're farming 100 acres.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:46):**  Right. It's like, you know, and what advice is that on the planetary scale? You know,  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:52):**  are we going to go to different planets and take all their organic matter and bring it  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  back here? If we're going to seriously impact agriculture with organic matter, where's it  
**[0:05:03-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  going to come from? And so that makes it necessary to grow the organic matter on site. And each  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  and every acre gets enriched with more organic matter. How do you do it economically? How  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  do you do it in an environmentally responsible manner? How do you do it without taking from  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  one field and robbing one field to enrich another? And so that kind of became my challenge.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:34):**  So you've been working with that challenge for a number of years now, and I'd like to  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  hear a bit about the results that you've experienced. What have you observed with this soil that  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  does better for making bricks than growing crops?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:48):**  Well, I just moved back here for a while, but my brother has been farming family ground  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  along with my father who now in a nursing home, but a couple of the practices that I  
**[0:06:01-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  really promote. One is really minimizing tillage, no till where you can. And the other is continual  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  flow of root exudates in the soil with cover crops or perennial crops. It's hard to get  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  quantifiable results. And sometimes measuring soil organic matter doesn't always measure  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  soil function. It's like a savings account. The most important thing is that savings account  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  getting bigger or is it getting smaller? And what's your cash flow? Things like that. But  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  I can relate an experience that the farm I had where I previously had a small ranch for  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  20 years. When I bought the place, it was an irrigated corn field. One field had been  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:53):**  continuous corn for 42 years prior to my buying it. And then within, well, I instituted no  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  till and some other things, cover cropping. And then I decided that I would convert it  
**[0:07:09-0:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  to an irrigated pasture. I was told subsurface drip irrigation. It was furrow irrigated,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:18):**  converted it subsurface drip irrigation. And I was told at one time I had the only subsurface  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  drip irrigated pasture in the entire world. I have no idea if that's true or not, but  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  I got my irrigation equipment from Netafim. And one of the Netafim executives said, there  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  is no drip tape irrigated pasture anywhere in the world. So I guess that was rather unique.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  But the drip tape allowed me to eliminate tillage and also to put a perennial crop out  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:50):**  there with, you know, on the flat. I didn't like having the intentional gullies out there.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  I'd like to talk about drip irrigated pasture for a little bit. I'm of the persuasion that  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  if people manage their pastures as well as they manage their cash crops, their pastures  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  would be more profitable. They would be more profitable than their cash crops, particularly  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:11):**  in the case of corn and soybeans. I agree. You mentioned that you're doing drip irrigation  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:16):**  pastures to eliminate tillage. How do those two dots connect? Well, furrow irrigation  
**[0:08:22-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  was, I remember, you know, I was so excited when I bought this farm and I began farming  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  just like everyone else in the area, you know, furrow irrigation group soybeans, decided  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  to grow soybeans because it had been corn for 42 years and well, I'll start rotating.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  Did the irrigation, the furrow irrigation, setting the siphon tubes and I went down to  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  the bottom of the field to see, you know, where the water was coming out the bottom  
**[0:08:54-0:09:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  end of the field and there was a big pile of soil that was there. And then after my  
**[0:09:02-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:02):**  first season, all that soil was now in the county ditch and a county crew came along  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  in the wintertime and scraped the ditch and took trucks and put it back out in my field.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  Like how often do you guys do this? Oh, every few years. I'm like, oh my gosh. Wow. How  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  devastating is this furrow irrigation to my soil quality and I grid sampled the field  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  and the phosphorus test just stair stepped down away from, I mean, all my soil was moving  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  downhill and it was really impactful. So I decided, first of all, I got to get rid of  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  the furrow irrigation. When I bought the farm, I had 17 acre inches allotted of irrigation.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:53):**  And then that year, the year I bought it, we had water dispute with Nebraska. The river  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:59):**  got my irrigation from the original source, dried up. My irrigation allotment got cut  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  back to five acre inches. And I mean, that's essentially two waterings with furrow irrigation.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  It's useless. I said, well, this, this is the future. So I'm going to learn to stretch  
**[0:10:16-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:16):**  my water that involves no till. The subsurface drip was more than sufficient. And the neat  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  thing about putting that to pasture and drip irrigation pastures, great marriage because  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  I mean, perennial vegetation just is great. But one of my goals was, was to restore my  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  soil, the furrow irrigation, the tillage, you know, it just, it doesn't do soil any  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  favors. When I planted the pasture and the pasture was Eastern gamma grass, alfalfa,  
**[0:10:54-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  checkery tree foil, a whole complex blend. My soil organic manner was 1.9%, which is  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  fairly typical for tilled fields in the area around 2%. I took a soil test just recently  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  and after I sold the farm, it was of course tilled and put back to back to corn production.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  And yeah, that's a hard kill.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  Let's go, let's go, let's go back and mine it again.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  It did provide me an opportunity though, because the ultimate measure of land quality in a  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  farmer's eyes, well, how many bushel corn can this acre grow? It's like the hundred  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  meter dash for, you know, how fast are you? Well, how fast do you run the hundred meter  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:40):**  dash? How productive is this soil? How many bushel of corn can it raise? So I'll have  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  an opportunity to find that out. But it also gave me an opportunity to soil sample it because  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:53):**  Eastern gamma grass is, it's very clumpy, has an extremely dense root system. We tried  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:00):**  to soil sample it, actually used a hydraulic probe, stuck it in the ground and the truck  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:07):**  went up in the air. The probe would not go in the soil. It was so dense with roots.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:14):**  Sounds to me like you had compaction issues.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  No, no. It was not compaction. It was roots. And you know, it's like, oh my gosh, what,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  what is the organic matter on this place? Well, once it was tilled up, and I don't know  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:31):**  how many tillage passes it took, but it had to be a lot. I went out there and grabbed  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  a sample and 8.7% organic matter in 15 years.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  In 15 years. So that's a-  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  So one, nine to eight, seven in 15 years.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  So 6.8% gain in 15 years, round up to seven. It's roughly a half a percentage point per  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  year.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  Roughly a half percentage point a year. And that's just the surface six inches. I dug  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  a trench in there. I had to repair a leak and I said, you know, while we're at it, let's  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  just see how deep these roots go. So the backhoe operator went nine feet. He said, that's all  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  the farther I can go. We've got safety things, you know, collapse. You know, we have to start  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  and I said, well, I don't want to stair step down. So just reach in there, dig a little  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  hole. And there were roots in abundance, nine feet down on this gamagrass.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  I know you and I have both been told that it is impossible to raise your soil organic  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:39):**  matter. There are still soil scientists today who will say, hear that story I just told  
**[0:13:46-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:46):**  you and call me a liar. So that that is impossible. So why did it happen?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  It's very common for people to say, and there are different opinions, of course, but there's  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:00):**  still the prevailing perspective that you can't increase organic matter beyond what  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  the native original profile was and pick a number. Let's say that native profile was  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  400 years ago or whenever it was. And yet there are any number of farmers who have had  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  a very different experience from that. Yes. Yeah. And native in this area runs six to  
**[0:14:22-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  seven percent organic matter. So in 15 years, I was able, not that I'm anything special,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  but a C4 perennial grass with, you know, very productive legume companion crops and biodiversity  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  and managed grazing, you know, daily moves and so forth. Yeah. You can accomplish some  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  amazing things in soil quality. And I'm sure you know the math a lot better than I do.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  But if climate change is an actual thing that we're facing from too much carbon dioxide  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  in the atmosphere, you can do the math. It would not take a whole lot of acres worldwide  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:03):**  to make this change, to suck all the extra CO2 we've put in in the atmosphere in the  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  last 200 years and put it in the soil. And then whether you believe in climate change  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  or not as a threat, all that carbon in the soil is a good thing. All that carbon in the  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:22):**  soil is a good thing from an agriculture perspective. I think different people have different perspectives  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:27):**  on climate change. But leaving that hot button topic to the side for the moment, the  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:33):**  one thing that all of us as farmers do care about is water and water cycling. And when  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  we recognize that, as Walter Yenny and others have so brilliantly described, that once we  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:48):**  restore the carbon cycle and we store organic matter in our soil, it's not just about water  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:52):**  holding capacity in our soil, although that is also interesting. What is even more important,  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  I believe, is restoring the small water cycle, restoring local rainfall consistency. I'm  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  still a very young man, but in our local region where I grew up, I remember 15 years ago,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  20 years ago, rainfall being consistent every eight to 10 days, unless there were occasional  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  severe drought years. There was some annual variation, but I would say six years out of  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  eight, we had very consistent rainfall. That is gone. I remember this quote from Jerry  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:29):**  Bernetti. He used to say that we don't have a climate anymore. We just have vagaries of  
**[0:16:33-0:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  the weather. And that's come about. We don't recognize this because many of us aren't meteorologists  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:43):**  and don't connect all the dots, but this has really come about as a result of a dysfunctional  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  carbon cycle. So when we restore soil carbon, we also restore the rainfall cycle as well.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:54):**  Yeah, I agree. I tell people when they ask me who are not familiar with Kansas, what's  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  the weather like in Kansas or what's the climate like in Kansas, I say, oh, it's a desert where  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  it floods a lot. And that's true. Like you said, we used to have gentle rains in spring  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:16):**  and fall and then thunderstorms in the summer. And it used to snow in the winter. Now, hardly  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  ever snows in the winter. We get thunderstorms punctuated by long periods without rain, you  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  know, intense thunderstorms, long periods without rain, it seems like. And old time  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  farmers say, I don't think the climate's changing, but the weather sure is getting funny. It  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  is. Yeah, it does seem to be making, you know, I don't believe in climate change, but this  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  weather sure is getting funny. Yeah. And I think that's true. We do seem to be seeing  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  more intense rainfall with less frequency. I don't think many people would argue that.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:58):**  I haven't found anyone that would yet at this point. And in fact, even if they would desire  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  to argue that the data indicates differently, as Jerry Hatfield has eloquently pointed out.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  So in addition to the experiences on your own farm, you've also had the privilege of  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:11):**  working with lots of different growers in many different types of environments and ecosystems  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  implementing cover crops. What are some of the memorable moments or remarkable experiences  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:19):**  you've had that really stand out in your memory? Oh, gosh, I've had so many. I remember Keith  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  Thompson. I spoke at a little farmer meeting about cover crops and Keith Thompson spoke  
**[0:18:34-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  about no till. And then we spoke just a little bit about marrying the two practices. And  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  this was a long time ago, and years and years ago, and I was just starting to make these  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  changes on my own farm. And Keith told me, he said, you know what, you'll find out about  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  combining no till and cover crops, said your ground is going to stay wet longer and dry  
**[0:19:03-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  out quicker. Keith, that's an oxymoronic statement. That's mutually exclusive. That doesn't work.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  He said, you will know what I mean in about five years. And sure enough, I discovered  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:20):**  what he meant. The soil does hold moisture longer, but it also becomes, it doesn't dry  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  out quicker, but it does become plantable quicker because the cover crop pulls moisture  
**[0:19:32-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  out of the surface. Yeah. And it, you know, all the bad things about planting in the mud,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  the sidewall smearing, the seed furrow, the seed trench cracking open, you know, when  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  it dries out, the compaction, all the problems with planting too wet just kind of diminish  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  over time. And, oh wow, that's cool. You know, another opportunity thing that I saw, I went  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  to visit Shane New, who's now with Understanding Ag, and Shane's a good friend of mine for  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:11):**  a while. And he just culled me out of the blue one time. I went over to visit him and  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  he showed me this pasture, fescue pasture, where he had taken, essentially he had summer  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  annual cover crops and he had some seed left over in his drill. He said, I don't want to  
**[0:20:28-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:28):**  feed mice with this. And it's too late at night. I don't want to run the shop back and  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  clean that drill out. I'm just going to make enough passes that it empties the drill. Here's  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  this fescue pasture here. So he just drilled it out in the fescue to get rid of it and  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  not expecting any results. And it was just a winter-grazed fescue patch close to the  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  house for wintering animals. That stuff grew and grew like crazy and made a huge amount  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  of biomass. And then you'd think that would choke out that fescue. No, the fescue grew  
**[0:21:09-0:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  so much better under that canopy. So it just really, really changed the productivity of  
**[0:21:18-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:18):**  that pasture. It got me thinking about sunlight and sunlight capture. I think we really, really  
**[0:21:27-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  overestimate our ability to capture sunlight. And so much of our agronomic systems just  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  don't capture sunlight at all. If you look at corn-soybean rotation, how many months  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:42):**  out of the year do we actually capture sunlight? It's only 60 days or so of peak period. It  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  actually for corn, it's 45 days of peak photosynthesis. Yeah. I mean, you said a pasture can be more  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  profitable than a cornfield. Well, the unfair advantage of the pasture is that you can design  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  that pasture to capture sunlight over a much longer period of time. You can operate at  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  peak photosynthesis for a long period of time. You can't on a cornfield. If you are growing  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  corn in a monoculture, no cover crops, no companions, you are not operating at peak  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  photosynthesis, but just a small fraction of the year. And that experience really made  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:29):**  me start thinking about our solar efficiency. And of course, that, you know, a cool season  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  grass does not operate at peak efficiency in July and August. So what Shane did was  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:43):**  he introduced some C4 warm season species that could make better use of that sunlight  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  in the heat of summer period. You know what people in fescue pasture areas call summer  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:57):**  slumps. Why not let a more productive plant species get first crack at that sunlight?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  And then it got me thinking about temperature relations. How come that fescue grew better  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  underneath that canopy than it did in full sunlight? Well, fescue grows better in October  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  than it does in July, even though there's half the sunlight. I don't know the actual  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:24):**  fraction, but there's far less sunlight in October than there is in July. So by putting  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:29):**  that canopy over that, it essentially, as far as the fescue is concerned, it changed  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  the July day into an October day. Less sun, but 20 degrees cooler. And it was amazing.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:42):**  There's lots of dynamics in play there. And I think your comment about combining different  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  species, warm season grasses, I shouldn't say species, but different types, warm season  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  grasses, cool season grasses, legumes, and so forth is an important framework to keep  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  in mind when we think about developing different combinations and so forth. But when we think  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  about photosynthetic efficiency, I've been beating the drum for a decade that our plants  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:10):**  are only photosynthesizing at 15 to 20% of their inherent photosynthetic potential. And  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  often enough that people, they understand intellectually that that's the case, but it  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  hasn't really penetrated what that actually means for plant performance. And you're describing  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:29):**  a couple of different aspects. One is having plants present during all the days where photosynthesis  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:34):**  is possible, that are capable of capturing that sunlight. So it's extending the window,  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:39):**  if you will, of photosynthesis.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:41):**  The duration of photosynthesis. Yeah.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  Yeah. And which is very important. And then there's also what you described with fescue  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  is that you can increase the photosynthesis of a plant based on the environment that it's  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  in and based on its nutritional profile.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  It sure added to the productivity of that pasture. I'll tell you that. And that was  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:58):**  a real eye opener there. You assume it's like the elephant that, you know, when you take  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  a baby elephant and you tie it to a stake and it pulls and it pulls and it can't get  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  away. And then that elephant as an adult, you just put it to a little stake in the ground  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:16):**  that it could pull out in a flash, but it doesn't because it assumes that it's impossible.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  And I think we are, we are so often elephants tied to a stake.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:28):**  I love that.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:29):**  Because we have put limitations. That's the maximum we can do with this. And you hear  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  that said, well, that's the best we can do around here. Like, and everywhere you go,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  farmers use that term around here and that won't work around here. That won't work around  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  here. You can't do that around here. And like the laws of physics change, you know, within  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  30 miles of their house.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah. And if a farmer five miles away is successful in implementing something, oh, it rained more  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  over there or less or whatever.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah. And it's basically just a rationalization of the mental limitations that we put on ourselves.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:10):**  I finally found, and I do this in presentations sometime, I give them a map of where around  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  here actually is. I've looked for the place for years and years. And around here is one  
**[0:26:24-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  side of the property boundary is a left ear and the other side is right ear. That's where  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  around here exists. And that is, you are right, that is a place where nothing ever works.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  Because we have put those limitations on ourselves. And you talk about the guys that win the national  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  corn yield contest and like, oh gosh, you can't do that around here. You know, it's  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:51):**  like, you know, none of those guys have neighbors that are producing 600 bushel corn. I'm sure  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  their neighbors are saying, oh, that won't work around here either. And then you think  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:02):**  how amazing 600 bushel corn is. And then you realize, like you said, corn plants only operating  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  at peak photosynthesis for 45, 60 days out of the year. Like how much more can we derive  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  from our land? And I think one of the biggest mental changes a farmer can make is stop thinking  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  about I raise corn or I raise soybeans or I raise cattle or oranges or blueberries or  
**[0:27:30-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:30):**  whatever your crop is. And say, my goal, my job is to harvest sunlight and harvest rainfall.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  And extract nitrogen from the atmosphere. And have gas exchange in my soil. You know,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:47):**  pull oxygen into my soil and exhale carbon dioxide out of my soil and to capture that  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:52):**  carbon dioxide back in your canopy. When you start thinking of your goals as optimizing  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:59):**  your ecosystem function, you know, maximizing photosynthesis through solar capture and carbon  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  dioxide capture, harvesting rainfall, biologically fixing nitrogen, then all of a sudden you  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:13):**  start seeing all the tremendous waste that we currently have in agriculture and you think  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  what percentage efficiency are we operating at now? It's ridiculously low. And when you  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  see all this waste, you see opportunity.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  It's ridiculously low. You know, I think if we were to look at our production and productivity  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:36):**  from a global macro perspective, we get caught up in what are yields per acre and the marketing  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:43):**  mantra that has been developed by agribusiness to use farmers to do the marketing for them  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:48):**  that we are feeding the world. But in fact, if you started looking at measuring yield  
**[0:28:54-0:29:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  and measuring productivity in terms of calories per acre and grams of protein per acre, all  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:02):**  of a sudden you would realize that we are actually doing a very poor job of harvesting  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:06):**  sunlight and converting that into calories and protein and that there is a lot of untapped  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  opportunity left on the table. So it's a different perspective than looking at it purely in terms  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  of bins and bushels per acre.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:18):**  You grow up thinking, you know, we're Americans, we're the most efficient people in the world.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  We put a man on the moon, you know. Yeah, we have some exceptional technological developments  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  and we see ourselves as the most efficient farmers in the world and think, well, how  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  are we measuring that efficiency? Well, I drive by the billboard all the time. One Kansas  
**[0:29:41-0:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:41):**  farmer feeds 155 people plus you. So we're efficient because one farmer feeds all these  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:49):**  people. But when you look, like you said, when you look at calories or grams of protein  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:56):**  per acre, we're miserably inefficient. We're not harvesting sunlight. We're not harvesting  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  rainfall. Every time it rains, the river comes up. And so how much of the rainfall that I  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:11):**  know in my area of our 36 inches, a miserably poor percentage actually gets in the soil  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  and stays in the soil to grow crops.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:21):**  I think because we are in this developed country, in this Western civilization here in the United  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  States, many of us readily lose sight of what agriculture looks like in the majority of  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  the world and the rest of the world. And I think it would be wise for us to remember  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  occasionally that when we look at global agriculture as a whole, this type of agriculture that  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  we are all familiar with that we today call conventional or commercial agriculture, mainstream  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  or whatever you want to call it, it's mainstream here. That type of agriculture uses 70% of  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  all the inputs globally in both terms of fuel and fertilizer and so forth. It uses 70% of  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  the total inputs and it produces 30% of the total production as compared to small scale,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:12):**  small holder agriculture, which is most of the rest of the world.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:15):**  So you think about what that means. That means that smaller scale, small holder agriculture  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  uses 30% of the inputs to produce 70% of the output. And all of a sudden it starts raising  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  some question marks about the real efficiency of the system that we're actually using.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:31):**  You know, of course, a lot of those small holder farms are farmed with hand labor and  
**[0:31:38-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  hand labor allows you to do, you can do things on foot you cannot do with a big tractor.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  We think that intercropping or companion cropping is a new concept. No, it's an ancient concept  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  that we have completely forgotten about in the industrialized part of the world because  
**[0:32:00-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:00):**  you know, and intercropping was common as recently as 100 years ago, you know, before  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  mechanized combines. It was very common that you would put pumpkins in corn after the last  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  cultivation to provide basically post harvest, you get two crops off the same and the cattle  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:21):**  could pasture pumpkins and corn stalks at the same time after the corn was handpicked.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  Of course, once mechanical combines come around, people stop doing that. Once residual herbicides  
**[0:32:34-0:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  came out. Yeah, we do a better job growing corn, but we do a poorer job harvesting sunlight.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:42):**  And that's the ultimate measure of efficiency. We have the wrong metrics by which we judge  
**[0:32:49-0:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  our our standard in really the acres farmed per person. I think that is a negative. It's  
**[0:32:58-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:58):**  like on that same billboard, each farmer feeds 155 people plus you, they ought to say 12  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  families farm this land at one time and now it's farmed by one. And that's why our small  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:14):**  towns are drying up. And the rural areas are becoming impoverished. We've actually lost  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:21):**  efficiency when you when you look at the true metrics. Something else actually that I think  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  we should look at from a true metrics perspective, given the changing world that we live in,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  I don't think we should just exclusively measure calories or protein per acre. I think instead,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  we should look at calories and protein production per gallon of water. And how much water do  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  we actually keep and utilize. And all of a sudden, that really amplifies our water use  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  efficiency and and the way that different crops respond to that as well. So yeah, that's  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:56):**  that's another interesting perspective to keep in mind. I've really enjoyed the books  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  that you've written. I know that you have another book coming out. We want to talk about  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:02):**  that a little bit as well. One of the observations you made that really caught my attention was  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  your photo of you at the moral plots. Can you tell us a little bit about that? What  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  was happening? What was going on? I had an opportunity with my boss, Keith Burns. We  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  traveled east towards your direction and went to meet with some customers and business partners  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:26):**  that we have in Indiana. Keith asked me, where would you like to stop along the way? And  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  one of the places I said was the moral plots because that's the longest running continuous  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  experiment field in the northern hemisphere, I believe that people may argue that I don't  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  know but that that's what I've read. We stood there and there's just this distinct change  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  in elevation. I mean, this is tabletop flat, surrounded by buildings and trees. So there's  
**[0:34:57-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  really no water movement. There's no wind. And the tilled area within that plot, what  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  did it look like in the picture? I would guess two feet lower elevation compared to the grassy  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  strips around it. Those 150 years ago, 170, whenever they started those plots, that was  
**[0:35:24-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  all the same elevation. But that farmed area has subsided. It has sunken like a bathtub.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  Now the whole thing ponds water because it is a lower elevation than everything around  
**[0:35:38-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  it. And so what happened? Well, and gosh, I posted that picture on Facebook. Oh, man,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  the comments started coming in and said, oh, that's erosion. No, there's no place for it  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  to go. Water doesn't even run off the spot. It sits there like it's a bathtub. And said,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  oh, that's wind erosion. No, you don't, you'd have to see the thing. It's surrounded by  
**[0:36:06-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  a hedge. And it's just simple soil subsidence. So what did the soil lose? And obviously,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  some of it was soil organic matter, but the other was pore space. I watched some of your  
**[0:36:23-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  things on gas exchange in soil and wow, what a sight to drive home that concept is that  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  how much the soil has lost. I don't know what percentage of that is due to loss of organic  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  matter, how much of it's due to loss of pore space. But it's just such a striking visual,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:43):**  very impactful to me. Yeah, it is. And you think about soil losing two feet, let's be  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  really generous. And let's say that at the beginning before tillage, it was comprised  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  of 50% pore space, which is I think, that's reasonable, that's achievable. That's the  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  statistics that John Brown and others have been sharing from Gabe Brown's ranch and others.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  So if you have 50% pore space, then that means to lose two feet of elevation, you now have  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:13):**  compacted into the remaining two feet, all the slow that was originally in four feet.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  And what does that do for water holding capacity? What I mean, as you said, the water now ponds  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  there because it probably has less opportunity to infiltrate and you no longer have good  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:25):**  gas exchange. That's just, I'm really struck by the statistics from Iowa, that the state  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:31):**  of Iowa loses two pounds of topsoil for every pound of corn produced. I haven't done the  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  math for other states, but I have no reason to believe that the data is significantly  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  different for most other states in the Corn Belt. That is kind of a punch in the gut to  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  realize that you're losing two pounds of topsoil for every pound of corn. That means soil is  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  your biggest export. It's double your export of grain. And you're sending that down the  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  Mississippi River every year. So that is kind of a big deal. But then to also realize that  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  not only are you sending it down the river, because what happens when you have that subsidence  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  and that collapse of soil structure, you now are also losing the available soil for the  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  crop roots to interact with because they no longer can interact with the bulk soil environment  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  in the same way.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  I saw the results of a very, very long term tillage versus no till study out in western  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:27):**  Kansas. Been going on for 20 years, something like that. And they saw the results. They  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:34):**  measured all these different parameters and the long term no till was out producing the  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:40):**  tillage field two to one. You know, an arid environment, you would expect that no till  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:46):**  would easily rise to the top. And you ask why is that? And oh, well, it holds more moisture.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  Well, they measured the water holding capacity of each soil, the ability of the soil to hold  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:03):**  the grams of water per kilogram of soil, you know, took a core of each and put it in the  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  lab, measured the water holding capacity, and they were virtually identical. Well, wait  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:17):**  a minute, interest, you know, I thought the ability of soil to hold water would improve  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  with no till and it did, but it was extremely slight. You say so where's all the extra water  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:30):**  coming from? Increased root depth. Because of that pore space, you get this increase  
**[0:39:37-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  in pore space and soil structure and the plant roots could just go that much deeper and when  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  they measured water extraction by foot, that's where the extra yield was being made. Greater  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  rooting depth because of the greater porosity and better gas exchange in the soil. I think  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  this is a really important point. I have fresh in my mind the course that Harriet Mellow  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  has put together for Kind Harvest, which I've just been reviewing again this last week and  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  it just startlingly fresh perspective from a completely different perspective than we  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  often hear, even in the regenerative agriculture space. And she made the point that when you  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  compare everyone talks about organic matter and one of the significant benefits of organic  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:22):**  matter being additional water holding capacity. And she makes the point that when you do the  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  math and you compare the increased water holding capacity of organic matter compared to what  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  that soil should actually be able to hold on its own, it's actually not that significant  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  of an increase, which is exactly what you described. So, and when you look at it in  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  terms of percentage increases, it's actually not that significant. Five to 10% increases  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  in water holding capacity, but it increases the pore space and it increases the soil rooting  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  depth, which you pointed out, which is exactly right. You know, we measure water holding  
**[0:40:54-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  capacity a lot of times is volume of water per volume or per weight of soil. Well, one  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  thing that extra pore space does is it reduces the weight flux that reduces the weight. So  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:10):**  maybe we're measuring that the wrong way. You see the higher yields in a very arid environment  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:17):**  and that's obviously due to greater moisture availability. And when you take the same amount  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  of soil and you increase the volume, then your water holding per weight of soil may  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  not change, but your water holding per volume of soil and having simply more volume of soil,  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  like you know, that photo in the Moro plots, there's obviously more volume of soil on the  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  edge of that than there was in the tilled area. And that won't show up in water holding  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:50):**  per gram because the two soils don't weigh this thing. Right. What you're describing  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  is essentially a parallel of the challenges of measuring carbon in the soil profile. And  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  perhaps we should be measuring total water holding capacity in a four foot depth area,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:06):**  or we need to look at it in terms of volume rather than in terms of on a weight weight  
**[0:42:10-0:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  basis. You've had many different experiences and I really appreciate your writing style  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:17):**  in the books that you've written of being able to share stories of things that you've  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  observed. And with all of the different experiences that you have had, what is something that  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:26):**  you believe to be true about agriculture that is very different from the mainstream view  
**[0:42:31-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  or from the view of others in the ag community? I think we kind of alluded to it. I think  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  that we not sure quite how to word it, but that we've somehow hit some sort of ceiling  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:46):**  on what we can do in agriculture. People say, Oh, you know, we're never going to be able  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  to feed 10 billion people on the planet. I think that's a ridiculous statement because  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  our current state now is just so inefficient and I see wasted potential everywhere. I don't  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  see those limitations. I see opportunities everywhere. I drive down the road and, boy,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  if they just do this and this, there'd be so much more productivity off that acreage,  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  whether it's putting in a cover crop post harvest on a cornfield or interseeding or  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  aerial seeding or something they could run, you know, crop of cattle on here. I said,  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:27):**  gosh, if they just rotationally graze that pasture or, you know, not graze it into the  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:33):**  ground, leave enough canopy that's fully photosynthesizing throughout the growing season. I think the  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:40):**  thing is we have put such mental limitations on ourselves. I strongly agree with you. Just  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  the framework that you raised of thinking about not being able to feed 10 million people  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  in 20 years from now or whatever, 10 billion people rather. That is several people who  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  have had a podcast have made, have strongly refuted that statement, citing the large number  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  of food that is proportionate food that is wasted and so forth. Just as a mental thought  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  experiment, imagine what our agriculture would look differently if we and our food production  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:13):**  would be different if we just converted the 40% of corn acres that go to ethanol to actual  
**[0:44:20-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  food crops. What if we started growing tomatoes and potatoes and rice on those 40% corn acres?  
**[0:44:29-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  There would be zero problem growing a surplus of food. That is not going to be a problem.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  We just simply have to shift and change the types of crops that we're growing. It's not  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:40):**  that big a deal.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:41):**  Yeah. And I think another myth, and I have this recurring argument over and over, you  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  get into circles where people are very concerned about the environment and the future of the  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:56):**  planet. And I run in a lot of those circles, or I'm kind of an oddball because I'm a cattle  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  rancher and so people say, oh, you should be loved in those circles, but you're not  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  probably.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:09):**  I am dubiously accepted by some of those because they've had this idea drummed into their head  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  that cattle are somehow, we've had ruminant animals on this planet for millions and millions  
**[0:45:23-0:45:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  of years. And when you look at the digestive system of some of the dinosaurs had a fermenting  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:30):**  digestive system as well and belching methane and just like cattle do. And so we've had  
**[0:45:37-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  these animals, herbivorous animals with fermenting chambers in their digestive system for millions  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  and millions of years. And now all of a sudden they're changing the climate to the negative.  
**[0:45:52-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  It's absolutely ridiculous. And people say, well, if we just take all these pastures and  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  we just plow them up and grow spinach on them, we can feed the planet and we'd be so much  
**[0:46:07-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:07):**  better off. And to me, the absolute most biologically, ecologically friendly food production system  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:19):**  is well, maybe not a pasture, but maybe like a silvopasture, a two story agriculture that  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  incorporates large ruminant animals because of their ability to harvest high cellulose  
**[0:46:33-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  materials at the same time that those perennial herbaceous plants are sequestering carbon  
**[0:46:42-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  in the soil at an insane rate compared to our annual crop agriculture and produce a  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  very nutrient dense compound. And the idea when you look at our average pasture efficient,  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  you know, I talked about efficiency of corn. The management we give our pastures is so  
**[0:47:01-0:47:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:01):**  ridiculously low. You talk about a place we put mental limitations on ourselves. I mean,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:08):**  corn feels bad, but a pasture is 10 times worse. And I think their potential to produce  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:14):**  more food product from a pasture, that's where the real low hanging fruit in agriculture  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  is right there.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  A number of occasions I've spoken about CJ Fenzel's experimental work back in the late  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:27):**  70s. And I've written a blog post about it and republicized some reports of his original  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  work. But let's just summarize it very simply and say that he was producing 6,000 pounds  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  of meat, not beef, not live weight on the hoof, 6,000 pounds of meat per acre on intensively  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:45):**  managed pastures. What type of corn crop can do that? The answer is none. You cannot approach  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  that. And so again, if you go back to looking at protein production per acre, meat production  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:58):**  per acre, pastures and forages can absolutely win that. And you know, Dale, I completely  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  agree with you on misconceptions around herbivores. And it's such a ridiculous conversation. It's  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:08):**  not even worth you and I getting into that discussion at this point. But we could have  
**[0:48:13-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  a series of podcasts on that topic. Yeah, but it's not really worth it because my perspective  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  is it's simply that livestock producers are such a small percentage of the population  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  that they are convenient and easy to blame. And they're more convenient than giving credit  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  to the airlines where credit is really due. Yeah. I'm really interested in your perspective  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  on this question. Given your perspective that many of the challenges we faced are based  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  on the mental limitations that we impose on ourselves. Where do you see areas of opportunity  
**[0:48:47-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:47):**  for growers today? I think the biggest opportunity is self education. Look at you, you are probably  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  the best example I have ever met of a man who self educated and you probably have the  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  the learning equivalent of several PhDs. And you've done it yourself. The last class I  
**[0:49:11-0:49:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  taught, I told them that 20 years from now, if you think I'm the best teacher you ever  
**[0:49:19-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:19):**  had, then I have failed. Because if I really succeeded as a teacher, the best teacher you'll  
**[0:49:27-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  ever have is yourself. And nowhere in history have we had as much ability. I mean, unless  
**[0:49:37-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  you had a, you know, a cot set up in the library of Alexandria or the library that you know,  
**[0:49:45-0:49:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  there in Persia, not even then would you have had the opportunity to learn. I mean, what  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:53):**  we're doing right now, podcast, you can be getting a university quality education in  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  the cab of your tractor as you're going back and forth. And to me, the greatest opportunity  
**[0:50:06-0:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:06):**  we have in agriculture now is to cultivate our minds. And I love the podcast that you  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:14):**  do. I'm very visual learner. So I like, like when you do the videos and people present  
**[0:50:19-0:50:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:19):**  their PowerPoints. But the ability to, to obtain that education in your tractor cab  
**[0:50:26-0:50:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:26):**  while you're bailing hay or do another unnecessary tasks is just a  
**[0:50:34-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:34):**  dissing tractors Dale.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  The greatest tool we'll ever have is our own mind and the ability to sharpen that tool  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:46):**  right now. The audio, the visual that all this stuff is really, it's literally mind  
**[0:50:54-0:51:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:54):**  expanding. It's mind blowing. It is. And I love the things you do because you gathered  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:02):**  the minds, great minds and some of the people you have and the discussions you've had, you  
**[0:51:08-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:08):**  know, the James whites, those people that just, wow. And the ability to take advantage  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  of that as you know, normal farmer there in this tractor cab or going down the road, running  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  for parts or whatever you're doing, you have the ability to learn it and sharpen your mind.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  Thank you for the compliments, Dale. I agree with your perspective on the potential of  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:32):**  learning and education. And that that is perhaps one of the biggest untapped potentials. And  
**[0:51:37-0:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  I would say there is another that kind of parallels that. And I think what, what limits  
**[0:51:44-0:51:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:44):**  us from learning and from what limits us from expanding and considering new opportunities  
**[0:51:53-0:52:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:53):**  is often fear, fear of some type and every person's fears are different, but, and that  
**[0:52:00-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:00):**  they are often subconscious. You may not even be aware of them. It's really, fear is the  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  foundation of what keeps us from moving forward. And so addressing that, learning about that  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:10):**  and the personal development is, should include and incorporate that in addition to the intellectual  
**[0:52:15-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  learning. Just one comment that I'll make on the intellectual learning is I strongly  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:22):**  believe that we, that the collective we, society at large and the scientific community at large,  
**[0:52:29-0:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  we have all the knowledge and information that we need to develop a completely different  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:35):**  agriculture and a completely different approach to plant nutrition. This is one of the pieces  
**[0:52:40-0:52:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  that I'm so amazed by. We're working on a project right now to write a deep white paper  
**[0:52:47-0:52:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:47):**  on a specific disease that is a quote unquote incurable disease. And so we started pulling  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:53):**  together all of the literature and all the research on this specific disease that has  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:58):**  been published over the last 60 years in the scientific community. And you know, it is  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  absolutely, when you start doing that deep dive, it is incredible. All the information  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  is there over the last 60 years, they have identified exactly what amino acid profile  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  that this organism requires. They've identified the carbohydrate profile that it requires.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  They've identified the osmotic potential that it requires. They've identified whether it  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  needs an alkyl or acidic pH and what the redox environment is in the plant shoots where this  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  disease expresses itself. They've identified which enzyme cofactors are missing. Like when  
**[0:53:30-0:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:30):**  you put all the research papers together and you read them as one whole from the perspective  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:35):**  of looking at this from a nutrition management perspective, the information is all there.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:41):**  We've had it all along, but the mainstream perspective is not evaluating that information  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  through a lens of managing nutrition and managing immunity. Instead, they're looking at it from  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  the perspective of how can we develop a bactericide or a fungicide for this problem. It's incredible  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:00):**  to me that the knowledge of how to completely prevent this disease with nutrition management  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:06):**  is all there and has largely been there for 30 plus years. And no one is implementing  
**[0:54:12-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:12):**  it. It is considered to be an incurable disease that decimates orchards across the country  
**[0:54:15-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  every year. And yet, no one is really taking a different perspective on it. And so my point  
**[0:54:23-0:54:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  is out just to say that to your comments about self-education, sure, there are additional  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:28):**  pieces that would be interesting to know. We could conclude every research paper by  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  saying that there's more research that needs to be done, but we already know enough, in  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  my opinion, we already know enough to have a completely different approach to what we  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:42):**  do right now. So anyway, that's my soapbox.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:47):**  Well spoken. I have to agree. I mean, there's always more to know, but like put it into  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:54):**  farmer talk. I already know how to farm better than I do. And we do. I mean, the knowledge  
**[0:55:01-0:55:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:01):**  is there and it just behooves us to assemble all that knowledge into one entity and then  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:12):**  take action. We don't do a great job of that in agriculture.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  Yeah. So with this perspective of self-limiting beliefs that we have and the limitations that  
**[0:55:22-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:22):**  we impose on ourselves, if we were to remove those limitations and we were to fully invest  
**[0:55:31-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  everything and make all the changes that we know and farm as well as we know how with  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  what you have observed and the depth of experience that you have, what do you think the opportunity  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:43):**  looks like? What's the unrealized potential? In other words, what is the upside that farmers  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:48):**  would be able to achieve? You're really good at telling stories, which is one of the things  
**[0:55:52-0:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:52):**  I really appreciate about the books that you've written. Give us a story of what does the  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  opportunity actually look like? Oh my, that's a moving target because it's  
**[0:56:03-0:56:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  like plant geneticists. I remember reading that we have the corn plant has the potential.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:11):**  Back when the world record corn yield was like 300 bushel an acre, Herman Warsaw, I  
**[0:56:18-0:56:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:18):**  remember reading that plant geneticists said that corn has the potential to make 600 bushel  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:24):**  an acre under completely absolute perfect conditions. Everybody laughed. That'll never  
**[0:56:29-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:29):**  be done. Guess what? Here we are. World record is in excess and there's no such thing as  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  perfection in the natural system. He did not have perfect growing conditions for every  
**[0:56:43-0:56:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:43):**  single need of that plant and we're there. We've exceeded it. I'm kind of a pasture guy.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:49):**  That's my passion. I had this Eastern Gamma grass, alfalfa, polyculture and subsurface  
**[0:56:58-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:58):**  drip irrigation. In an area where our native grass pastures produce about 25 grazing days  
**[0:57:07-0:57:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  per acre, this pasture was producing over 300. Wow. It's 12 times the area average.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:16):**  Yeah, I said, oh, that's irrigated. It doesn't count. I actually stopped irrigating this  
**[0:57:22-0:57:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  field because I never saw, never detected water stress after the first few years. It  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:30):**  just wasn't there. I stopped the irrigation. I only had irrigation for two months out of  
**[0:57:35-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:35):**  the year. All the irrigation got watered, got diverted to the grain crops I grew. The  
**[0:57:42-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  pastures didn't need it at all. I look back and it's like, all I can think of is all the  
**[0:57:48-0:57:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  wasted potential I had in that system. I was 12 times the area average and I could still  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:55):**  see, oh gosh, I really messed up there. I messed up there. I take all my mistakes and  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:00):**  all the things I did wrong. How much better could it have been? I don't have a good answer  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  to your question because I don't think we have any concept until we start looking at  
**[0:58:12-0:58:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:12):**  all those ecosystem functions and the sunlight taking a look at every photon that hits bare  
**[0:58:19-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:19):**  soil is wasted forever. You can't get it back until we start looking at those things. Biologically  
**[0:58:25-0:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  derived nitrogen, I think is, we look at our sunlight capture, we look at our water capture,  
**[0:58:32-0:58:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:32):**  and then we start looking at the nitrogen that sits above every acre of land. What percentage  
**[0:58:40-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:40):**  of the nitrogen needs of our crop do we capture biologically from the atmosphere? Oh my gosh,  
**[0:58:48-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:48):**  that's ridiculously low in agriculture. And it could be 100%? Yeah. So you start looking  
**[0:58:57-0:59:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  at those things and gosh, I have no idea what that limitation is. You start talking about  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:07):**  the things that I don't know that I'll ever fully understand or even partially understand  
**[0:59:13-0:59:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:13):**  about subatomic physics of plants. Whoa, we're really getting in the weeds here. You were  
**[0:59:24-0:59:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:24):**  talking about the guy with the tomatoes that was getting him to harvest in just ridiculously  
**[0:59:31-0:59:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:31):**  short amount of time by manipulating the subatomic physics on plants. I actually took a subatomic  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:39):**  physics class in college. I didn't do well in it, but the things you're talking about  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:45):**  are just blowing my mind. I had no idea where that potential lies. It's so far out there.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:51):**  It's over the horizon for me. Can't even begin to predict that. This reminds me of a conversation  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:58):**  I had recently with Steven Beerlink here on the podcast as well. He's an apple grower  
**[1:00:02-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  from Washington. He was describing his own struggle with knowing where the goalposts  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  should be because historically they used to manage their crop for 50 bins of apple production  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  per acre. So they knew based on that number exactly how many spurs to prune to leave on  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  a tree and how many apples to leave on a tree and how to manage the nutrition accordingly  
**[1:00:26-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:26):**  and all the nuance that goes with that. Well then he starts working with AEA and the first  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  two years he gets a hundred bins an acre instead of 50. So now he's having to change his pruning  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:38):**  management. He's having to change the number of fruit that he leaves on a tree and there's  
**[1:00:42-1:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  all these. Now he's having to adjust nutrition to correspond to that. And then the next year  
**[1:00:48-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:48):**  comes along and it's in 150 bins an acre. And so the way that he described his personal  
**[1:00:54-1:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  challenge is he said, I don't know where the goalposts are anymore. I don't know what the  
**[1:00:58-1:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:58):**  goals are anymore. I'm having to figure that out as I go along. And so that's an expression  
**[1:01:01-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:01):**  of what you're talking about. Yeah, I just know it's way out there. It really is. And  
**[1:01:07-1:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  we start paying attention to some of these things. We know it's always going to be moving.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:14):**  It's a journey, not a destination. Because as soon as you put a number out there, you've  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  kept your potential. I'll never see it in my lifetime. Maybe in yours, you're younger  
**[1:01:25-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:25):**  than I am. Well, I think the conclusion of this conversation we've been having is that  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  as we develop a better understanding, and as we work more closely aligned with the natural  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  ecosystems and allow themselves to express themselves fully, then there will be an ever  
**[1:01:47-1:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  moving target, an ever increasing target. I think the better we develop ecosystems,  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:52):**  the better we manage them, then the more productive potential, there will always be upside untapped  
**[1:01:57-1:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  potential because we don't live in a perfect environment. And as we look at epigenetic  
**[1:02:02-1:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:02):**  improvements and overall ecosystem improvements on the microbial level, on the plant health  
**[1:02:07-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:07):**  level, it's just going to constantly keep expanding. I don't think we'll ever quite  
**[1:02:10-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  arrive. It'll always be a journey. But if we want to think about arriving, we could  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  always go back to CJ Fenzel in 1978 and 6,000 pounds of meat per acre. I'm looking forward  
**[1:02:21-1:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:21):**  to the day when someone who's grazing beef says, I want to irrigate my pastures and I  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:26):**  want to manage nutrition intensively and manage the grazing intensively and I want to see  
**[1:02:30-1:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:30):**  if we can replicate that because they did it 50 years ago and 40 years ago. And there's  
**[1:02:36-1:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  no reason why we shouldn't be able to replicate that today.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:39):**  Absolutely. Dale, what is something you wish all farmers knew?  
**[1:02:45-1:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  One would be how to think like a scientist. Instead of when they try something and it  
**[1:02:52-1:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:52):**  doesn't work to their expectations, it's just, well, that doesn't work around here.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:58):**  That's just ridiculous statement in my opinion. I think first thing is understanding how,  
**[1:03:07-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:07):**  well, I guess the second thing was how does soil function? Most farmers have no idea how  
**[1:03:14-1:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  soil actually functions. Figure out why something doesn't work. It's like when your car breaks  
**[1:03:20-1:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:20):**  down alongside the road, we don't just say, well, I guess cars don't work around here.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:29):**  You check the gas gauge or the tires all aired up. You find out why. And farmers are very  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:38):**  good at figuring out what's wrong with a piece of machinery, but they're not very good at  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  figuring out what's wrong with the practice. We're very mechanically creative, but it doesn't  
**[1:03:49-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  seem like we're very biologically creative. We look at machinery to solve our solutions.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  If I tried cover cropping and it caused a yield reduction in the next crop, well, that  
**[1:04:05-1:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:05):**  didn't work and we give up. Well, let's look at what we want recipes. Just tell me what  
**[1:04:14-1:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:14):**  to plant and I'll go do it. No, what are your goals and why will this cover crop? I can  
**[1:04:23-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:23):**  take a rye cover crop and plant it in front of soybeans and get a really nice yield increase  
**[1:04:30-1:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  in the soybeans. Well, where did it come from? Well, it could have come from reduction in  
**[1:04:35-1:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:35):**  weed competition. It could have come from greater moisture conservation. It could have  
**[1:04:42-1:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:42):**  come from greater CO2 evolution during the bloom period of the soybeans. There's a number  
**[1:04:48-1:04:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:48):**  of factors that caused that. It's not magic. There are growth factors that that rye cover  
**[1:04:54-1:05:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:54):**  crop was able to supply. And I could take that same rye cover crop and put it in front  
**[1:05:00-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:00):**  of corn and get a yield reduction. Well, I guess that just doesn't work around here.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:08):**  No, it worked great in front of the soybeans. What happened in front of the corn? Well,  
**[1:05:13-1:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:13):**  maybe it was nitrogen sequestration. Maybe it harbored some army cutworms or something  
**[1:05:19-1:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:19):**  that clipped the corn off or figure out why. I think if I could recommend farmers do anything  
**[1:05:26-1:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:26):**  said figure out why things happen instead of just noticing what happened, analyze it,  
**[1:05:36-1:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:36):**  be like announcers, the guys on football broadcasts that analyze everything ad nauseum and just  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:44):**  ruin the game. Instead of just learning the final score, figure out what happened. That  
**[1:05:50-1:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  would be something I'd like farmers to do. That's a great perspective, Dale. You've written,  
**[1:05:58-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:58):**  I think you have two books that are published now if I'm not mistaken, and you have a third  
**[1:06:01-1:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  one coming out. I've really appreciated the perspectives that you have shared in those  
**[1:06:06-1:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:06):**  books. What was the intention or the thought process behind putting those books together  
**[1:06:11-1:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:11):**  and putting them out there? I was hoping to get rich. I'm sorry. I'm sure you've been  
**[1:06:19-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:19):**  disillusioned. You're not going to get rich writing a book about agriculture. I mean,  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  that's just my now ex-wife. She said, why don't you just title this thing 50 Shades  
**[1:06:30-1:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:30):**  of Dirt and maybe people will buy it by accident. That's a great idea, but my publisher shot  
**[1:06:41-1:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:41):**  it down. Dale, if I publish a book titled 50 Shades of Soil, you'll know where I got  
**[1:06:45-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:45):**  the idea. When I was teaching, I had all these wild ideas that were kind of radical at the  
**[1:06:56-1:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  time. My students just sit there and said, one of my students, Chad Buckley, I still  
**[1:07:05-1:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:05):**  remember him sitting there, says, why don't you just put all these harebrained ideas in  
**[1:07:09-1:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:09):**  a book? That's kind of where the seed first got started. The summer of 2012, just devastating  
**[1:07:19-1:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:19):**  drought. My area actually was lucky enough that we caught a couple of really big rains  
**[1:07:27-1:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:27):**  during that summer. Even given those big rains, but we got a couple of three inch rains that  
**[1:07:35-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:35):**  came very hard. There were people side by side, five wire barbed wire fence between  
**[1:07:44-1:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:44):**  them and nothing else. There was 150 bushel dry land corn on one side and dead corn on  
**[1:07:52-1:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:52):**  the other. On the same exact rainfall, same exact soil type. How come? You sure there  
**[1:08:01-1:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:01):**  wasn't a difference in rainfall across that barbed wire fence? It sometimes happens to  
**[1:08:05-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:05):**  you. Well, that's what I was told, but I refuse to believe it. It's amazing rain just stopped  
**[1:08:12-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  right here. Dangest thing you ever saw. Difference in practices make a huge difference in outcome.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  It took that summer to really hammer home how much difference there was when conditions  
**[1:08:26-1:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:26):**  get really severe. That's kind of what inspired me to write the Drought Resilient Farm. Then  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:35):**  my publisher asked, well, what else are you passionate about? I said, pasture. They said,  
**[1:08:40-1:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  well, write about that. So I did. I really enjoy that. I look back at those books and  
**[1:08:49-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:49):**  I think, oh gosh, there's so many mistakes in these books. Not so much mistakes, but  
**[1:08:57-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  things I've learned about since. I'd love to be able to update them from when I wrote  
**[1:09:03-1:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:03):**  them because I've learned so much since then and mostly from other farmers and ranchers  
**[1:09:10-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:10):**  that said, oh, I wish I'd been able to put this little bit of information in there, this  
**[1:09:16-1:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  one. That's the problem with a book. Actually, the book that's coming out this fall was the  
**[1:09:22-1:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:22):**  first one I ever wrote, but I couldn't get a publisher to pick it up. Then when they  
**[1:09:29-1:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:29):**  did say, well, it's time for your soil book to come out, I blew the dust off the manuscripts  
**[1:09:36-1:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:36):**  and said, oh no, this will never do. There's so much more that needs added to this because  
**[1:09:41-1:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:41):**  I've learned so much more. If I actually waited to write the book until I knew enough to write  
**[1:09:48-1:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  the book, it would never come out. It's always going to be incomplete. It's always going  
**[1:09:52-1:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:52):**  to be insufficient. If you wait until it is, you'll never write a book. You got to stop  
**[1:10:00-1:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:00):**  somewhere and just get enough.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:03):**  Yeah. I know as you're describing, there's always lots of things that don't make it into  
**[1:10:08-1:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  the book because either we don't know them yet or because there's just simply not enough  
**[1:10:13-1:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:13):**  room for everything that we do know that we would like to include. It doesn't all fit.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:18):**  Is there anything that you would like to write about or to talk about, but you haven't, you've  
**[1:10:24-1:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  been cautious because you were concerned about the reception. You were concerned that people  
**[1:10:28-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:28):**  were not ready to hear it yet.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  I have been somewhat reluctant to talk about climate change. It's a very hot button politically.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  I can't claim to say I know climate change is occurring. I can't claim to have proof  
**[1:10:48-1:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:48):**  that it is or that it is not. Climate change has always, well, I think climate change has  
**[1:10:53-1:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:53):**  always occurred and is occurring. I think the bigger question is how fast is it occurring  
**[1:11:00-1:11:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:00):**  and are humans the cause of that? I think that's where the controversy lies. We all  
**[1:11:06-1:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:06):**  know the climate is changing because climate has always changed. The question is how fast,  
**[1:11:13-1:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:13):**  what direction are we heading and are we causing it? Then I think finally, can we stop it?  
**[1:11:22-1:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:22):**  Then I guess another question is should we stop it? We should be able to think about  
**[1:11:29-1:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:29):**  potential climate change objectively and scientifically. Someone asked me, he said, why are people  
**[1:11:36-1:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:36):**  farmers, why don't farmers believe in climate change? I said, I think if you talk to them  
**[1:11:42-1:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:42):**  one on one, pretty much all of them do believe in climate change. What they don't believe  
**[1:11:49-1:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:49):**  in, I guess the idea that they don't believe in the solutions that are being proposed to  
**[1:11:57-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:57):**  combat climate change. I think that's where the opposition lies. It's not in the belief  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  that the climate is changing. I think that's well accepted. It's the ridiculousness of  
**[1:12:10-1:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  some of the solutions that are being proposed. Like getting rid of ruminant animals. It's  
**[1:12:16-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:16):**  like, oh, it's the farting cows that are causing climate change. We need to eliminate beef  
**[1:12:23-1:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  from our diet, which is one of the most ridiculous statements. Anybody who truly understands  
**[1:12:28-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:28):**  how ecosystems work, and I don't claim to be the world's foremost authority, but I do  
**[1:12:34-1:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  have a basic understanding of the carbon cycle. And ruminant animals are not the problem.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:40):**  In fact, they may very well be the solution if it is indeed a problem. It's the opposition  
**[1:12:46-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:46):**  to the solutions that cause reluctance.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  I think in large part, at least from my perception and my perspective, some of that reluctance  
**[1:12:57-1:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:57):**  also comes from the historical pattern of agriculture being, I don't know if I want  
**[1:13:07-1:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:07):**  to use the word scapegoated, but agriculture is often credited with being the cause or  
**[1:13:13-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:13):**  being the fault of different challenges, such as environmental pollution, groundwater pollution,  
**[1:13:19-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  etc, etc. I certainly believe that there is an element of truth there. I don't want to  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  discount that entirely. There is an element of truth there. But why is it that only farmers  
**[1:13:31-1:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  are being held accountable for those different factors? If nitrate pollution and groundwater  
**[1:13:37-1:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:37):**  in Iowa is such a big deal, what responsibility do fertilizer manufacturers have for that?  
**[1:13:42-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:42):**  If any? It comes back, I made the comment earlier that it's a lot more convenient to  
**[1:13:47-1:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  blame the cows and the farmers than it is to blame airlines because it impacts a lot  
**[1:13:51-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:51):**  fewer people, and it's a minority of the population. How much of that holds true for other challenges  
**[1:13:58-1:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  as well? It's a convenient scapegoat group. Not entirely blameless, but still, my perception  
**[1:14:06-1:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:06):**  is that there is an element within the agriculture community that people are very cautious about  
**[1:14:13-1:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:13):**  immediately being blamed for things that they believe and they feel, not always entirely  
**[1:14:19-1:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:19):**  true, but they feel they have limited control over because many farmers feel that they're  
**[1:14:24-1:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:24):**  doing the best they can. While you and I may have a different perspective on that, they're  
**[1:14:30-1:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:30):**  doing the best that they know how at the moment, but I believe there's lots of room for different  
**[1:14:35-1:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:35):**  types of management practices and so forth. But still, they feel stuck, they feel trapped.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:41):**  And so being given credit for causing additional problems is not something they find particularly  
**[1:14:47-1:14:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  appetizing. The flip side of that, though, being blamed for climate change or whatever,  
**[1:14:54-1:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:54):**  is the other side of that coin is that if we are the cause of these problems, we are  
**[1:15:01-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:01):**  also the solution to those problems. And perhaps we should be compensated to be the solution  
**[1:15:06-1:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:06):**  for those problems. I think there's an increasing awareness that farmers, our farm fields, if  
**[1:15:15-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:15):**  indeed carbon dioxide, if indeed we are causing climate change, and if indeed carbon dioxide  
**[1:15:23-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  in the atmosphere or even water vapor in the atmosphere, like Walter Yenny and some others  
**[1:15:29-1:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:29):**  are starting to tell us, all those solutions can be created within our fields. And that  
**[1:15:38-1:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:38):**  may potentially be an income stream in the future that we look at. Maybe we will be compensated  
**[1:15:44-1:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:44):**  for that at some point. And I think it behooves us to arm ourselves with knowledge on how  
**[1:15:51-1:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:51):**  to do those things on our fields.  
**[1:15:55-1:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:55):**  Agriculture in the near future is likely to look significantly different from what it  
**[1:15:59-1:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:59):**  has for the last 70 years, because we have to recognize that there's different adjectives  
**[1:16:05-1:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:05):**  you can use. You can call it industrial agriculture, conventional, mainstream, whatever descriptor  
**[1:16:10-1:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:10):**  you desire. But it's important for us to recognize that it is relatively recent in human history.  
**[1:16:16-1:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:16):**  It's really only been since the green revolution, which is now what, 70 years old or something  
**[1:16:19-1:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:19):**  like that. We are seeing a lot of the unintended secondary and tertiary negative consequences  
**[1:16:27-1:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:27):**  of that. And it's reasonable to anticipate that agriculture in 20 or 30 years from now  
**[1:16:33-1:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:33):**  is going to be dramatically different from what it is today. We need to be prepared for  
**[1:16:38-1:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:38):**  that. This comes back to the comment that you made about self-education. If we want  
**[1:16:42-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:42):**  to be around for that time period and have a significant impact, then we should be preparing  
**[1:16:47-1:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:47):**  for that.  
**[1:16:48-1:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:48):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[1:16:49-1:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:16:49):**  Dale, I've really enjoyed this conversation. Thank you very much for being here and for

**[1:17:07-1:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:17:07):**  And what is the timing of when that will be available?  
**[1:17:10-1:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:17:10):**  That will be available this fall. Right now, the target date is October, October 21.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Dale_Strickler_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:17:16):**  Okay, wonderful.

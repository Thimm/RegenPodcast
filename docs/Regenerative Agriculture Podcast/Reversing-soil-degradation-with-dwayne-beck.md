### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 20:51:07)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast where we talk about the  
**[0:00:05-0:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:10):**  health and public health.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:12):**  My guest for this episode is Duane Beck, a name that I'm sure many of you know and for  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:18):**  those of you who don't know, you certainly deserve to know his name.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  I'm very honored to have you join us today.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  Duane, thank you for being here.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  Well, thanks for having me.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  You conducted a lot of research.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:29):**  You were one of the pioneers of innovating no-till agriculture on the high plains in  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  the North Dakota region.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  For our listeners who haven't heard of your history and background, can you tell us a  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  little bit about your history and what brought you here?  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  Well, I'm just a good farm boy.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  I went to college because that was better than the alternatives at the time.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  I was the youngest son, so you don't get to have the farm as the youngest son.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  But I went to college and got a degree in chemistry because I didn't really know what  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  I wanted to do.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  I didn't realize you could do science and agriculture.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Taught chemistry in a high school at Gettysburg, South Dakota for three years and serendipitously  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:16):**  met some people who got me back into graduate school at South Dakota State University working  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  on a PhD degree in soil fertility at that time.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  Most of that work was with the irrigator people.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:33):**  In that process of doing my work out there again around Gettysburg and Pierre and along  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  the Missouri River, the irrigators were having fits with runoff.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  This is the late 70s.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  They spent a lot of money because Earl Butts told them to farm fence row to fence row and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:51):**  produce everything they could.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  They spent a lot of money putting in irrigators to pump out of the main stem reservoirs on  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  the Missouri River and then proceeded to run the water right back to the reservoir.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  That's when we started to look at ways of making water go into the soil better.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:12):**  In that transition from when I was doing my PhD work until I became a real person, we  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  had some projects that started with O'Darrell, DeBoer, and people like that from Ag Engineering  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  on looking at low pressure sprinklers and stopping water runoff under them, which was  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  even worse than under high pressure.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  Lo and behold, we through this research, we figured out that if we didn't till the soil,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  the water went in better.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  That wasn't common knowledge at that period of time.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  But the second question then was, okay, if you don't do tillage, then how do you control  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  all these other things if you don't have a whole suite of tools that basically we didn't  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  have then that we do have now?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:04):**  We started looking at trying to do no-till, a little bit reduced till, and then full low  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  disturbance no-till.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  Using some of this technique that I probably learned from my grandfather and my father  
**[0:03:17-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  in terms of how you manage pests and diseases and weeds and insects through crop rotations  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  and cultural practices and those kinds of things.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  When I finished my PhD, the university hired me to manage the research farm at Redfield,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  South Dakota, which was designed to be the place that the water from the Wahi Dam was  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  supposed to go in a big canal to do gravity irrigation, flood irrigation type techniques  
**[0:03:50-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  on the Lake Dakota Plain, which is a glacial lake bottom similar to the Red River Valley.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  They put me managing that place because in this period of time, the local farmers, the  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  irrigators that we were working with in terms of stopping runoff from their irrigators,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  had started an organization with the goal of having a research farm more out toward  
**[0:04:19-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  the Missouri River to address irrigation problems because the station that was at Redfield,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  that project didn't look like it was ever going to be built and it never was, which  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  was a good thing.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  That the water, if they were going to use it, would be done more out here.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  The reason for that disconnect is when they designed the dams and whatever, that was in  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  the 30s and 40s, nobody had invented the center pivot.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  So, you couldn't irrigate the soils in this area because they were rolling land and you  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:54):**  can't do gravity irrigation on that.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  You need something perfectly flat.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:59):**  That's kind of how it started.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  Once we started running the Redfield farm, they got the money together and the organization  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:08):**  together to start this farmer-owned facility out along the river.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  Redfield farm shut down and we came here.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  I think it was a mistake to shut that one down, but it was a good thing to come here.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  I've been here since.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  We just done a lot of work in looking at dry land crop rotations, predominantly.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  By the time we'd come here, we'd realize that the irrigation thing was going to work okay,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  but the lifts were so high that the cost associated with pumping water is limiting.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  So, it was going to be a limited amount of irrigation here and saving the water, making  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  water go into the soil was actually a real big deal for the dry land guys here.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  We did a lot of work on dry land crop rotations and a lot of work on fertilizer placement  
**[0:06:06-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  and equipment development like the little spiky closing wheels that everybody uses.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  The May West version of that, which is one of the first ones, was put together here.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  The idea of putting a vertical wheel and a trench to push the seed in the bottom of the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  trench on a corn planter, we were kind of one of the first people to do that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  So, some of our ideas you saw come out through Xapta, some through other people.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  We never tried to really patent those.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  We were just trying to get them to the farmers.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:42):**  So, we let everybody do whatever they needed to with them.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  I think we've touched on a lot of pieces quickly that I'd like to dig into a bit more deeply.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  But the first one that comes to mind is we still live in a world today where there is  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  a lot of irrigation across the Midwest with center pivots and we see the water levels  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  in the Ogallala aquifer continuing to decline.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  We still have lots of irrigation happening in desert regions in Arizona and New Mexico  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  and California.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  And water infiltration continues to be a significant issue.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:19):**  I can't describe how many pivots I have walked into.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  That's behind the pivot.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  The water is running away from the pivot rather than infiltrating into the soil.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:28):**  I think there are still many people who aren't aware of the work that you have done historically.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:33):**  And I'd like to just open it up by asking the question, how much can water infiltration  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  be improved by not tilling and by managing the soil differently?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:44):**  What really is possible and what's the pathway to getting there?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  Well, it's a bit soil dependent, but we have some very challenging soils here.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  And we can put on, our normal practice at the Cone Lakes is we have them designed to  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  match the worst case scenario for farmers in this area.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  So, they will put on 1.2 gallons per minute per foot, which is equivalent to the very  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  outside end of a standard center pivot, quarter section center pivot, putting on 900 gallons  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  of water a minute.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  And that's where the water goes on the fastest.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:24):**  So, we do that all the way across our machines, or three of our machines that are lateral  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  moves.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  And that's the reason.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:31):**  That's the reason we're using lateral moves so we can have that high intensity everywhere.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:36):**  And we run these very low pressure sprinklers on them, which means we put on two inches  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  of water in nine minutes when we come across the irrigate in the summertime.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:48):**  And one of the, yeah, it's pretty fast.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  And one of the things we do that is the most effective thing is if we have people visiting  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  in the summer, we will just always, the guys know that when we have a group.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:04):**  They know we're going to have show and tell.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  So, even if we don't need to be irrigating, we'll turn something on just to show off and  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  we'll have a machine running that fast.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  We'll throw a pan down so they can see how fast the pan fills up.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  And then we walk them behind the machine and they will not get their feet muddy, which  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  will totally drive them crazy.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  And it's so dramatic that then the argument is pretty much over in terms of, okay, I can't  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  do that in my place or whatever.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:38):**  Now the soils we have here, probably two-thirds of the ones we irrigate, are true verticels.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  There's these really heavy clay soils that developed in an ocean bottom.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:50):**  And so there's 75 to 80 percent Montmorel and many clays.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  The other day I was going through some stuff and I looked at the soils analysis of one  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  of our experts at SDSU when we looked at this site.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  And he had made the statement that the northern part of the farm we would never be able to  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:09):**  irrigate because we couldn't get good enough infiltration.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  Well, we can get that on these soils.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  And then we have these lust-dry soils, which would be similar to northwest Iowa or something  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  where they tend to seal up really easily.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:22):**  And it has the same kind of soils because all the particles are the same size.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  And so if you hit them with a raindrop they'll seal up.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:29):**  And we get that kind of infiltration on them as well.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  So it doesn't really make any difference to us.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  But the important part is we get that same infiltration on the dry land.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:39):**  And so when we do get a big rain the water goes in the soil instead of running off.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  And with irrigation you can, if you've got enough money and if you have enough time you  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  can pump more water maybe.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  But on dry land you don't get a second shot at it.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  So but you're right.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  They have a huge problem.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:00):**  And I've worked with people in different areas and this whole idea of somebody doing intensive  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  tillage in the area where they're pumping the aquifer dry, whether it be in California  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:13):**  or in Oklahoma or Texas or whatever, is just insane.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  And I'm not sure that we can expect to be allowed to continue to do things like that  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:24):**  in the future without somebody calling us on it.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  You know it's not a responsible thing to do because that water resource belongs to lots  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  of people even though I may have a water right which whatever.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:39):**  But it's you know one of the things we do at the farm here which is somewhat related  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  is the farm is owned by a group of farmers.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  So I work with 11 member board of directors that represent 500 and some farmers that have  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  these long term goals.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  And so we try to look further down the road as far as you know 100 years, 50 years, 100  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  years, 600 years.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  If I continue to do what I'm doing now what's it going to look like here?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  In South Dakota you know our statehood is 1889.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:14):**  So there wasn't much here before 1889.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:18):**  Lewis and Clark came through in 1804 and we've degraded the ecosystem pretty dramatically  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:23):**  in the US in 200 years.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  It's not just infiltration, it's just that's the right thing to do in the long run is to  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:31):**  degrade the soil.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:33):**  There are several issues that you raised that are worth addressing.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  There's the soil degradation and think about in your comments about continuing to pump  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  water out of the aquifers.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  Just in the short term it's a question of do we have permission to continue doing this  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  kind of social societal permission to continue doing this.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  But if you go a bit longer term a single generation or less it will no longer be a question of  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:58):**  permission it will only be a question of if we keep doing this there will be no water  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  left in the aquifer.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:04):**  Yeah no it'll be gone that's right.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  And then what's your plan B?  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  You know we don't have a plan B and it's not just the US.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  Argentina's got some real challenges with what they're doing right now.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  I have a slide that I use in my presentations that I say that ecosystem and soil degradation  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  is not a problem.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  It's the symptom.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:30):**  And the problem is greed and hubris and inattention.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  There's a whole list of things that indifference and whatever.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  I mean tillage is one of the tools that we do but it's not the problem either.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:48):**  The problem is all these societal things of foreign policies and whatever but the short  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  term thinking and thinking that we're smarter than the ecosystem so we can if we damage  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:02):**  something then we can turn around and add something and it's better.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  And I don't think that that's true.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:08):**  You know if we're not mimicking the natural ecosystem processes we have issues.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:15):**  I think the piece that I'm really intrigued with what you described is when you have two  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:21):**  inches of infiltration capability in nine minutes.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  Actually I do have to play angels advocate for just a moment here.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  If they don't get their boots muddy is that because the soil is covered with crop residue  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:34):**  and never had soil contact in the first place?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  Well yeah it's covered but the big difference is macro pore flow.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  So it's more similar to your lawn.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:46):**  I mean you could put two inches of water on your lawn and walk out there and you never  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:51):**  get mud either.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  It's because the soil particles are in a structure so the structure there that supports you.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  And then the macro pores these big holes formed by worms and termites and roots and whatever.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  When the water falls on the soil and it is cushioned a bit by the residue that's there  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  it will go down that hole.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  And when it goes down that hole it will find the dry spot in the soil and soak in from  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  the side.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  So what you've done is magnified your infiltration area by several orders of magnitude.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  That's a real secret to a lot of things that we do is the macro pore flow.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  And it took me a while to figure that out because it doesn't happen overnight.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:43):**  But when you do tillage then everything has to go through the matrix in between each of  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:48):**  the little particles.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  And every time it hits a discontinuity it stops.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  Like if you have clay over silt someplace in there or if you have a plow pan or whatever  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:01):**  that's more of a discontinuity.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  And when that water gets there it has to stop and saturate some areas and then it can start  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:09):**  to flow into the next layer.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  Have you ever measured your maximum infiltration rate on the heavy clay soil, the vertices  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  that you would expand?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  Well we have an experiment with phosphorus because we've done a lot of things with phosphorus  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  because we don't want our phosphorus to go to the lakes.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:27):**  And that's maybe a whole other conversation.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:29):**  But we've been trying to do an infiltration thing on fields where we've got these phosphorus  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:35):**  treatments.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  This spring my guy put on over 20 inches of water in an hour before he got some water  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:45):**  to run.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:46):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  You're going to go like okay.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  Well what I'm really intrigued by is for the last couple of decades the conversation around  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  water has really revolved around water infiltration.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  And we've forgotten or we haven't often discussed that there's more to that story.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:09):**  There's also percolation.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  You can infiltrate two inches in nine minutes but what happens if you filled up the upper  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:14):**  layers and you can't percolate downward?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  And then the third aspect is does that soil have the capacity to lift that water back  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:23):**  up and deliver it to the crop?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:25):**  Water delivery and water infiltration are sometimes two very different things.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  I think we haven't appreciated that enough.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:31):**  So when you have the capacity to absorb 20 inches of water in an hour, I would imagine  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  that also means you have a really incredible capacity to deliver water to the crop throughout  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  a growing season.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:45):**  That's how you do and on the soil that he was on those are some of our better soils  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  in terms of water holding capacity.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:51):**  On the heavy clays we have shale at four feet.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:57):**  So that water doesn't go below that.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  It will perch a water table on top of it which eventually will go sideways.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  So that it's not a good thing to do that necessarily.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  What we wanted to look at with this thing is what happens to phosphorus when it doesn't  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  run off and now it's going down those macropores maybe and how much is sticking to the soil  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  and then how much gets down to the bottom and if I had drain tile how much would go  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:26):**  out of the drain tile which it does do now.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  People have figured that out.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  So how much of it can we stick?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  The real secret to the whole thing is the fact that the macropore allows you to fill  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  the soil in the areas where it's dry.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:42):**  Once it runs off or depurculates you don't have it, you can't get it back anymore necessarily.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  So then can you fill the soil if your surface is wet can you put water down below and fill  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:56):**  that zone below which used to be when guys did summer fallow and whatever that could  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  be very hard to do that.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  The way we figured that out was the time we spent at Redfield where we have the lacustrine  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:13):**  soils, the lake bottom soils because the lake bottom soils if you take a probe out there  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  and look at them it looks like Oreos when you get down a ways.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  Lacustrine means a glacial lake.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  It was a lake during glacial times 17-20,000 years ago.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  Then in the spring when you'd get melting you'd have this melt water come in which was  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  pretty heavily laden with silt.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  The sand part of that would settle out first and form a layer.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  Then the silt part would form a layer.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  Then the clay part would form a layer.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  The next spring you'd have the same thing happen.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:53):**  That happened for 1000-2000 years during that period of time.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:57):**  So you have these layers in that soil.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  If you try to get the water to flow through that soil on its own you have to saturate  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  the clay before the water moves into the silt.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:09):**  You have to saturate the silt before the water moves into the sand.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  So you're saturating each of these little layers independently as you're going down.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  It's just awful how slow the water goes in the soil.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:25):**  But as soon as you have macro pores then you get this thing we talk about.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:28):**  Even though we don't have the lacustrine soils here we had the same thing happen in the James  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  River Valley when we started.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  It just floored us that that would happen.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  The ag engineers and everybody just all scratched their heads and me included.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  But that's the way nature would have worked.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  If you go into a native prairie or whatever you just have tons of those macro pores.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  You can go into a native prairie and put two inches of water on it and it doesn't run off  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  either unless it's been overgrazed and capped and whatever.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  It's how that was managed.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:03):**  When you were describing this process you mentioned a graze that caught my ear which  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  is summer fallowing.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  Now I've observed a few instances in southwest Kansas and in eastern Washington and parts  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  of Montana that I've become persuaded that the idea of summer fallowing is a really crazy  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  idea.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  But I'm not from those areas.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  And so when I tell people that they think I'm a few bricks short of a load.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  So I'd love to hear your perspective on summer fallowing.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  What have you observed?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  You're one of those eastern guys.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  This area where Dakota Lakes is was predominantly wheat and summer fallow in the 1970s when  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:46):**  we kind of entered the picture here.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  With pretty intensive tillage and they were doing winter wheat.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  And they were saying it was to conserve moisture.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:58):**  And what it really does is allows them to mine the nitrogen a bit faster.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  Because if you were in the old days where you really didn't have the fertilizers and  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:09):**  whatever and you were going to grow a crop out here you had all this organic matter that  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  built up by the native prairies over the years.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  If you tilled it for six, seven times between growing crops you had more nitrogen available  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  than if you just tried to continuously crop because you've decayed more of the organic  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  matter.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  And you didn't necessarily have the moisture at that time if you're also using tillage  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  to grow legumes like you could further east where you could put the meadows or whatever  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  in for a while.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  And if you're doing tillage you really couldn't do that well.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  And so it was really a way of doing a better job of mining the nutrients from the soil.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  And I just, again I have one of these slides I use that sometimes gets rocks thrown at  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:00):**  me but I just say that tillage is the agriculture what fracking is to petroleum.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  In that it speeds the ability to extract nutrients from the substrate and leaves the substrate  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:16):**  degraded.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  And if you're mining that's really what you want to do anyway.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  The more you can get out of there the better but if you flip your thinking to long term  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:26):**  thinking to short term thinking then it doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:31):**  But this was short term stuff.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  We came here, you know, you'd break it, you'd farm it and then eventually you'd move on.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  I mean that way and it's not dissimilar from slash and burn agriculture in the tropics.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:50):**  The idea of the burning is to try to speed that release of the nutrients.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  But again we haven't done this for very long and we've already started to degrade things  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  pretty quickly.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  And the eastern areas, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, somewhat  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  famous farmers, were discussing soil degradation in the late 1700s.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  They sent letters back and forth to each other and said if we don't stop this degradation  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  of the soils in the eastern seaboard we'll have to move west to find better soils again.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  And we didn't repeat the process there.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:34):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  And then in 1804 they bought the Louisiana Purchase.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:39):**  I mean, hello.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:42):**  But you go to France, I mean the reason that the Europeans came here is because they degraded  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  the ecosystem so bad in Europe they had to go somewhere else.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  And they came here and they came to Australia and they came to South America.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  And those places are pretty well mined out.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  It's really a long-term, it's really the long-term thinking thing that is messed up.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  And you know, I'll give a plug to a book if it's okay with you.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  Darren Quallman has written a book called Civilization Critical where he talks about  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  this idea of linear systems where we're extracting stuff versus cyclic systems, which is what  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:29):**  nature is, is more cyclic.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  And he does a really good job of describing this stuff.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  And you know, we've been thinking that way, but we're not as eloquent as he is in terms  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  of discussing it.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:43):**  But that's really what needs to happen.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:45):**  I mean the idea of mining the nutrients from the North American continent to send them  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  initially to Europe, beaver and buffalo robes and whatever.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  But now the soybeans and the corn and the wheat and now to China.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  And we're doing that probably at the cost of degrading our ecosystem and probably below  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:09):**  the cost of production.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  So I don't know who gets value from that.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:14):**  I mean I think that's one of the things if you start looking long-term you kind of start  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  scratching your head.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  Saying, why are we doing this?  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  I think there's lots of things in our society that we're scratching our heads about.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  But I want to come back to summer fallowing.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:32):**  You can describe summer fallowing as essentially a process allowing us to better extract nutrients,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  particularly nitrogen and others from the soil profile.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  Not so much water conservation, which makes sense to me because when you're using, particularly  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  using tillage for summer fallow, of course many people today are using glyphosate, but  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:52):**  if you're using tillage, of course you're losing a lot of moisture through evaporation  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  as well.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  So the question that I want to ask in a nutshell is, is summer fallowing and biennial production  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:06):**  necessary for moisture management or can you grow a crop every year?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  Yeah, well what we did here, like I said, this area here, and you can go quite a ways  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  west of here, used to be all wheat and summer fallow.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  And now the guys here grow a crop every year.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:26):**  And we're probably on the eastern edge of the summer fallow hotspot.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  So let's say that we have a little bit more moisture than a guy in Montana or something  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:36):**  like that, or Alberta.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:38):**  But we now grow a crop every year and at least half of those crops, most of the farmers here  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  that are good no-tillers and whatever, half of their crops are high water use crops like  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  corn and sunflower and sorghum and those kinds.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:54):**  So they've been very successful.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:55):**  No-catch is a big part of that, having good surface residue is part of that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:01):**  As you go further west, I still think it's possible.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  And I have written things on diversity and intensity.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:12):**  And as you get further west, your ability to grow, let's say the corn thing or depending  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  on your soils, becomes more challenging.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:25):**  But you can still grow crops every year, but maybe you're going to grow a forage crop instead  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  of a grain crop at times.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  And a lot of that depends on your soil.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:34):**  So the carte blanche, summer fallow thing, in most cases I'd say I can never see situations  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:42):**  where full season fallows make any sense.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  Now when you add glyphosate to a full season summer fallow thing, you really make your  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:52):**  salinity problems and stuff much worse because now instead of the water running off, it goes  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  into the soil and it depurculates and the soil doesn't hold that much water.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:03):**  So you've made the salinity problem come forward.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  We see this even in the corn valve or in more humid areas where when they started doing  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  no-till, the salinity gets worse because the water now is going into the soil instead of  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:18):**  running off.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  And that means their rotational intensity, what they're doing in terms of using water  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  isn't matching the water that goes in.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  And it comes down to those natural cycles.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  So if you're not mimicking the water cycle, you're making it go in the ground but you're  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  not using it, which mother nature, if it goes in the soil, she'll use it.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  If you're not doing that, then you start creating some problems.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  But yeah, summer fallow kind of went away and we use the Dakota Lakes Research Farm  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  and the Redfield Farm.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  The main area they influenced initially was the central sector in the state of South Dakota.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:03):**  So that's covered by the South Dakota is a pretty big state but it's not like a Texas  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  or whatever.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  It's like in Nebraska.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  So it's the middle third, let's say, of the state.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  And so we did an exercise a few years ago where we looked at the productivity of this  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  area in 1986 initially.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:24):**  And that was before we really had gotten started and it was before glyphosate and all that  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  stuff.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:30):**  Before glyphosate was cheap.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  But it had a rainfall characteristic similar to 2014.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  And so we took 1986 and compared that area to 1986 and 2014.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:43):**  And then we looked at how much grain they produced those two years and what that grain  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  was worth the night before we were going to present this to the Board of Regents.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  And the difference in productivity or the profitability or whatever you want to call  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  it, total production, was $1.6 billion with a B. It was huge.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  And all you have to do is come here and drive up and down Highway 83 and you see grain bins  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:12):**  and you see new houses.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:15):**  But you also see small communities that now are starting to revitalize.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:21):**  So they got to the point where they thought the schools were going to have to close.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  And some of the schools did close.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  And now we have schools again and we have elementary, two sections of elementary kids  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  in the schools where they almost closed the school.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:37):**  And we have processing plants, pre-processing and ethanol plants and those kind of things.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:43):**  So that's a big win.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  That's a significant change in changing local communities like that.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  When you export everything, when you export everything, the nutrients and whatever, just  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:57):**  export the grain, you don't need the people.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  And we've got mechanization in terms of how we farm now that you don't need the people  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:04):**  to do the kind of work that we used to do by hand, picking corn by hand, for instance.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  I pick as much corn in two minutes as my dad picked in a whole day.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  It's like, zoom.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  And so we don't need the labor to do the farming.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  So what are we going to do with them?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  And if we export all that stuff and don't take it higher on the food chain, then the  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:32):**  people leave too.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  In Argentina, they're leaving the country.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  Here they leave the countryside and go to the cities.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:41):**  But in Argentina, physically a lot of them leave the country and go to the US or go to  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  Europe or something.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:48):**  And there's economic issues involved there as well.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:51):**  You mentioned a concept that I'm guessing many people are not familiar with, the idea  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  of deep percolation and using the water that you add.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:01):**  Can you describe what is happening and what is going on?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  Well, it happens everywhere, which is interesting.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:10):**  But you got to look at the native vegetation and what does it do with water.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:15):**  Your country, you had these tall grasses or you had trees or something like that that  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  had these massive root systems that go very deep.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  And so they would grow and extract the water from a great depth during the hot part of  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  the year and they'd put moisture into the atmosphere and all this stuff.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  When you started to do tillage and grow only annual crops, the water doesn't get extracted  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  from those depths.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:41):**  And so now you're farming in the corn belt, you're farming the top three feet pretty much  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  because your roots really don't go much deeper than that.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  Now if I take a good soil that holds two inches of water per foot, that's only six inches  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  of total water.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:58):**  So what happens is as soon as you get any appreciable rainfall, you're too wet.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  And so then we have to have the drain tile, which means that water leaves, but it takes  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  a bunch of things with it that shouldn't go.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  And then when you get a dry period, you only have six inches of reservoir.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:18):**  So you're working with a little tiny bucket.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  Whereas if you had mixed in the system like they used to do until not very long ago where  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  they had perennial species in the system, you would suck the soil dry at times all the  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  way down to maybe six, eight feet.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  So now when you got a wet year, that bottom portion of the soil was empty that you don't  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  use for annual crops.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  So when you transition from that perennial back to an annual, that bottom part was dry.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  But that's no big deal because you don't use it anyway for that annual crop, but it's a  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  place for that water to go when you get a big rainfall then.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:02):**  So I don't think...  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  Again, it gives you a lot more resilience.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:04):**  And it gives you a lot more resilience and you build organic matter during that period  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  of time so your bucket now holds two and a half inches per foot.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  I mean, there's a whole bunch of pieces to that puzzle, but we're just not using it very  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  well.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:20):**  When you go to Australia, for instance, where the rainfall comes in the wintertime, they  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  don't get a lot of rainfall necessarily, but it all comes in the wintertime.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  And their soils hold very little water, probably an inch per foot, something like that.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:37):**  So they constantly, as soon as they take their big trees, if they have the big trees in there,  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  the trees will bring the nutrients up and then the nutrients fall off of the tree and  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  they end up back on the surface.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:52):**  And so they cycle their nutrients and keep the saline seeps away.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  As soon as they clear that land and start farming it, they form saline seeps everywhere  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  and the water table rises and there's a whole bunch of bad things that happen to them there.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  But they haven't mimicked what the natural ecosystem was doing.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  And I don't know that I have all the answers to all those things, but you know where the  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  problem lies.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  Putting in a perennial sequence will probably be necessary for the long term if we're going  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:20):**  to do it.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  Now putting in alfalfa and selling the hay is not the right answer because you're taking  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  all the nutrients and shipping them away.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:31):**  So that's not the right answer, right?  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  But it does do the thing you need to do by extracting the water from down there, but  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:40):**  it's selling all the nutrients.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  Yeah, we need perennials that we can cycle the nutrients locally within the system as  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:46):**  you do so.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  Yeah, and that means cows, it means livestock.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  Right.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:51):**  So it means something different than what we're doing.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  I mean there's trees that grow that are legumes and the leaves that drop off are very high  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  in nitrogen.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  And there's places where they use that in a corn production system to provide the nitrogen  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:06):**  for the corn.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  They grow the corn between the trees.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  And during the warm weather, the trees get rid of their leaves during warm weather, not  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:15):**  cool weather.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  So it's a different ecosystem than we have in the US, I think, but it's an interesting  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  concept can use these perennials somehow in concert with the crops we need to grow for.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  If we're growing corn to take it to a feedlot to feed cows, maybe we should just move the  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  cows out to the field.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:38):**  Many innumerable ecosystem benefits to moving the cows to the field.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  And so when we think about nutrient cycling, you spoke earlier about your historical research  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  with fertilizer placement and some of the recent research you're doing with evaluating  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  how phosphorus moves in the ecosystem.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  I'm actually reminded of a quote, I believe it's originally attributed to William Albrecht,  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:03):**  where he said, the art of fertilizer placement is about figuring out how to place the fertilizer  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  so the roots can dodge it.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:13):**  And I always got a bang out of that because it's really a description of fertilizers of  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  that day and even still today having a high salt index and temporarily when in present  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  in high concentration challenge to the root systems and to biology.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  So I'd love to learn more about what you have learned with your research.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:34):**  And what do you see as the future of fertility management and nutrition management?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:39):**  Well, when it comes to phosphorus, my PhD is in fertility.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  So I always say it's easy.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:46):**  You just have to have available nutrient in an area where there's active roots and adequate  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  water and then the plant figures it all out after that.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  So now the devil in the detail is what do I mean by active roots and what's available  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  quote unquote nutrients and those kind of things.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  And when it comes specifically to phosphorus, there's a lot of phosphorus in our soils,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:15):**  but it's not quote unquote available to a normal plant, especially in tilled systems  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  because you don't have the mycorrhizal fungi populations and things there.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  But if you start no tilling and you're not doing disturbance and you're not killing the  
**[0:39:33-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  mycorrhizal fungi webs that you have out there, then you have these massive root systems because  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  your plant makes an association with the mycorrhizae and that mycorrhizae helps it get phosphorus  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:49):**  and a bunch of the cations like zinc and whatever out of the soil.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:56):**  So what we're doing is really changing the equation and not that the guys that did soil  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  fertility research and calibrated soil tests were wrong, but they calibrated things like  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:09):**  the Olson, the Bray, and Malick phosphorus tests for tilled systems to serve the needs  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:17):**  of plants that had no mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:20):**  And the way I explain the mycorrhizal fungi thing to people, they said, do you ever drive  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:24):**  through the mountains and see a tree growing out of a rock and wondering how the heck it  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  could do that?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  Well it can only do that if it has these mycorrhizal associations going on in there that help bring  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  all these nutrients in exchange for the carbon that it gets from the tree.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:47):**  Of course our irrigated ground is located right adjacent to the Missouri River, so we're  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  very cognizant of not moving phosphorus to the river.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  That's why we're doing this.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  And we can't continue to turn the lakes into east green or it would just not be a thing  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  we should do.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  And we can't defend that.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  We intentionally drew the soil phosphorus Olson, we use the Olson test here, down to  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  less than five parts per million on all of our irrigated ground.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  And then we took one field and we put strips in there where we built some of it back up,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  where we put on like over the last four or five years, three to 600 pounds of map to  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  build it back up some.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:32):**  We're not getting a yield response.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:35):**  And now we are placing some replacement phosphorus adjacent to the seed at planting time.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:45):**  So we're putting like 45 pounds of map out there.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:49):**  But we don't see a yield response and I said to a good friend of mine the other day, I  
**[0:41:54-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:54):**  said it's just amazing to me that we can have five parts per million less soils with 50  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  pounds of map.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  And I was combining a field of irrigated corn that was running 260, which in the east isn't  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  that great of corn, but it's pretty good corn for us.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:13):**  How does it do that?  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  Well, I have about 6,000 or 7,000 pounds of total phosphorus to four feet.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  So it's there.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:20):**  It just isn't soluble.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  And if it isn't soluble, it's not going to go to the river.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  And that's what we're finding in our test because we're doing these things with the  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  runoff and whatever and it's not moving, first of all, because we're not moving the water.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  And second of all, if we can make the water move, there isn't a lot of phosphorus that  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:40):**  goes through it.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:41):**  This is something we've experienced as well in our work.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  We end up, based on soil and SAP analysis data, we end up significantly reducing nitrogen,  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  potassium, and phosphorus applications, usually to the point where nitrogen and potassium,  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:56):**  it's not uncommon for us to approach zero applications after a couple of years because  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  it is all being delivered from soil biology.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  And the same happens for phosphorus as well, depending on the native geology, of course,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  or some soils for which that isn't going to happen very easily.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:12):**  Yeah, there's no testing.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:14):**  There's some soils that are just inherently low in phosphorus.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  And we think the phosphorus thing, we can get really low and stay there, especially  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:24):**  now that we have livestock in the system because we're cycling.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:27):**  And one of the things I talk to farmers about is if I ship my soybeans to China or wherever,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  every unit train of soybeans that leaves has about 450,000 pounds of phosphate in it.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:42):**  That's not coming back.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  And whether it goes, maybe it only needs to go to North Carolina, it still isn't coming  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  back.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  Whereas if I grow soybeans, which we do, and sunflowers and some other things, and we press  
**[0:43:56-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  the oil from them on farm, which we do, and we feed the meal to our livestock, but we  
**[0:44:06-0:44:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  sell the oil, the only thing I've sold in the oil that goes away is sunlight, water,  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:13):**  and carbon dioxide.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  Whereas if I sell the bean or sell the meal, then the nutrients go away too.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  So it's a long-term goal thing.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:25):**  We do place nitrogen in proximity in our no-till stuff.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:31):**  We place nitrogen in proximity to the corn row when we plant.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  And that's the thing that is the most automatic for us to get a yield response.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:41):**  Because we're a little bit far north, so a lot of our cycling of nitrogen doesn't happen  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  early.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:47):**  It happens later in the years.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  We have to put nitrogen in that area close to the row to get the early growth that we  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  think we need for the high yields.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:57):**  Corn decides how big an area it can grow, and it's like B4 or B5.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  We haven't seen as much response to placing of the phosphorus.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:05):**  We just like to put it there because it's convenient.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:09):**  We don't see as much response to the phosphorus to placement.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  We do within wheat, but we don't in soybeans and corn.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:16):**  But we consistently see a response in corn to soybean and sulfur and nitrogen placed  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:22):**  in proximity to the row.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  And I think that's because nitrogen moves to the root with water.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:31):**  The root doesn't necessarily move to the nitrogen, and there's not very much water use early  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  in the year.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  And so, if you just broadcast it out there or whatever, it has trouble getting enough.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  When you did lots of tillage, you had a lot more nitrogen sitting there, but why would  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  you want it there at that period of time?  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  And so, if we can get the plant going early, then the nitrogen becomes available later.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:56):**  I don't think we have our soils here.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  They were pretty badly degraded, quite to the point where they're self-sufficient on  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  end because we are selling products yet too.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:04):**  So, we do sell wheat and some of those things.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:08):**  As you have changed your cultural management practices on tillage and agronomy management,  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  what have you observed with pest management?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:18):**  You described that you adapted some historical practices for managing pests with proper patients  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  and cultural management.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  What have you observed and what are you doing?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  Well, wheat disease and insects are mother nature's way of adding diversity to the system  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:31):**  that lacks diversity.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  So, let's start with that.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:35):**  We haven't used an insecticide here.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:38):**  This was the 18th year where we haven't sprayed an insecticide out there for anything.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:44):**  We have a massive population of predators, but if I started using, I'm very concerned  
**[0:46:51-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:51):**  because there are times when I do get seed that I buy that has some neonic on it or something,  
**[0:46:59-0:47:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  which we don't like, but you can't always avoid it.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:02):**  We get concerned about that because we want to protect our predators.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  So, if we put a blank application on something, we just whack the predators big time.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  Weeds, it was one of the things that worried me immensely when we started.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:16):**  I'm not afraid of weeds right now, but crop rotation is a big part of that.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:23):**  Low disturbance is a big part of that because there's a population of weed seeds at depth  
**[0:47:29-0:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  here that came before me that if I did tillage, those would all have a shot again.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:36):**  So, if I leave the sleeping dog to fly and I use very low disturbance techniques, the  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  vertical tillage and all those things that people are doing is a good way of planting  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  weeds.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  We have data on all this stuff.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  It is very dramatic about what we can do with controlling weeds with crop rotation in combination  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:59):**  with low disturbance.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:01):**  If you have a weed like, I'll take the evil weed of the year, Palmer Amaranth.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  If you have a couple of years in there of cereal grain in a row, it just wipes them  
**[0:48:13-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  out.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  They don't have a chance because by the time the Palmer starts to grow, the wheat has got  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:18):**  full canopy.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:19):**  Some of the stuff that we're doing in the higher rainfall areas that people are doing  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  with cover crops and things, that's another part of that thing.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  So, I always in the beginning, and I still say it if I think about it, but the thing  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  that we use for weed control or maybe pest control in general, but weed control is competition,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  sanitation, and rotation.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  So I try to keep weeds from getting into the field.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  I try to keep weeds that are there from going to seed.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:51):**  So we control the weed seed bank.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  Part of that's done with rotation.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  So you've got sanitation, you've got the rotation.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  So if you've got Palmer, you rotate into something like winter wheat that's highly competitive.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  It's all interrelated, of course.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:06):**  In competition, what we want to do is to keep the weed at bay until my plants can get big  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  enough to compete in.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  And that's all part of that thought process, and they all work together.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  And herbicides are part of that to a certain extent in that we use them to make sure weed  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  doesn't go to seed or we use them to inhibit a weed long enough for my crop to get big  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  enough to compete.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  And I'd like to see us have some other non-chemical weed control methods.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  I mean, I thought of doing things like the liquid nitrogen to freeze things.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  I don't know, whatever.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  But tillage just isn't an option, because once you do tillage, you can't control an  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  ecosystem if you do tillage.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:51):**  I mean, tillage is just the non-starter.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  There's no such thing as a little bit of tillage.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:57):**  And we've piddled with all that.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  I've done the vertical tillage.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:00):**  I've done the whatever over the years.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:03):**  Triptil, we've done some of that.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  And it just has too many negatives, because you just throw everything out of whack.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:11):**  We're not all that concerned.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:12):**  Now, if we have this movement going on that's trying to say that we can do no till and organic,  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:21):**  I haven't really seen that defined well.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:26):**  And they start calling – we've had the term regenerative for years.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  It's been on our sign for at least 20 years.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  But that's not well defined now either, because everybody seems to grab ahold of it.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  But then, what does it mean?  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:45):**  And so, I have some concerns about some of those trends we're starting right now.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:50):**  I mean, our definition of regenerative is that we're matching natural water nutrient  
**[0:50:57-0:51:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:50:57):**  cycles, capturing sunlight comparable to natural systems.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:02):**  I don't think you can do that if you're doing tillage.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  I know the other day I think I had somebody from NPR that was talking to me or emailed  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  me or whatever, and I said the problem with organic systems is not what they're intending  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  to do.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:17):**  And what they're intending to do and what we're intending to do is exactly the same.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  We want to produce healthy food in a manner that doesn't screw up the ecosystem.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  And so, now we're down to how do you do that.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  And organic systems are based on tradition.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  They're not really based on science.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:41):**  They're based on tradition.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  And traditional farming systems tended to fail after about 500 years.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  Agrarian societies, read David Montgomery's stuff, I mean traditional farming systems  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:54):**  tend to fail fairly quickly.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  Now, if you had enough land area, you could come in and do a destructive system for 10  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  or 15 or 20 years and then move on and let the rainforest come back.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  But I don't think we have the land to do that anymore.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  So we tended to think we need to do something better than that.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:17):**  We want to base it on science, but we still want to do those concepts of where we have  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:23):**  healthy food and then we protect the ecosystem.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  And that entails mimicking those natural cycles.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  If you don't mimic the natural cycle, you screw it up to the point where you have to  
**[0:52:33-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:33):**  put in artificial methods of trying to control water, whatever, then you have some issues.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  This raises an important question.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:43):**  Obviously, you have had incredible experience.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:48):**  You've been a very outspoken advocate of the need to not till your soils.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  You've been able to very clearly communicate the challenges that occur when you do till.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:00):**  We haven't really gotten into this so much in this conversation, perhaps a little bit,  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:03):**  but it's certainly something you have described and many other people have described very  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  well.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:07):**  Now, that raises a challenge for growers who are growing potatoes and carrots and sugar  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  beets.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  I always say, well, then sugar beets, just, you know, because everybody should quit eating  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:21):**  sugar anyway, you know, but...  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:23):**  I agree with you on that one.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  But you know, I think those are engineering problems.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  I think you could pull a sugar beet out of the ground without doing tillage.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  It's just an engineering issue.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  It's just easier to do it if you plow them out of the ground.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:42):**  But I think the Germans are working on one where they grab it and vibrate it out of the  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  ground.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  And I don't know that that would be a problem.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:53:52):**  Potatoes, my mother, who was of Dutch ancestry, grew her potatoes under a bed of straw.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:00):**  So we never dug potatoes.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:02):**  We just ruffled them out of the straw pile.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:06):**  And there are some people looking at doing that.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:09):**  You know, so I always say that that's a... these are engineering problems, not necessarily  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:14):**  agronomic problems.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  So I just kind of skirt off to the edge of those.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  It's my job as an interviewer, though, Dwayne, to hold your feet to the fire a little bit.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  So you haven't given me an answer for carrots yet on a scale of 50 acres at a time.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  Well, whatever.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  I no-till my carrots in my garden.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  We no-till our garden.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  We can pull them fine, but you have to vibrate them a little bit.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:39):**  But I don't think carrots are quite as hard.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  You know, I don't think you have to disrupt the whole area to get them to come out.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:46):**  Now, they are loosening the ground.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  The last one I saw like two days ago, they were running a little wavy cola alongside  
**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:54):**  the row and pulling them out by the tops.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  I also think that I would personally believe that that is also not just an engineering  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  problem in the case of speaking to carrots specifically, but also perhaps a genetics  
**[0:55:07-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  problem that we can actually grow a crop with a strong enough top to easily pull it out.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  No, and I think you're right.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  I think we need to do that.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:15):**  And then that means realizing that, just like with tillage, if you just said tillage is  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:20):**  not an option, and then you start looking at alternatives.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  In our case, that was a bit of the deal because if we did tillage, we had runoff.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  But also, the research farm at Redfield had no equipment.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  I mean, I had a 706 and 3 bottom plow when I went there.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:39):**  So if you're going to try to be a real farmer and pretend you're a real farmer, we weren't  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:45):**  going to make it if we tried to use conventional methods because we didn't have the equipment  
**[0:55:50-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:50):**  and we didn't have the money to buy it.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  So we bypassed it and went right basically to no till, a little ridge till in the beginning  
**[0:55:58-0:55:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:58):**  and then no till.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:55:59):**  And didn't need the equipment.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  It was a necessity thing.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  An analogy to that is the first time we went to Australia, we barely had cell phones in  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:08):**  this part of the world.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:10):**  It did.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:11):**  They had big bag phones that you had to stick up on top of the car on top of the hill to  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:16):**  talk to anybody.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  And they had them all over Australia, but they didn't have their landlines.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:22):**  It just wasn't efficient for them to try to build landlines all the way into the outback,  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  but pretty easy to put in some cell towers.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:31):**  And that's a similar analogy.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  If we just didn't have the incentives to do tillage, we wouldn't do them.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  We would not do it.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:39):**  The government makes our tractors cheap because we can write off the money we spend on them.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:45):**  And nitrogen cheap and fuel prices cheap.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  And corn prices cheap.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:49):**  And they give us subsidies.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:51):**  I give my job.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:53):**  Pretty excited.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  Duane, I think you and your organization are perhaps unique in agriculture in taking the  
**[0:57:03-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  long-term view and asking the question of what will our ecosystems look like if we continue  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  to manage them as we are now in 600 years from now?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:14):**  With that perspective, what do you see happening in the future?  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:18):**  And what do you see as the changes that need to be brought about in agriculture in the  
**[0:57:22-0:57:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  future?  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  Well, I don't know what we're going to see in the future.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:27):**  I don't know how we get government, society, and business to take a long-term view.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  I think they used to have a longer-term view, and they do now.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  And right now, it's about a 50-minute thing.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:43):**  Government is, you know, what's the stock market doing today, you know, type thing.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  But government specifically is only looking at the next election cycle.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:53):**  And I don't know where you get the maturity of a person to show up there and discuss this  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  long-term stuff.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:01):**  But it has to be, I think, it has to be farmers for one, because if they want to stay in farming,  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  they want their kids to be in farming, and they want their grandkids to be in farming,  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  then we need to start thinking like that.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  And you know, you mentioned our organization briefly, but it's a group of farmers, and  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:24):**  the people on the board are farmers.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  And it's not an advisory board.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  They're owners.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:30):**  They have to pay money to join.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  It's not a lot of money, but they're owners, and they're treated like owners.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  But we have on our board right now a person that's the great-grandson of one of the guys  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  I worked with in the beginning.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:46):**  Just a grandson, a great-grandson.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:50):**  And I worked with him and his dad or his son, who is this kid's grandpa.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  So that's what we're talking about.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:58:59):**  We strive very hard to get these young guys, young people, involved in the system, because  
**[0:59:07-0:59:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:07):**  they're going to be the future.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:09):**  And what do I see in the future?  
**[0:59:11-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:11):**  I think we've got to take the long-term approach, and I think we need to sell our products to  
**[0:59:16-0:59:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  the consumer.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:18):**  A hundred years ago, 120 years ago, 100 years ago, sometimes less than that, everybody bought  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  their food from somebody they knew.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  Either they knew the farmer or they knew the butcher or they knew whatever, but they knew  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  that person and they trusted that person.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:39):**  And we need to reestablish that trust, and I think the next generation will be able to  
**[0:59:46-0:59:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  do that using the power of the internet and social media and whatever.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:53):**  So instead of coming to see me, you'll have a virtual tour of what we do.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:59:59):**  And by the way, we did have a virtual tour this year that posted, so it's quite interesting.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  They did a good job.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:08):**  We've had several hours of video up showing what we've done.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  So we can do that, and we can say, what's important to you?  
**[1:00:16-1:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:16):**  And this is how we're doing this.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:19):**  We will do this for you.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  Whereas the big companies are trying to hop into this market, but they keep saying they  
**[1:00:27-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  want to do this.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  And boy, this is exactly what we want to do.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  But when push comes to shove, as soon as the guy that said he was really interested moves  
**[1:00:37-1:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  to a different position, the next guy isn't as interested.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:40):**  Or when they find out it's really difficult, because this isn't easy stuff.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  It's difficult.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:46):**  And I see that is our future, I think.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:51):**  And that makes us more cyclic.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:00:53):**  And I think maybe the pandemic thing is focused a bit more on this.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:00):**  You know, when people were running out of flour, you know, I just kind of grinned, you  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:05):**  know, I got flour.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  I got my own weed, I got my grinder, and I make my own flour, and I make bread out of  
**[1:01:12-1:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  it.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:13):**  Now, we haven't been making bread for anybody else, but we can do that.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:17):**  And we can make beef for somebody else.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  But we have to go back to figure out how we harvest that beef, which is what we're looking  
**[1:01:25-1:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:25):**  at now, is how you raise it, how you harvest it.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:29):**  You know, our beef never goes to a feedlot.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  It's out in the field.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:35):**  I know from Gabe Brown, but he said, you know, he had a really great life and one really  
**[1:01:39-1:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  bad day.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:40):**  I mean, it's a type of thing, but that's really the way it should be.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:45):**  So I see that as being the future, because that's where we're going to harvest the value.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:52):**  Right now, we're really, I've got a talk I give now, which I talk about doing, we're  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  doing a really good job of doing the wrong thing, instead of focusing on doing the right  
**[1:02:03-1:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:03):**  thing.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:04):**  And you know, maybe for quite a bit in the early career, we were teaching people how  
**[1:02:10-1:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:10):**  to do this, raise crops for export stuff way better.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:16):**  And they're making $1.6 billion more in this area, and they're all happy, and they got  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:21):**  their kids at home, and things are good, but we're still exporting all our nutrients.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:25):**  We're doing a really good job of doing the wrong thing.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:28):**  And the secret is to turn that now to a point where now we're doing a really good job of  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:34):**  doing the right thing, which is building these cyclic systems.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  What has to happen to bring that about?  
**[1:02:41-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:41):**  What has to happen to bring that about, to bring the right thing on the scale?  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  Well, Ralph Holdsworth from Gettysburg, who was one of our first real leaders in this  
**[1:02:51-1:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:51):**  and president for quite a while, he would always talk about it as a brain transplant,  
**[1:02:56-1:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:56):**  a different way of thinking about things.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:02:59):**  So what has to happen?  
**[1:03:00-1:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:00):**  I think we need to try to get a more level playing field.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:03):**  Right now, with the crop insurance, and not to say we don't need some insurance, but the  
**[1:03:08-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:08):**  crop insurance subsidies and the subsidy type things that are going on, and then agriculture  
**[1:03:14-1:03:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  gets involved in the politics, international politics thing, and it's a weapon, or it's  
**[1:03:22-1:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:22):**  not food, it's something else.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:24):**  And I think we need to go back and change our thinking, this brain transplant, and think  
**[1:03:28-1:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:28):**  about it.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:29):**  What we're doing is producing food.  
**[1:03:32-1:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:32):**  How do I produce that food?  
**[1:03:33-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:33):**  What am I producing it for?  
**[1:03:36-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  When you think about the brain transplant, we can begin, of course, by sharing ideas  
**[1:03:41-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:41):**  and information, which is why I started hosting this podcast.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  So that leads me to an important question.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:48):**  What is the one thing that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[1:03:51-1:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  Oh, that's a new...  
**[1:03:58-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:58):**  See people are really good at interviews.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  They go, that's a really good question while they're thinking of an answer.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:02):**  So that's what I'm doing right now.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:09):**  I wish they knew that mother nature bats last.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:16):**  So if you're not doing something that fits into her system, she wins.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  Buzz Clue, who you probably know, was interviewing me one day.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:28):**  And I said, I get a kick out of...  
**[1:04:31-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:31):**  At that time, several years ago, we had a lot of people at the university that their  
**[1:04:36-1:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  sole focus was on genetic manipulation stuff.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:43):**  And I said, we have all these gene jockeys down there, and they keep coming up with these  
**[1:04:46-1:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:46):**  new things and go, isn't this neat what I have here?  
**[1:04:50-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  And I said, mother nature's looking over their shoulder and going, oh, you damn amateur.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  You know, I've done this stuff for millions of years.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:01):**  Watch this.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  Zip.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:03):**  You know, and that's just the way it is.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:07):**  So when you're trying to not do...  
**[1:05:11-1:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:11):**  If you're trying to change the natural system, you're just never going to be successful long  
**[1:05:18-1:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  term.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:19):**  You know, the guys that came...  
**[1:05:21-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  I used Lewis and Clark.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  Lewis actually walked across the south part of our property in 1804, taking notes.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:30):**  So I know what was here.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:32):**  And between 1804 and statehood and in 1899, there wasn't a lot of things happening other  
**[1:05:39-1:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:39):**  than it killed the native animals, the buffalo or the bison and the beaver and whatever.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:46):**  The wolves, we just had a heyday in here and sent those off to Europe to make coats and  
**[1:05:51-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:51):**  hats and whatever.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  And then statehood happened and people start moving in and doing tillage and overgrazing  
**[1:06:00-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:00):**  and all these things.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  And in less than 50 years between statehood, basically when humans showed up and when we  
**[1:06:07-1:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  had the Dust Bowl, it was less than 50 years.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:12):**  The way this conversation has been framed so far is how things degraded when humans  
**[1:06:17-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:17):**  arrived.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:18):**  But that is approaching the conversation under the assumption that...  
**[1:06:22-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:22):**  No, European humans arrived, let's put it that way.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  European ancestry people arrived.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:27):**  I believe this ecosystem was a highly managed ecosystem, managed differently than we are  
**[1:06:33-1:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:33):**  managing it and producing different crops, of course, but still highly managed by a very  
**[1:06:37-1:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:37):**  evolved society.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:39):**  Lewis and Clark stopped in Bismarck, North Dakota and fought corn from the Navy.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  Bismarck.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:49):**  Wow.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  Which I gave a meeting in the very early 90s in Bismarck one day and a big meeting, a lot  
**[1:06:59-1:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:06:59):**  of people, 1500 people there or something.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:02):**  And I suggested that they should really be looking at growing corn in their rotations  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:06):**  because they were just growing spring wheat and summer fell.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:10):**  One of the scientists there jumped up and said, we can't grow corn in North Dakota.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  I just said, well, Lewis and Clark stopped and bought corn right here in Bismarck, 1804.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:22):**  We should have, the US government should be able to match that.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:28):**  I did not make a friend.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  We don't look at what we're doing from an ecosystem standpoint.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:36):**  I'm not sure some of what native culture did was wrong and they moved on too because we  
**[1:07:43-1:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:43):**  had the ability to do that.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:47):**  But they were limited, if you read the Dierin-Caulmouth book, they were limited by lack of transportation  
**[1:07:53-1:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:53):**  and that was a limiting factor.  
**[1:07:55-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:55):**  So they couldn't do the extractive thing because they didn't have the railroad.  
**[1:07:59-1:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  And there's all these things that we've done that help us do a better job of screwing things  
**[1:08:05-1:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:05):**  up that might just go away.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:08):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:09):**  Duane, there are so many more topics that I would love to get into and you have such  
**[1:08:14-1:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:14):**  a wealth of knowledge to share with people.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:17):**  Where can our listeners go to learn more?  
**[1:08:20-1:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:20):**  Well, our website, dakotalegs.com is one place.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:25):**  There's lots of stuff there that really shows a bunch of history and stuff.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  I suppose I'm going to have to write something, but we have a lot of really good practitioners  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:35):**  now in this area that are poking at it and like I said, that Quallman book is awfully  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  good to get you thinking about things differently.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:45):**  And that virtual field day that we have on there, we have done set rotations here on  
**[1:08:51-1:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:51):**  some areas for 30 years now.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:08:54):**  So we have a field that's been continuous corn for 30 years and a set of fields that  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  have been corn, soybeans and such.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:03):**  And then more diverse rotations and we have here dry land versions of this.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  And there are very significant differences in the soil.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:10):**  So that's what we did on that.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  Our part of the virtual field day is when I took a real high tech thing called a spade  
**[1:09:19-1:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:19):**  and looked at the soils.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:25):**  And I warned the lady, I said, you better have some really good video stuff that you  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:29):**  can show this because I can show this in person to people.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:32):**  And everybody can see it.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:35):**  But I don't know if you can do it on video.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  And she did a really good job of getting a crew in there that it shows up really well.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  So we were really impressed with what got done there.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:46):**  But it's frustrating in that we don't have really measures in science that if I send  
**[1:09:53-1:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  them those different soils that they could immediately give me numbers that show me how  
**[1:10:00-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:00):**  much different it was.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  I've got a graduate student working on it again, but it's really difficult that you  
**[1:10:06-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:06):**  can see it with your eyes.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  The first soil health group was based in Akron, Colorado in the early 90s.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:15):**  And they came here, these three guys, and they came here and we were looking at things  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:20):**  and they were trying to come up with this definition of what soil health is.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  And I took them to one of our fields where it had been native prairie, never been tilled  
**[1:10:30-1:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:30):**  as put that way.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:31):**  It was native prairie at one time and then it was kind of misused in terms of grazing  
**[1:10:37-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:37):**  and stuff, but it never had any tillage done.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  And we converted it to a no-till system without doing tillage.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:44):**  And I got them to that point and I took them out on that hillside and I handed them each  
**[1:10:49-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:49):**  piece of paper and I said, I want you to write me the definition of a beautiful woman, which  
**[1:10:54-1:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  I couldn't do now because that wouldn't be politically correct.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:10:57):**  But they're all guys, so that was a start.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:00):**  But anyway, and they looked at me like, what do you mean?  
**[1:11:04-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:04):**  And I said, well, come on, just write it down.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  What's it take to be a beautiful woman?  
**[1:11:08-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:08):**  We should be able to define this.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  And of course they can't do that.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:12):**  And I said, there's no way to do that.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  Write down the hair color and whatever, but we all know one when we see one.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  And then I took a spade and tipped up a little bit of that soil and I said, there you go.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  That's what it looks like.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:25):**  So, to figure out how to describe that is going to be very, very difficult because you  
**[1:11:31-1:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:31):**  lack that intrinsic thing to get with all your other senses versus just numbers.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:37):**  And I think that's really one of the keys to farming is to a large extent in art.  
**[1:11:46-1:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:46):**  There's science involved and you got to use science, but some of it's art to know if what  
**[1:11:50-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:50):**  you're doing is the right thing.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  And so, some of these really successful guys do a better job of using their senses, I think.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:11:59):**  There is still no replacement for the human senses of touch and smell.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:06):**  There is no scientific instrumentation yet that can replicate what we can sense.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:11):**  Yeah, that's one of the things I told them.  
**[1:12:13-1:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:13):**  I said, just figure out, because we held it and had it smell it, right?  
**[1:12:17-1:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  That's one of the things they do.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  Figure out how to document that smell and you'll be a ways down the road.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:26):**  That's one of the issues with precision ag is a great tool and it's that.  
**[1:12:33-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:33):**  It's a tool.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  And we actually still have in our position, I think, the first yield monitor that became  
**[1:12:41-1:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:41):**  a yield mapper.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:42):**  We had a guy at SDSU that was very creative and we put a cooler on the outside of the  
**[1:12:50-1:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:50):**  cab of a 4400 John Deere combine and put a computer in there and tied it into the Ag  
**[1:12:56-1:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:12:56):**  Leader yield monitor with RS-232 chip in and whatever and put up a GPS tower and did all  
**[1:13:02-1:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:02):**  this stuff, right?  
**[1:13:04-1:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:04):**  But the trouble with that is digital computers aren't real good at making decisions.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:11):**  And so we were having trouble making that connection between the digital computer and  
**[1:13:17-1:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:17):**  the analog computer that sits between people's ears.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:21):**  And the analog computer is very good at making decisions.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  The year I was born was the first year my father had a corn picker.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  Prior to that, he was picking corn by hand.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:36):**  And he had an intimate knowledge of every square inch of his property because when he  
**[1:13:40-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:40):**  picked the corn, he knew where he had the good areas and the bad areas and whatever.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  And what we need to do with precision ag is try to develop that intimate knowledge in  
**[1:13:50-1:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:50):**  the farmer using this way of doing a better job of measuring what's going on.  
**[1:13:57-1:13:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:57):**  And I think we'll get there.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:13:59):**  But precision ag is not a science and it's a tool.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  It supports the other sciences, I think.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:07):**  I think it's good at doing that.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:09):**  But in and of itself, I'm not sure it's necessarily a science.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:13):**  And the president of the college will call me tomorrow.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:15):**  Anyway.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:16):**  Duane, thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and wisdom so freely.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:24):**  And I look forward to actually meeting in person sometime soon and having further conversations  
**[1:14:31-1:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:31):**  with you in the future.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:33):**  Okay, me too.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  Enjoy your day.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:37):**  The team at AEA and I are dedicated to bringing this show to you because we believe that knowledge  
**[1:14:42-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:42):**  and information is the foundation of successful regenerative systems.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  At AEA, we believe that growing better quality food and making more money from your crops  
**[1:14:52-1:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:52):**  is possible.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:53):**  And since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers to help them do just  
**[1:14:58-1:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:58):**  that.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:14:59):**  At AEA, we don't guess.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:01):**  We test.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  We analyze.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:03):**  We provide recommendations based on scientific data, knowledge, and experience.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:08):**  We've developed products that are uniquely positioned to help growers make more money  
**[1:15:11-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:11):**  with regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:13):**  If you are a professional grower who believes in testing instead of guessing, someone who  
**[1:15:18-1:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:18):**  believes in a better, more regenerative way to grow, visit advancingecoag.com and contact  
**[1:15:24-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:24):**  us to see if AEA is right for you.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  Thank you for listening, and we look forward to working with you.

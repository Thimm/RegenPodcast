**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:14):**  This podcast has a lot of listeners from the land down under, but we haven't yet had a

**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  He is one of these wise elders of regenerative agriculture in the Australian landscape, has

**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  across Australia.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  So Terry, I'm very excited to have you here and to get you to share some of your wisdom

**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  I think there are many people in the regenerative agriculture space here in North America who  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  haven't heard your name, who are not familiar with your work.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  And so I'd love to begin this conversation by hearing more about your story.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Tell us about your pathway and what brought you here.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  You've been in agriculture for a number of decades and have a lot of wisdom to share.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:16):**  So what's the story that brought you here?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:18):**  Thank you, Jon.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  And thank you for having me on your podcast.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  I'm a great fan and there are many, many Australians now that are listening to your podcasts.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  Myself and my children and many of our staff now are really great fans of yours.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  So it's an honor to be on your podcast.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  I think I arrived at regenerative agriculture partly by accident, but partly by design.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  And I have been in the game now for five decades, but not necessarily.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  I think I spent my first two decades in conventional agriculture.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  When I was a young person, I had an unbelievable opportunity to work for an American company  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  on an Australian cattle station.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  And there was enormous problems and they were losing a lot of money.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  And my job description was I wanted somebody who knew something about growing grass.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  And I thought I knew something about growing grass.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  So anyway, I got a job and I found that all the management practices and science that  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  they'd been trying to implement on that particular property, and it was 800,000 acres and we  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  had 12,000 cows and four or five thousand horses and another four or five thousand buffalo.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:41):**  And that scale was new to me.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  But when I went for the interview, it was a three-day interview and they said, well,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  you've got the job.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:50):**  And I said, well, I don't want it.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:52):**  And they said, well, why not?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:56):**  I said, well, I don't know anything.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  You know, I've never worked in this environment.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  I don't know these trees.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  I don't know these plants.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:02):**  I don't know these soils.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:04):**  I've never worked on anything of this scale.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  I don't think I can help you.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  And they said something to me then that I have never forgotten.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:13):**  And they said, no, we want somebody who has no preconceived ideas.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  So on that basis, I took the job and I spent time looking at what was going wrong in the  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  business and particularly with the ecology.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  And there was a lot wrong.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  And at the end of six months, I said to them, just sell up and get out of here because what  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  you're trying to do is not working.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:37):**  And they said, well, we're not used to walking away from a problem.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  Tell us what we need to do.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  And I was 28 at the time and I said to them, well, give me, you know, a million bucks in  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  three years and I'll sort it out for you.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  So they said, well, you better do it.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  Well, I sat back in my heels and I thought, whoa, what hole have I just dug myself into  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  here?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  So I put together a research project to solve the problems that I'd seen when I was driving  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  around.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  And a funny thing happened.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  I put this project together and then my intuition started playing up.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  But my intuition kept saying to me, there's something wrong with this.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  And so I said to one of the guys I was working for, I said, look, there's something wrong  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  with what I've just put together to research.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  And he said, what is it?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  And I said, I don't know.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  But I said, I need to go and talk to more people.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  So what I did was I went back to my roots in and I used to work for the Queensland Department  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:37):**  of Primary Industries and had good connections with a lot of scientists in CSIRO.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  So I went back and met with a lot of those people and spent three to four weeks.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  And what happened was every time I explained my situation, I actually learnt more about  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  what it was.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  And it wasn't necessarily what people said to me, but it was me having to repeat my story.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  And every time I repeated it over about three to four weeks, it got clearer.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  So I flew back to the station after that and I said to Cliff, well, Cliff, we've got to  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  go 180 degrees away from what we've just decided on.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:18):**  And we sat down on our front lawn for two days and argued.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:22):**  And at the end of two days, I had him convinced that we needed to change 180 degrees.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:28):**  And the guys, a few executives were coming out from New York a week later to approve  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  the first R&D project I'd put together.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:36):**  So I sent them off at Tellex.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  So this is back in the 80s and said, you know, I've changed my mind.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  We need to do something completely different.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:45):**  So they came out and I gave them about a six page report on why we needed to do something  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  different.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  They came to the station, grabbed that report, went straight back to town and stayed there  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  for about three to four days.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:59):**  And we found out later they were trying to sack, get rid of Cliff and myself because  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  we'd lost it.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:05):**  And anyway, they couldn't replace us in three to four days.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:08):**  So they came down to have it out.

**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  And at the end of three days, I had them convinced that where I'd got to was right.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  It's an unbelievable thing to get these very senior executives with a lot of wisdom and  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  age behind them and a 28 year old kid basically saying that everything you've been doing for  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  the last 12 or 13 years is wrong.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  And so is all the science and let's start again.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  And I guess that was one of my real epiphanies.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  And I knew then that I didn't know anything.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:47):**  And so I had to work out everything from first principles.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  What was the conclusion that you came to?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  What was the pitch that you were presenting them that was so different from the mainstream?  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  Well in the Northern Territory it was in those days, the common form of production.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  It's very extensive and it was basically cattle hunting.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  So there was no fences and no infrastructure.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  And you would go out with a team of people and helicopters were just starting to come  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:15):**  in in those days.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  And you would go and find cattle and bring them in and anything that was big enough to  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:21):**  sell you would just put it on a truck.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  And if the price was okay, you'd send it off to the abattoir.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  And then you just let everything else go.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  And if the price was right next year, you'd come back and do the same again.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:32):**  So there was absolutely no control.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:34):**  There was no animal production.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  And the production in that system was very, very low.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  But so were the overheads.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  And what they had done was moved into what I would call middle ground.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  So the option was we're running basically a beast to 100 acres and we were getting 44%  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  calving, 15% mortality in cows.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  But in under that old system that was okay.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  You didn't measure any of those things and it was cheap to do.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  The alternative to that was go to a complete high input system where we develop pastures  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  where we could run a beast to two acres and get improved animal performance and total  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  control over the system.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  But where they were was in no man's land of sowing legumes into native pasture and putting  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  super phosphate on.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  I remember the first year I was there, they'd ordered a thousand tonnes of super phosphate.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  And one of my first jobs was to go out with aircraft and spread that super phosphate over  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  thousands and thousands of acres.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  And it was really a waste of time.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  So the basic that I got back to was said, well, we're throwing phosphorus on the ground  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:47):**  to try and get it to an animal.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:49):**  We're planting legumes to try and get protein to an animal.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  Why don't we just feed protein and phosphorus directly to the animals and then go and develop  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  replacement pastures at the high input end.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:02):**  And where that ended up was still had low animal performance, but had built higher overheads  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:09):**  into the business.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  So they're actually in no man's land.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  And so what I said was, we've got to go back to the two edges, get out of where you've  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:17):**  been and we have to develop the technology to feed animals and manage them extensively  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  and increase the reproduction rates and decrease the mortalities.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  And then we have to develop pasture systems that are more intensive from scratch.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  And that's what we did.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  So how did you approach regenerating, I suppose regeneration is not quite what you're describing  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  yet, but how did you approach implementing these changes on that type of scale?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  And then what happened a few years after?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  We did very extensive research and my breeder trial, my cow trial, for example, I had 1300  
**[0:09:57-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  cows on 30,000 acres with a number of treatments looking at reproduction, looking at nutrition,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  a whole range of things.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  And I took the stocking rate down to a base to 35 acres.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  And then at the other end, we screened a whole lot of plants that I got from the scientists  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  and that had been brought in from all over the world.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  And so we found plants that were going to grow in that environment as a result of that.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  Where we got to was we actually solved every problem we set out to solve.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  We also found a lot of problems we didn't know were there on the way through.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:44):**  And with the cow herd, for example, we took the mortality from 14% down to 2% and we took  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  the reproduction rate from 44% up to 72%.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  And increased the weight of calves taken off, etc.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  So we'd significantly increased productivity.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  But one of the things I noticed was that even when we shifted from a base to 100 acres to  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  base to 35 acres, our desirable perennial grasses were in decline.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  And within a four year period, I was measuring a decline in those good quality grasses.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  And so I went looking for solutions to that.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  And I bought a number of scientists in and I drive them around and say, look, this is  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  what's happening.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  You can see these plants, you can see things going out here.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  What's happening?  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  And the response I got on every occasion was, oh, that's just normal.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:40):**  And I tucked that away and I didn't want to accept that that was normal.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  And it wasn't until five years after that, that I then met Dr. Stan Parsons, a Zimbabwean  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  who actually had introduced cell grazing to the US with Alan Savory.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  I met him and once I started to understand what he was saying, then I had a solution  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  to what I had seen in the territory.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:07):**  By that stage, they sold the property and moved on.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  But for me, one of my big learnings was I learned not to be a reductionist, but that  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  we were working with systems.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:20):**  And I had access to people in all sorts of disciplines, experts from all over the world  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  in any field that I needed it.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:29):**  And so I had consultants and experts visited me on a regular basis and also did an enormous  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:34):**  amount of reading.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:35):**  But what I found was that a lot of, you would get an expert would come along and with their  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  blinkers on each expert could solve 80% of your problems.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  And mathematically, you get 10 experts together and they're each solving 80% of your problems  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  that straight away that doesn't work.

**[0:13:01-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  fit into an overall system that had a design and outcomes around it.

**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  developing that systems thinking and challenging everything that was going on around me.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  I didn't accept after that conventional science and stuff that was published.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  If it didn't fit and it didn't look like it was right, then it wasn't right.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  I didn't accept it.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:30):**  You were then very influential in bringing cell grazing and Stan Parsons work into Australia  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  on a really significant scale following this.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  Is that right?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:39):**  That's correct.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  So yeah, in 89 I first met Stan and immediately we decided to work together and bring stuff  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  to Australia.

**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  saying made a lot of sense because it was holistic.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  He was dealing with the people issues, the financial issues, the production issues, the

**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  All of those things were fitting together into a neat package.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  And for a while I was actually quite skeptical thinking, well, nothing's that neat.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:14):**  It can't be that neat.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  Because I was coming from reductionist training and actually reductionist experience, it took  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  me a little while to accept holism, but not just holism, but accept that when you work  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:28):**  with Mother Nature, she actually works with you and it does work.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  It does fit together, provided you get out of the way and let nature do what she wants  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:38):**  to do.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:39):**  Things are actually simpler and do fit very nicely.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  So that's where we started.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  I'm curious what this process looked like for you.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  You were approaching this from the perspective of a skeptic.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:54):**  So how did you validate to yourself, or how did you become comfortable with the idea that  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  cell grazing and this holistic approach were the right approach?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  So firstly, I was threatened by the very senior officer in the Department of Primary Industries  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  that said, look, I hear you're bringing Parsons to Australia.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  And I said, yep.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  Well, we've got a pile of literature three inches deep showing how Parsons and Savory  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  have destroyed land all over the world, wherever they've been.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  And we're going to run him out of the country.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  And if you get mixed up with him, you're going to go down with him.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  And they tried very hard to put us out of business and very, very nearly succeeded.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  And so I had to decide who was right.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  Was all this literature right?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  Or was Stan and Alan Savory right?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:41):**  And I was very fortunate to get a Churchill Fellowship.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  And that Churchill Fellowship enables me to travel through the United States and through  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  Africa, through Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  And I went everywhere where Parsons and Savory had been.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  And I went right back to their roots.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:02):**  And I visited places, people they'd trained, I visited people I'd worked with.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  And very, very quickly, it became very evident that the holistic approach and certainly the  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  water cell grazing approach to grazing was the answer to a lot of issues that we were  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  seeing in our ecosystems.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  And so that trip very quickly confirmed to me that I was right, that they were right  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:26):**  rather.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:27):**  And then I had to decide, well, how am I going to handle the opposition?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:31):**  Because every scientist, grassland and rangeland scientist in Australia was dead against what  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:38):**  we were saying.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:40):**  And the opposition was, it was phenomenal.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  And we tried to talk to them and tried to reason and ask them to come and see what we  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:48):**  were talking about and what we were doing.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  And that didn't work.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  And I remember sitting in Harare and Zimbabwe for a few days waiting for an aircraft to  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:58):**  fly home, writing up my report.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  And I had to decide how was I going to handle this opposition when I got home.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  And I decided there and then that I would never again try and convince people that did  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  not want to listen.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  And I would only work with people who were ready to listen.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  And that's what I did and the way we went.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:19):**  And it's grown enormously from there.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  And that strategy has worked really, really well.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  When you say it has grown enormously from there, I think that's a statement that needs  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:32):**  some clarification for our audience.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  It's my understanding that you have worked with close to 10,000 farmers approaching 10%  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  of Australia's farmland that has been under your coaching over the last three decades.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:48):**  Yes, it is.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  It does cover a little bit of landscape.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  Not all of that, by the way, has been successful.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  People make mistakes, don't actually get the principles or don't get the holistic approach  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  because we've all been raised in this reductionist approach to everything.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  And getting that headshift is quite significant.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:11):**  Charles Massey, who wrote the book Call of the Read Warbler, his claim, and he did his  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  PhD on looking at regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  And a big majority of the people that he interviewed were actually our clients.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  And he came to the conclusion that I'd influenced more landscape positively in Australia than  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:33):**  any other person.

**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  It's not something that we claim, but I'll take it.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:42):**  Yeah, it's a significant compliment.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  What was that pathway like from those early days of learning about holistic management  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  and Stan Parsons and Alan Savory's work, bringing that back to Australia?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  What was the pathway from there to your organization of RCS as it exists today?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  So RCS had actually existed for five years before we went down this track.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  So we were a conventional sort of consulting firm, not making much money, not making any  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  headway.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:13):**  And then I met Stan and I realized then that what I had to do basically with the rest of  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  my life.

**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  and introducing this stuff to agriculture in Australia.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:31):**  And so initially it was Pam and I, and Stan would come out two to three times a year.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  And initially he would do the teaching and it took me about three years before he would  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  allow me to do any teaching.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  And I was doing consulting and follow up in the background.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  And we realized very early on that the numbers were building quite quickly and therefore  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:51):**  the ability for me to consult and follow up with all those people was very limited.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  So we started developing group work and one of the concepts and products we developed  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  was a process called Executive Link, which is a peer to peer learning and support process.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  And it's probably one of the most powerful things that we've done.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  And Executive Link, where we put businesses together in boards of six businesses and each  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  business then helps the other business.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  And so you end up with two very powerful things.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:29):**  You end up with peer support for tough decisions and you end up with peer pressure when actions  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  are not happening.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  And the combination of those two things creates massive change and gives people the confidence  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  for the sort of changes that need to be made.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:48):**  And so in the first three years of Executive Link, it was not very successful.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  We had about a 50% attrition rate.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  In other words, 50% of people were leaving within three years.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  And so at the end of that first three year period, I sat down with one of the great guys  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  that was working with me at the time, Stuart McArthur.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  And we said, right, what's wrong with this and how do we fix it?  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  And we interviewed a lot of the people that left and we also worked out ourselves what  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:19):**  was wrong.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  And one of the things that was wrong was there was no accountability in terms of economics.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:27):**  So I then built, worked with a local university to build our own benchmarking and business  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  analysis software.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  And once we got that software into it and then everybody was benchmarking and analysing  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  their numbers in a very consistent way and those numbers were on the table, the honesty  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  levels changed and we had some real stuff to work with.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:53):**  And that was one of the catalytic things that changed the way it operated.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:00):**  And we changed some of the just sort of processes and the way we were doing it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  And so that was about 94, 95.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:09):**  We got that really starting to crank.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  And in the last 25 years, it really hasn't changed much in format and it's still as powerful  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:20):**  as it ever was.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  And what happens in that process is that it takes a little time to build trust.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  But as that trust builds, more and more stuff comes out.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  And my experience indicates that the biggest holdup in every business is not economic and  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  it's not ecological.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  It's people and it's people issues, it's communication, it's intergenerational communication and issues,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  it's gender communication and issues.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:52):**  And once people are in a very, very safe environment and they can start to bring up those very,  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  very personal issues, it's then possible to shift some of those people issues.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  And at the moment those things are out of the way, everything else then flourishes.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  Getting a very clear vision and way forward that's agreed is a real key to going from  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:19):**  there.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  I've always been intrigued by the process of trying to understand what is the process  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:29):**  that we use to make decisions, that we as humans use to make decisions.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  And it's interesting actually when you dig into the science a little bit to discover  
**[0:23:39-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  that fundamentally not a single decision is ever a logical decision, but they're all emotional.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  And there's some really interesting science behind all of that.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  I was intrigued a moment ago you mentioned Charles Massey's book, The Call of the Reed  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  Warbler, in which he described that of the people that he interviewed, 60% of the farmers  
**[0:24:03-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  began adopting regenerative agriculture practices as a result of some personal crisis.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  And whether that was a health crisis in the family or an economic crisis on the farm.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:18):**  But then it wasn't clear to me, or perhaps I missed it, it wasn't clear to me what about  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  the remaining 40%?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:23):**  And has that 60%, 40% shift been true historically?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  Is it beginning to shift now?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  So I'd love to hear your perspective.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  Are more farmers, now that you have, if you have impacted personally and through your  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  organization, if you have impacted 10% of the agricultural landscape, is it approaching  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  the threshold where it is becoming normal and people adopt a different management practice  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  without the personal crisis?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  What does the future...  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:55):**  So there's kind of two questions here.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  One is, what's the process that farmers go through to arrive at this decision?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:01):**  And how do you see that changing and shifting in the future at all?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  I believe it has shifted.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:08):**  My biggest selling point is word of mouth.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:13):**  And so our clients tend to come from recommendations and that usually there's family and then there's  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  friends and then there's local people in the local district.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  And so little groups and hubs start to develop.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  What I find now is the thing that probably drives the change and drives people into the  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  education more than the crisis is funding.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  And when there's funding available for education, people will come and do it.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  And it's a strange thing.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  It means that people are not valuing knowledge as much as they should.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  They don't value it as something that they should invest in.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:55):**  But if the government comes along and is prepared to invest in their education and that education  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  is the right education and it then turns them on to learning, then they're on a lifelong  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  learning journey from then on.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  It's interesting that I think the schooling experience is, I believe, has actually turned  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:15):**  off a lot of people to be learners.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  And once they have a really good experience with learning again, then they become much  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  more interested in continuing to learn.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  So I'm finding at the moment that probably 20% now of the people coming through our programs  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:36):**  are now second generation.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  In other words, I've taught their parents and these are now people in their late teens  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  through to mid-20s or so that are now coming through.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  And I've been around long enough now to, I'm up to number nine of grandchildren.

**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:21):**  rule of thumb, the majority of people that were coming to our programs were from 45 up.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  Now the vast majority are from 45 down.

**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  was succession.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  And I found that the generation that's in the late 70s and into their 80s and 90s now  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  did not do succession well.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:51):**  They held things to themselves.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  They were poor communicators and they made it very, very hard for the next generation.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  Right now we're finding that the baby boomers are starting to do succession.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  And as a general rule, I find that they're doing it earlier and they're doing it better.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:13):**  And so I think that's a reason why we're getting a lot of younger people coming through.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:19):**  So now, whereas 15 years ago we would have had an executive link, for example, we would

**[0:28:55-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  at least, we're at a moment in time right now where 50% of the farmland in the country  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  needs to go through succession in the next 10 to 15 years.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  And that's more farmland changing hands than has ever changed hands in such a condensed  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  period ever before in history here in the country.

**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:25):**  What have you observed that has made that, what has brought about to this shift from  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  the prior generation to the current generation facilitating succession much more smoothly?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:36):**  Firstly, it's being talked about a lot more.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  There's field days and there's workshops and all sorts of things now where succession is  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  being encouraged and talked about.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  I think that's the first thing.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  In terms of supporting succession, in my mind, there's absolutely no doubt that the thing  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  that makes it either smooth or bad is communication.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:03):**  Part of that communication is respect.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  And it's respect in both directions.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  Younger generation must respect the ownership of the older and the knowledge of an older  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:14):**  generation and the older generation must respect the needs of a younger generation.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  The worst thing that I think families can do is go and talk to lawyers and accountants  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  to have them deal with succession.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  Immediately, that just starts the thing down the track of dealing with function, dealing  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:35):**  with structure rather than with communication.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  So my belief is that they need to do some training themselves in communication and learn  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  how to communicate better, understand different personality types.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:50):**  All of that makes a big difference.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  So communication, firstly, the second point then is that once you're able to communicate,  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  honesty and putting things on the table, including goals and visions.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  It's surprising how many times the older generation expects the younger generation wants to come  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  home and take over the farm when the younger generation is only there or doing it because  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  they feel obliged to do it and it's not actually their real dream.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  And I think one of the things that has to happen very early is everybody's goals, visions  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  and dreams need to be on the table.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:29):**  And succession needs to be a process and a discussion that takes everybody towards their  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:35):**  dreams and not just assume that that is a farm.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:40):**  And I find in the older generation, there's many, many women that, particularly in remote  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  areas that have spent, given up their life to be on the land and in remote areas and  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:54):**  really want to spend the last 20 or so years of their life back in society and doing other  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  things.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:00):**  And so again, there needs to be a little bit of give and take even within generations as  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:06):**  to where we go.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  But it's absolutely important that all of that's on the table and understood.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:13):**  So communication, goals, visions, respect and then I think facilitation.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  I think it's important for families to have external facilitators to help bring together  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  and use a process to facilitate succession.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  And those facilitators should not be the family accountant or the family lawyer.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  They should be people with skills in facilitation because you're going to be dealing with tears,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  you're going to be dealing with all sorts of emotions.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  And this is an emotional process on both sides and we all need to understand that and it's  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  not easy for any side.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:54):**  So I think those are the sort of ways that we tend to try and help it.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:59):**  I find I'm intrigued by the direction this conversation has gone rather than having a  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  conversation about agronomy and field management, as you mentioned early on, it is really about  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:10):**  people.

**[0:33:20-0:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  and impact, which means that RCS as a consulting organization has been successful at guiding  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:29):**  and supporting and helping people rather than just focusing on the agronomy or regenerative  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  management or grazing or whatever the agronomic context might be.

**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  What has, what's the process look like of really supporting people?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  Okay, there's two things that you're dealing with.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  One is wants and the other is needs.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:56):**  And the thing that most people will talk about is their wants.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  If you start asking questions, you'll get the wants.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:02):**  You won't necessarily get to the needs.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:06):**  And I think the key to our success is that we tend to market to wants and we start with  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  wants and wants are meeting people where they're at.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:16):**  But over time, you've got to meet needs and needs are deeper and to get to needs and feelings,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  you've got to have a level of trust, level of understanding.

**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  intensive education.

**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:05):**  that people need at the time.

**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  Some of them are still on the land and still producing, but they want to give back.

**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  with either a 20 year old or a 70 year old couple, for example, and deal with whatever

**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  And it's that ability to deal holistically with whatever the family is dealing with.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  So I class myself as a specialist generalist.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:31):**  And I don't think there are very many specialist generalists.

**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  as well.

**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  I think the thing that was one of my biggest epiphanies was, and this was 30 odd years  
**[0:38:35-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  ago, is that agriculture can and should be based on ecosystem health and not be extractive  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:46):**  in a sense that we're degrading landscape.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  And that if we work with ecosystems and we understand how those ecosystems work and work  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  with them and with a really simple set of principles, then life gets easier and a whole

**[0:39:12-0:39:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  stuff, the one bit that always grabs the attention, the excitement and creates that first excitement  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:22):**  and that first glimmer of change with farmers is understanding they're working on an ecosystem  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:29):**  and understanding that there's a few tools that they're using and they're using them  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:34):**  either to damage it or to improve it.

**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  I guess one way to put it is a client of mine once said that he thought he was a livestock  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  producer and then he came to one of our programs and went away thinking that he was a grass  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  producer.

**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  And it's that change that, as you understand then that if you're a soil or an ecosystem  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  manager, the production will actually, and the economics will actually look after itself.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  So that I don't think has changed.

**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:29):**  and just put that aside.

**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:36):**  asked it to do what they wanted it to do.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  And then he got another glass of water straight out of that well, out of the pump immediately  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  and got people to taste the water before and after.

**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:58):**  You use the words a moment ago of the small water cycle.

**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  What is the what if there's a small one, I'm assuming there's a big one.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  How do the two compare and how can our behaviour in agriculture influence them?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:14):**  Right.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  So the big one is mainly the one that operates over the oceans and the small water cycle  
**[0:57:19-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:19):**  is recycling water within our landscape.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  There's a number of things that we've done there to change that.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  So losing the carbon means that we've actually lost the storage, the water storage and water  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:35):**  holding capacity within our soils.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:38):**  That carbons in the atmosphere and that moisture is in the atmosphere, both the carbon and  
**[0:57:42-0:57:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  the moisture.

**[0:57:48-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  than the CO2 is.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  But we can return that moisture to the landscape, which allows it to recycle on the landscape.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  The second thing that we've done that has changed the small water cycle is we're maintaining  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:04):**  large areas of bare country.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  In Australia, we do what's called bare fallowing.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:08):**  So we use glyphosate to spray out anything that grows when it rains so we can store moisture  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:15):**  to grow a crop.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:17):**  It's something that's very, very inefficient.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:19):**  We get to store somewhere about 20 to 25 per cent of the moisture that falls, but in the  
**[0:58:25-0:58:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  process we're actually stopping it from falling.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:28):**  So we know from large scale where landscapes have been cleared on a large scale that when  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:35):**  you've got bare soil, the reflectance of energy from that soil changes and will actually drive  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:42):**  clouds away from raining in that area.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  And a classic example of that, and I don't know whether this happens in the United States  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:51):**  or not, but it certainly happens in Australia.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  When we have our early storms at the break of a season, those storms will follow a pathway.  
**[0:59:00-0:59:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:00):**  But all subsequent storms tend to follow that same pathway then.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:04):**  The reason is that the first pathway they'll generally follow where the landscape is cooler  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:10):**  and then because that's had rain, that landscape is cooler again and subsequent storms will  
**[0:59:15-0:59:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  tend to follow the same pathway.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:17):**  So bare land just affects radiant heat and therefore the weather clouds will hang around.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:25):**  And the third influence of bare ground is not having the Pseudomonas syringae there  
**[0:59:33-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:33):**  to seed clouds.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  So on our plants we've got the biology, the Pseudomonas syringae floats up into the air  
**[0:59:42-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:42):**  and seeds clouds before any other particle.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  In other words, they can colonise water vapour into particles at a higher temperature than  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:52):**  dust or pollution particles and then create rain and then down comes the rain, brings  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:58):**  them back down again, they get on our plants again and then back they go to the atmosphere  
**[1:00:02-1:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  and you then have this cycle.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:05):**  So I believe that a landscape that is not hydrated is a landscape that drives rain away  
**[1:00:15-1:00:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  and lowers rainfall in that landscape and that's the small water cycle.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:19):**  So the small water cycle is transpiration and evaporation but obviously we want it to  
**[1:00:25-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:25):**  be driven by transpiration rather than evaporation.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  And that keeps it moving rather than evaporation and it's that cycling back into our crops  
**[1:00:34-1:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:34):**  and our plants that is what we need to maintain.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:37):**  Earlier you mentioned that we have limited the capacity of the small water cycle because  
**[1:00:46-1:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:46):**  we have decarbonised our soil.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:48):**  We often think of the carbon content in our soil and its capacity to influence soil structures  
**[1:00:56-1:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:56):**  that we have better water infiltration and better percolation which are two different  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:00):**  things that I think are sometimes forgotten.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:03):**  So it's common to think of carbon in terms of water storage capacity but how does carbon,  
**[1:01:12-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  increased carbon levels in our soil actually influence the water cycle?  
**[1:01:15-1:01:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  Can you finish connecting those dots for me?  
**[1:01:18-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:18):**  Because when you've got more water stored in the soil you're able to grow more plants  
**[1:01:22-1:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  and therefore you transpire, in other words it's a cycle.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:26):**  The water, it's more able to come from rainfall because you've got plants growing and you've  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  got the cloud seeding happening and then you've got storage of that water when it does hit  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  the ground which will then grow more plants which will create the transpiration which  
**[1:01:43-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:43):**  will then move that cycle around and keep it rolling.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  If we don't have transpiration we have evaporation and then that is water that we have made no  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:53):**  use of and it's then lost to the atmosphere and we don't have the cloud seeding to go  
**[1:01:58-1:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  with it and we can also, on bigger areas, we can also be changing the reflectance, the  
**[1:02:05-1:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:05):**  heat reflectance at a ground level.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:07):**  The carbon I think is essential to driving that cycle.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:11):**  The other part of it from my perspective is taking that water vapour out of the atmosphere  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  and putting it away in the soil.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:19):**  I believe that that can have as bigger influence, if not a bigger influence on the climate change  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:26):**  than CO2 will have.

**[1:02:43-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:43):**  the impact of that for us very eloquently.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  Yeah, Walter describes it very, very well.

**[1:02:54-1:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  to managing soil carbon and improving soil carbon.

**[1:07:25-1:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:25):**  we had clients that were obviously sequestering carbon and I thought, well, wouldn't it be

**[1:08:09-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:09):**  Do we have a continually increasing storage capacity?

**[1:08:14-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:14):**  What do the overall dynamics of these numbers look like that you've been talking about?  
**[1:08:19-1:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  And then the, well, let's start there.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:22):**  Okay.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:23):**  So let me answer that one first, because that's a very, very important question.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:28):**  Agronomically, we've been taught that soils will reach an equilibrium of carbon and we  
**[1:08:34-1:08:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:34):**  can't put any more away.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:36):**  I believe that's a false assumption, firstly, because we're measuring it as a percentage,  
**[1:08:42-1:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:42):**  not as volume.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:44):**  So the first thing, and most of our soils are measured in the top six inches.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:51):**  First thing that happens as we start sequestering carbon is it will start going down deeper.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:56):**  In our process, we measure down at least a metre and a half where we can get down that  
**[1:09:00-1:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  far and we're expecting to fill that space up with carbon.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:06):**  When your surface reaches that equilibrium percentage, carbon will go one of two ways.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  It will continue to push down or it will continue to grow up.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:17):**  So my belief is that there is absolutely no limit, no limit whatsoever to the amount of  
**[1:09:23-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  carbon we can put away in soils, because it's carbon that builds soils.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:30):**  So if we reach an equilibrium in the surface or even over one and a half metres, all that  
**[1:09:35-1:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:35):**  will happen is we then continue to build soil.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:38):**  And what can be wrong with that?  
**[1:09:40-1:09:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  And that's essentially how our soils got built, those beautiful soils that you talked about  
**[1:09:44-1:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:44):**  earlier in the United States got built by that process and grasslands and grazing animals.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:50):**  So there is absolutely no limit to what we can put away.  
**[1:09:56-1:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  And I think we need to break that paradigm.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:58):**  We think about it in terms of percentages.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:00):**  We've got to think about it in terms of tonnes.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:02):**  In terms of sequestration rates, your soils there, I think have got potential of two and  
**[1:10:08-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  three tonnes and more per hectare, potentially up to 10 tonnes of carbon per hectare per  
**[1:10:14-1:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  year.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:15):**  That's 10 tonnes of carbon per acre, roughly the same number.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:18):**  And so if you convert that then into monetary terms, I'll use 10 tonnes because it's a high  
**[1:10:27-1:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:27):**  number but it's a round number as well.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:30):**  What you're putting into soil is carbon, organic carbon is what we're measuring.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:36):**  But what you get to sell is carbon dioxide.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  And the multiplier from carbon to carbon dioxide is 3.67.  
**[1:10:45-1:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:45):**  So 10 tonnes of carbon added to your soil is 36.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:53):**  That's actually what you get to sell.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:55):**  So if the price of carbon was $10 a tonne for CO2, and that's a low price at the moment  
**[1:11:02-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  in California, it's nearly double that, would give you a gross income there of $360 per  
**[1:11:11-1:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  hectare per annum.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:12):**  So a hectare is two and a half acres in a hectare, which is pretty nice little bit of  
**[1:11:17-1:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:17):**  income on top of what you're already doing.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:19):**  Now there are discounts on that because there's variability in the measurement and there's  
**[1:11:24-1:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  some discounts that make that a safe thing to trade.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:28):**  But that's essentially how it works.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:30):**  You add carbon, you multiply it by 3.67 and you sell CO2.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:35):**  And it's that multiplier that makes it work.

**[1:11:47-1:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:47):**  And it's a significant one as well.

**[1:11:55-1:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:55):**  What are the possibilities of this being realised sometime in the near future for growers in

**[1:12:06-1:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:06):**  how distant is this in the future?  
**[1:12:08-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:08):**  In Australia, it's been possible since 2014.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  We actually got the legislation in 2011.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:15):**  Then we got an improved methodology in 2018.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:19):**  So we're currently doing it and we can sell credits from soil carbon in Australia.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:24):**  So we've got one, our first farmer at the moment that we measured four years ago.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:29):**  We've just re-measured him.

**[1:12:36-1:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:36):**  And that was measured over three years and two of those three years were severe drought.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:42):**  So that's pretty exciting for us to have the first sort of big chunk of carbon credits  
**[1:12:47-1:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:47):**  from soils heading towards the market.

**[1:12:53-1:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:53):**  I think in terms of the soil carbon market globally, it is one of the most exciting spaces  
**[1:13:00-1:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:00):**  around the world at the moment.

**[1:13:15-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:15):**  At the moment, you've essentially got the California market in the US.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  So unless you're able to sell into that market, you've then got to look for large organisations  
**[1:13:25-1:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  that want to offset their carbon.

**[1:13:32-1:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:32):**  you come back a few years later and re-measure it.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:35):**  What you get to sell is the change from your baseline to your re-measurement.  
**[1:13:40-1:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:40):**  So you don't actually have anything to sell for a number of years.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:43):**  But I think that there's a lot of interest in getting this going in the States and we've  
**[1:13:48-1:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:48):**  got probably some of the best technology in the world now because we've been working on  
**[1:13:52-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:52):**  the technology to measure this more accurately for about seven or eight years.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  We're in the final stages of R&D at the moment and we'll be rolling out some of that technology  
**[1:14:03-1:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:03):**  in Australia next year.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  And there's interest in taking that technology into the US as well now.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:09):**  So I think you will see it within a few years.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:12):**  I think your market will start to grow.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:15):**  There are traps for young players.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  I think there's two ways that the carbon market will operate.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:21):**  One is a modelled method.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:23):**  So if you shift to no-till, for example, then it's deemed that you're going to sequester  
**[1:14:27-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:27):**  so many carbon credits.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  The market does not like that stuff because it's not measured and they don't trust it.  
**[1:14:35-1:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:35):**  Measured carbon then has a high value and also soil carbon credits come with a lot of  
**[1:14:41-1:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:41):**  co-benefits.  
**[1:14:43-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:43):**  So they come with those benefits of water or food quality or biodiversity.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  There's a whole lot of co-benefits that come with it.

**[1:14:55-1:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  market.

**[1:15:03-1:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:03):**  The exciting thing for me is that you can only sequester carbon if you're doing regenerative  
**[1:15:08-1:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:08):**  practices.

**[1:15:18-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:18):**  And I can't think of any better thing to have happening globally.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  You've had a significant influence on the shift to regeneration in the Australian landscape,

**[1:15:47-1:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:47):**  adoption in Australia?

**[1:15:51-1:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/REGEN_AG_PODCAST_TERRY_MCCOSKER_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:15:51):**  There's the grazing industries and the cropping industries.

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 23:08:36)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm John Kempf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:06):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:40):**  topics that you would like for me to discuss, please connect on LinkedIn or on Twitter,

**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:54):**  very much like to hear from you and to hear your feedback. Be sure to subscribe to this podcast,  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:01:59):**  and thank you very much for listening. Enjoy the show. Greetings, friends, and welcome to the  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:04):**  Regenerative Agriculture podcast. On this podcast, we explore the science and practical application  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:09):**  of regenerative agriculture ecosystems, how to regenerate soil health, crop health and quality,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:15):**  and increase overall farm profitability. Our goal is to give you clear and easy to understand  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:21):**  information and actionable information that you can actually implement on your operation.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:25):**  In this episode, I'm very excited to welcome Bob Klamer to the podcast. Robert has a lifetime of  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:35):**  very rich experience in the agricultural space working both for the USDA and for the University  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:40):**  of Missouri in a variety of different areas related to plant sciences and soil microbiology,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:46):**  looking at the interactions of soil microbiology and weeds, weed seeds, weed germination, and a  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:53):**  whole range of different topics that tie into looking at soil health and developing suppressive  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:02:59):**  soils. So Robert, welcome to the podcast. We're very honored to have you. Thank you, John. It's  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:04):**  good to be here. So Robert, you've done a lot of very interesting work. What are some of your  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:10):**  most memorable moments that led you to where you are today and some of the things that you work on?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:15):**  Oh, well, yeah, it's been several years to culminate to where I'm at today, I guess, but  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:23):**  I, you know, I think probably the first challenge was with the appointment with the USDA Agricultural  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:32):**  Research Service when I was asked to look at possibilities of decomposing weed seeds and soil  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:39):**  using microbiological approaches that really no one had really looked at doing before because  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:46):**  at the time that I came into the agency in the early 80s, it was pretty much everything was  
**[0:03:50-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:50):**  chemical-based as far as weed management and actually any sort of pest management.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:03:58):**  And so to have a challenge like that was pretty unique at the time. And really, you know, looking  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:06):**  for native microorganisms that could essentially rot seeds and soil was a pretty challenging  
**[0:04:14-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:14):**  task. But that really kind of led things into really looking at more at plant and soil microbial  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:25):**  interactions and leading to natural ways of trying to control weeds using biological control  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:33):**  approaches. And that was kind of started the way into looking at, well, you know, what do pesticides  
**[0:04:41-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:41):**  do when they're in the management system? And that eventually led to my interest in soil quality,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:49):**  which was the big buzzword at the time that evolved into soil health. And, you know, with soil health,  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:04:56):**  folks are looking at management assessment approaches. And at the time that we really got  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:03):**  into it, that's when the genetically modified crop issue came into vogue or into wide practice.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:11):**  And then on top of that, you add the whole Roundup or glyphosate issue. And certainly no one was  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:17):**  really looking at that as that being a factor that was affecting soil health. And so, you know,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:23):**  we kind of diverged and looked into that for a while as well. So, you know, I'd say I probably  
**[0:05:28-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:28):**  hit about a half a dozen highlights over the career that I've had. And it always seemed  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:37):**  like if you turn the corner going to something else, then it was a very interesting challenge.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:42):**  You've mentioned a number of very intriguing pieces that I want to follow up on. But let's  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:49):**  perhaps begin at the beginning. When you described your early work in seeking to develop  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:05:55):**  microbiological control of weed seeds and weed germination, did you have any success in developing  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:01):**  biological controls? And are there any tools available for farmers to use today?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:06):**  Well, I would say that a lot of the work that we started, all the research that we started,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:12):**  eventually was served as a pattern for others to take that up and pursue that kind of development.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:22):**  You know, we had some... My main task was to try to look at controlling these weeds in annual  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:32):**  row cropping situations. And it was almost impossible because, especially if you want  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:38):**  to call it conventional or modern type input-based agro ecosystems, so many weed seeds had been built  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:46):**  up over the years, plus the fact that they were so diverse. You know, you had a number of weed  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:52):**  seeds in the field that, you know, we were very... Although we found some bacteria and fungi that  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:06:59):**  could affect maybe two or three weed species, you know, we would still have in some situations,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:05):**  seven or eight weed species in the field that would still be problematic. So it came to the  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:12):**  point that in a midwestern situation with corn and soybeans, it was almost impossible to come  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:18):**  up with something that was effective biologically within the framework that the practices that were  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:25):**  in place. And, you know, I'm talking about a short rotation of corn and soybean, no cover crops to  
**[0:07:31-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:31):**  build up the microbial diversity and continuous chemical application. So, but I will say that  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:39):**  our work did kind of set the stage for others in other parts of the country that have developed  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:45):**  these types of organisms. For instance, in the Pacific Northwest where cereal crops are the  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:52):**  dominant production system and where there's only one or two weeds in the system, such as downy  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:07:58):**  brome or jointed goat grass, they used this kind of approach. And there is some organisms  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:05):**  available today that are under development for commercial applications in those types of systems,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:10):**  where it would work. That is fascinating. I was going to ask you about other types of ecosystems  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:15):**  where this would be appropriate. Has there... Are you aware of any development work that has been  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:20):**  done that would be relevant for fruit and vegetable production systems or where you have  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:27):**  agriculture ecosystems that do have a longer crop rotation incorporating cover crops and so forth?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:33):**  Has there been any work done on those areas? Well, there's been a little bit. You know, some of the...  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:38):**  There's been some Canadian work. The Canadian Agri-Food Canada has really supported this  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:46):**  type of approach. And for instance, there was a specific pathogen they developed for a particular  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:08:53):**  weed in horticultural crops such as strawberries. And that was particularly effective. It was  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:00):**  against a... I think it was an annual weed. It was a mallow weed. It was in the cotton family.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:05):**  And there are a few other examples, but really, the effort that has put into this  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:13):**  relative to the number of products that are available is very lopsided. I would say there's  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:21):**  not that much out there. And I would say that one of the problems is for development of such  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:28):**  a product to go to market. There's a lot of companies out there that don't want to take  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:32):**  that risk, especially if the crop is not a high value, that's not going to bring a lot of profit  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:38):**  back to them. So that's always been an obstacle as well. One of the pieces that you mentioned was the  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:44):**  impact of pesticides on biological processes in the soil. Could you elaborate a little bit on what  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:50):**  you've observed the impact of various pesticides to be? Sure. It's been somewhat variable.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:09:59):**  I mean, what we're finding is some pesticides will be, let's say, detrimental or toxic to just a  
**[0:10:06-0:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:06):**  group of microorganisms in the overall soil community. And the same ones may stimulate other  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:15):**  components of the microbial community. And then you would end up with this imbalance of the various  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:23):**  microorganisms that are in the soil. Now, a very good example of this was in the late 70s, early  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:32):**  80s, we had a lot of soil applied herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. And these were going  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:38):**  on at very high rates. Some of them, you might recall, furadans as one of the insecticides and  
**[0:10:47-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:47):**  EPT-C or sutan herbicides, they went on pounds per acre. And the other interesting issue with  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:10:55):**  those were that their chemical structure had a group in there that was very similar to  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:01):**  what you find in proteins, the peptide bond, or they called it the carbamate bond. And these  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:07):**  really stimulated a lot of microorganisms that were able to use proteins. They just adapted  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:13):**  and used those for metabolism. And the first thing we had, we had a lot of pesticide failures  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:18):**  due to that. And then that's when we evolved into more post-emergence type herbicides that  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:25):**  everyone thought, well, that's going to take care of that issue. And then what happened after that,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:31):**  we got a lot of, we began getting a lot of herbicide resistant weeds. And this was even before  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:36):**  we had the Roundup resistant weeds. We had a lot of ALS inhibitor resistance and even atrazine  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:44):**  resistance in the weeds. What was also happening at that same time was that with continuous  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:50):**  application of these same herbicides that was causing weed resistance, it was also altering the  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:11:58):**  soil microbial community at the same time. Because what we often forget, let's say like in the case  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:05):**  of glyphosate, is that even though we're applying it to take out all weeds in a genetically modified  
**[0:12:12-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:12):**  crop that is tolerant to glyphosate, only about 5% of what's applied is being taken up by the weed.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:22):**  We have all the rest of it is taken up by the resistant plant, the resistant crop,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:29):**  and the other and the remaining proportion is reaching the soil in some means or another.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:36):**  You add to that fact that being a systemic herbicide, that compound is released throughout  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:42):**  the plant and it goes to the growing points, which includes the roots. So we have a lot of  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:46):**  that compound being released into the soil, into the rhizosphere where you have the most active  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:53):**  and dominant communities of microorganisms because that's where all the nutrients are being released  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:12:59):**  by plants and that's where you find most of your microorganisms. We get glyphosate in there.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:07):**  I have to admit over the last 20 years, that's the one herbicide I've worked with most.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:12):**  We've documented that glyphosate will affect or is active in the root zone of genetically modified crops  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:22):**  as just like it is in the root zones of weeds. It's released, it causes a lot of leakage of  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:29):**  nutrients, the sugars, carbohydrates, and amino acids out of the roots and this stimulates a  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:35):**  certain segment of the community. In this case, a lot of fusarium fungi and some of the other  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:42):**  detrimental bacteria like agrobacterium and those that oxidize manganese that makes it  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:48):**  unavailable to the plant. So often the resistant plant or the resistant crop that's soybean or corn  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:13:58):**  will not be infected by these organisms because they're able to resist it, but they are setting  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:06):**  up a shift in the microbes in the soil that can be detrimental to other plants. It can be  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:13):**  detrimental to other microorganisms and now what we're finding is that even though we've been  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:19):**  told that glyphosate dissipates and is neutralized and is degraded, we're finding residual glyphosate  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:25):**  in the soil now. That's where we're at now. We don't know exactly what that residual glyphosate  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:32):**  at whatever concentrations they are after the crop is gone, what they're doing to the whole soil ecosystem.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:40):**  So this is fascinating. You've mentioned a number of interesting pieces.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:45):**  Let's perhaps begin with your last point of residual glyphosate. How long do you find that  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:53):**  glyphosate residues are remaining in the soil profile application? Well, we've really started  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:14:59):**  looking at this in a, well not even a systematic manner, but at least in a cursory manner beginning  
**[0:15:06-0:15:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:06):**  in 2014. We were looking in field plots at the time because one of the projects was  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:15):**  can we come up with some treatment that might be able to overcome the effects of  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:20):**  glyphosate on the soil function or microbial activity and function. So we had these  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:27):**  these soils analyzed and half the plots had not received glyphosate for at least a year and  
**[0:15:32-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:32):**  the other half had received glyphosate during the growing season. And when we had that analyzed,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:40):**  we found that plots that had gone a year without Roundup application, some of those plots had  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:47):**  as high residual glyphosate as the plots that received the glyphosate in the current year.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:53):**  So that was amazing to us because that did show us we are seeing a carryover of the  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:15:59):**  glyphosate. And the other interesting thing was that it was random.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:06):**  We had how a field plot design is set up in a very structured arrangement.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:13):**  Maybe one plot that received glyphosate might be over a thousand parts per billion and  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:20):**  then another plot that received the same treatment may only be at 350. So there's a lot of  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:26):**  factors going on here that affect persistence of this particular active ingredient. And if I could  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:34):**  just add one more thing, so that was the first year where we only detected glyphosate alone.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:40):**  In the last two years, we've been using a different lab that is able to separate glyphosate  
**[0:16:47-0:16:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:47):**  from its major breakdown product which is aminomethyl phosphonic acid. That's the AMPA or AMPA  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:16:55):**  that we talk a lot about. And that metabolite can be just as toxic as glyphosate itself.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:01):**  So we have those two compounds analyzed, the glyphosate and the AMPA, we find about anywhere  
**[0:17:08-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:08):**  from 10 to 50 times more AMPA than glyphosate. And what that indicates is that glyphosate  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:18):**  can be degraded by the microbes by one step but then when it gets to AMPA, the enzymes to  
**[0:17:26-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:26):**  further break that down is not there within that microbial community. And thus, it's either  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:34):**  they've been wiped out due to intensive farming or other herbicides or glyphosate itself but it's  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:41):**  pretty interesting. And we're finding the AMPA to be carried over by more than a year or two as well.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:47):**  What are the implications of high concentrations of AMPA in the soil profile? Do they have a similar  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:52):**  effect on the soil biology as what you described for glyphosate? Oh yes, it has a very similar  
**[0:17:58-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:17:58):**  effect because the active group in glyphosate and in AMPA is the same. It's that phosphonate  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:08):**  group. So as far as you listen to Dr. Huber and then talk about chelation of micronutrients by  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:16):**  glyphosate, well AMPA will do the same thing because it has not been degraded to the point  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:22):**  where it loses that characteristic. So it can, you know, it can sorb the soil, it can exchange with phosphorus in the soil just like glyphosate.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:30):**  So I have kind of two related questions. One, back at the beginning when we first started this  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:38):**  conversation, you mentioned that you had done some work looking at soil quality and looking at soil  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:46):**  health. So I have a question around that which is what defines soil quality? What defines soil  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:53):**  health? How do you know that you have a healthy soil? And then the follow-up question to that is  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:18:59):**  based on the pieces that we've just been talking about around glyphosate and AMPA, how do, what are  
**[0:19:04-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:04):**  the long-term impacts of soil quality by these compounds? Oh okay, yeah so I'll go with the term  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:13):**  soil health. Soil health is a little more holistic and it really emphasizes soil  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:21):**  biological function and as well as the microbial component. Soil quality was originally proposed  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:30):**  mainly to see how well your management is in terms of providing an acceptable agronomic production.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:38):**  You see, so and they didn't really emphasize the environmental effects as much. So anyway,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:46):**  that might be a picky point but I'll just go with soil health. So you know what makes a soil healthy  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:52):**  is of course you have to look at in the context of, you know, similar soils within a given landscape  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:19:59):**  and there are several indicators that will suggest good soil health but the two main ones  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:07):**  is soil organic matter or soil organic carbon and the microbial diversity. Certainly we're getting  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:15):**  to the point where we can quantify differences in soil health based on what I would call soil organic  
**[0:20:22-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:22):**  carbon quality which is a fairly high proportion of the overall soil organic carbon or soil organic  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:31):**  matter is in a pool called labile carbon or active carbon and that's important because that is the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:39):**  portion of carbon that supports the microbial community in the soil plus it can serve as a  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:47):**  source of substrates or energy for growing plants as well as the activity of the microorganisms that  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:20:54):**  are involved in all the nutrient cycling and plant growth protection. So you know having a  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:00):**  having a soil with a good proportion of labile carbon is real important. Now I can't tell you,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:06):**  you know, what the proportion should be, you know, maybe it's 25 or upwards of 50 percent but that  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:13):**  just kind of depends on the quality of organic matter that has been returned to the soil over  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:19):**  the years. Certainly in a ecologically based farming system where you have a lot of diverse  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:25):**  plant material and maybe compost additions and that active carbon is going to be quite that high  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:30):**  and the quality is going to be as high as well but then connected with that is this microbial  
**[0:21:37-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:37):**  diversity. That primarily means that you have a diversity in the types of fungi and the types of  
**[0:21:46-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:46):**  bacteria as well as a good component of things like protozoa that kind of complete the food web  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:21:55):**  and feeding on these fungal and bacterial communities to kind of keep them unbalanced  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:00):**  but also recycles nitrogen and phosphorus through their decomposition of microbial biomass.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:07):**  Plus the diversity of these, let's say the bacteria is important because you need several  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:15):**  different species in order to accomplish a function. In other words, you know, an example  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:22):**  would be if we have corn stover on the surface of the soil or just into the surface, one  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:29):**  microorganism cannot break that vegetative material down to mineralize the carbon and nitrogen  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:35):**  out of it and form organic matter. You have to have a successional group of microorganisms,  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:43):**  often we say they're consortia that work together to break all this material down and to  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:51):**  get the beneficial effects out of that. And oftentimes we see this in soils that I would  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:22:58):**  say are not as healthy, soils that have been planted to let's say genetically modified corn  
**[0:23:05-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:05):**  for example, modified for BT production and maybe a Roundup Ready or glyphosate resistance.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:15):**  Sometimes we find corn stocks in these fields for three or four years after the  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:21):**  crop was harvested and these things are just laying on the ground and not being decomposed.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:26):**  And I believe what's happening is that we have really caused an imbalance in the overall  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:31):**  soil microbial community that just can't get the decomposition job done. And there are  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:38):**  other things you can check with for soil health assessments such as rate of respiration or  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:43):**  carbon dioxide evolution out of the soil which indicates good microbial activity and enzyme  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:50):**  activity and all that. And then with biological indicators, there should be some physical  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:23:57):**  and chemical indicators as well. And these are fairly obvious things that we've already  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:03):**  known about through soil testing such as the amount of available phosphorus and pH and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:10):**  then on the other hand, the bulk density, the aggregate stability or the proportion  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:15):**  of aggregates in the soil. We take all those things together and I don't want to get into  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:20):**  the technicality of it but we are coming to the point where we can model all these  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:26):**  indicators and put these into a model and come up with a soil health index. And that's  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:31):**  what's going to be important when we begin looking at comparing management systems as  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:37):**  well as using that information to come up with guidelines that farmers can use to actually  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:43):**  improve their management to improve soil health. And I think that's the most lacking piece  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:48):**  of information right now is that there's not a whole lot of guidelines out there for the  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:24:53):**  guy who's out in the field. And we can research all this as much as we want but it's not  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:00):**  going to do any good until we have something that is usable by the farmer.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:04):**  So if I'm a farmer today, how would you advise me to begin measuring some of these pieces?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:10):**  Are there any lab reports or any laboratories that are doing this type of analysis at the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:14):**  moment that I could begin establishing a baseline of where my soils are at the moment?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:20):**  Yeah, that's right. There are a few around the country that will do this, both commercial  
**[0:25:26-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:26):**  and extension type of labs. There's a lab out in Nebraska called Ward's Lab. They do  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:35):**  this kind of thing and they include a profile of your soil microbial communities. It tells  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:41):**  you what the different main components are there and gives you an idea of also how much  
**[0:25:47-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:47):**  microbial biomass you have. Cornell University has a soil health lab that does similar things  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:25:58):**  and there's another one out east. And we have a soil health assessment center here. At the  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:04):**  University of Missouri, it's still kind of in the formative stages. It does real well  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:10):**  with chemical analysis and it does do one analysis for microbial diversity. So one can  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:18):**  send soil samples to any of those labs and some have better reports on your results or  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:26):**  interpretation than others. And that would be a good way to get started on assessing  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:33):**  your soil health. Also, some states have incentives for farmers to do this. I know the Natural  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:41):**  Resource and Conservation Service here in Missouri will subsidize some of the testing  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:48):**  for farmers to have this done because they have a program. I think NRCS nationwide has  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:26:55):**  a soil health program where they're trying to improve soil health and maintain it and  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:00):**  they're trying to get farmers to get behind this and they are paying them to do that kind  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:04):**  of assessment.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:05):**  Coming back to the conversation around glyphosate and AMPA, you've described a little bit what  
**[0:27:11-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:11):**  soil health means and perhaps we have time to later explore the labile carbon soluble  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:19):**  carbon component or active carbon component. But I'd like to come back to the one question  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:23):**  I asked which was how does glyphosate and the accumulation of glyphosate and AMPA over  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:29):**  extended periods impact the overall soil health?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:32):**  Well I can give you a little bit of information that at least we can see that there's some  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:39):**  indirect effect of continuous use of glyphosate on soil health because we usually will measure  
**[0:27:47-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:47):**  a lot of the biological parameters when we set up assessments such as this. We see there's  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:27:57):**  some effects on some of the beneficial bacteria that are involved in plant growth promotion  
**[0:28:03-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:03):**  such as producing plant growth regulators that stimulate root growth and other beneficial  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:11):**  bacteria that will produce pathogen suppressive compounds. What we're noticing is that glyphosate  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:19):**  tends to suppress those beneficial groups of bacteria so that has an effect on subsequent  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:28):**  plant growth as well. So we feel that there's a problem there. I briefly mentioned the effect  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:35):**  on some of these microorganisms that are known to cause certain micronutrients to be immobilized  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:42):**  and therefore not available for plant uptake. And one of these is manganese and manganese  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:50):**  of course is a very important for activity of many enzymes that are involved in many  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:28:56):**  of our metabolic pathways. And if that's tied up, you may have poor photosynthesis, you  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:03):**  may have a poor amino acid formation because you don't have enough of that micronutrient  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:08):**  to satisfy the needs of the enzyme. So we have found for example the Fusarium that will  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:14):**  colonize the roots of plants that are treated with glyphosate. They are manganese oxidizers.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:22):**  So they immobilize manganese and if they're on the root system, they're not going to be  
**[0:29:26-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:26):**  taken up. And if they are built up in the soil, whether there is a genetically modified  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:34):**  crop there or not, they're going to remain in the soil and they're going to continue  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:39):**  to immobilize manganese. So if you don't have a lot of available manganese, that's going  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:43):**  to affect the overall soil health as well. You get into a lot of other things, things  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:50):**  such as glyphosate may exchange with phosphorus in the soil and then you have problems with  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:29:58):**  either excess phosphorus or phosphorus being, if it's not being taken up by the plants,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:04):**  it can be an environmental problem. So we mentioned the probability of effect of the  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:14):**  quality of the organic matter because we're using basically just two crops that are the  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:20):**  source of the organic residues being returned to the soil. Certainly if we don't have the  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:25):**  microbes there to decompose them or if there's not enough, there's not a diverse enough quantity  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:31):**  of organic substances to help build up soil organic matter, that will affect soil health  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:38):**  as well because like I mentioned before, organic matter is one of the key indicators for good  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:44):**  soil health. In our experience working with many different farms, I would say just off  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:50):**  the top of my head that greater than 90% of the farms that we work with experience severe  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:30:56):**  manganese deficiencies. And I have wondered about the long-term effects. When you have  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:04):**  glyphosate accumulation, you have this shift in the pessarium population and you have oxidizing  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:09):**  organisms that are immobilizing manganese. What are the long-term implications of that  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:16):**  manganese immobility in the soil profile? How long does it take before that manganese  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:21):**  might be released again and converted back into a form that the plants can actually utilize?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:27):**  Yes, that is a concern and I think there's several issues here. You have the effect on  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:39):**  the shift in the balance of the microbial diversity and if that's shifted towards a  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:46):**  lot of manganese oxidizers that is causing manganese not to be available. I think over  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:52):**  time if one were to offer the management to include let's say cover crops or at least  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:31:59):**  the different crops within the rotations and once you do that, you can stimulate other  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:04):**  types of microorganisms that will help free that manganese or at least compete with those  
**[0:32:11-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:11):**  oxidizers to reduce their impact on that. So that would be one possibility. The other  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:19):**  and how long that will take, it's hard to say. It may take a couple of seasons or maybe  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:26):**  less. That's something that really needs to be looked into. The other issue is something  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:32):**  that we mentioned previously is that how much manganese can be immobilized or chelated by  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:39):**  the residual glyphosate and residual AMPA. That I think is a very serious issue especially  
**[0:32:46-0:32:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:46):**  if we are in soils where the texture is such or the level of phosphorus in the soil is  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:32:58):**  low that you don't have any competition with the glyphosate and AMPA, they will obviously  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:05):**  chelate or immobilize manganese as well. I don't think we have any real good information  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:11):**  on how long that can happen or what the extent that situation is as far as tying up manganese  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:18):**  over the long term but I think taking all that together with the shift in the microbes,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:25):**  the residual glyphosate and the AMPA and the basically continuous corn-soybean rotation,  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:32):**  if that continues the manganese problem may persist.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:37):**  When you speak of growing crops in or bringing crops into a rotation to help reduce some  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:43):**  of that manganese and increase its availability, what are some crops that are really effective  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:49):**  at having a reducing effect and shifting the biology and the availability of manganese  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:55):**  in the soil profile?  
**[0:33:56-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:33:56):**  Well, I don't have any very specific ones but certainly when you have a diversity of  
**[0:34:04-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:04):**  let's say cover crops in a mix, there will be some that will either support different  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:14):**  local communities that are able to let's say mobilize these micronutrients, others that  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:20):**  can actually mobilize the nutrients themselves. A common example is the use of let's say buckwheat  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:28):**  that can or some of the brassica crops that can mobilize phosphorus or neutralize nitrates,  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:36):**  those types of things.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:37):**  And then let's say you bring in something like sorghum into the rotations, grain sorghum  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:42):**  or sweet sorghum, anything in that sorghum family, from my experience they have a keen  
**[0:34:48-0:34:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:48):**  ability to host a lot of mycorrhizal fungi in their root system. And of course mycorrhizae  
**[0:34:56-0:35:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:34:56):**  are very adept at mobilizing many nutrients, not just phosphorus. If you could put in a  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:06):**  crop like that or other crops that can host mycorrhizae, that would be a very good way  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:11):**  of maybe getting around the manganese problem and improving root growth as well as improving  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:20):**  the overall diversity of microbial community.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:22):**  One of the pieces you mentioned earlier was the impact of genetically modified plants  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:28):**  themselves outside of glyphosate and AMPA. How do GMOs impact the soil's microbial community?  
**[0:35:35-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:35):**  Well there's not a lot of information. We know that we found with soybean for example,  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:45):**  you have what happens during genetic modification, you can have some what's called pleiotrophic  
**[0:35:52-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:52):**  effects which are in other words indirect effects due to the genetic modification that  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:35:59):**  is additional to the intended effect. In other words, in addition to the effect of making  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:04):**  the plant resistant to glyphosate. And so there's things that can happen that we've  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:10):**  noticed in the root system with some of the early genetically modified soybean varieties  
**[0:36:16-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:16):**  anyway that even without being treated with glyphosate, the roots seem to release a lot  
**[0:36:24-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:24):**  more quantities of carbohydrates or soluble carbon and amino acids. And so this is problematic  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:33):**  because what that does, it attracts a lot of microbes that readily use this material  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:38):**  and many of those can be potential pathogens. So you have a potential problem with not only  
**[0:36:44-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:44):**  some root pathology but also it's possible to build up these segments of the microbial  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:52):**  population that can be carried over from year to year. Another situation where we find these  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:36:59):**  effects we noticed in corn but not in all corn varieties but in many varieties that  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:05):**  had been genetically modified to be resistant to insects using the BT gene, there would  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:11):**  be a side effect where some of the corn stalks would have a lot more lignin in it than others.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:18):**  Lignin is very difficult to decompose. That's one of the reasons why sometimes we see a  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:23):**  lot of that residue being carried over for two or three years in the field because so  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:30):**  much lignin, it can't be decomposed very fast. And I think there are other situations that  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:36):**  can occur. I mean there may be some modification that we found. I had a Brazilian student there  
**[0:37:44-0:37:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:44):**  that looked at some of the nutrient composition, some of the omega fatty acid ratios were changed  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:37:54):**  in soybean due to the genetic modification and that kind of thing. Now I can't say for  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:01):**  sure if that has changed with some of the more recent cultivars because I haven't really  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:06):**  been looking at that too closely over the last few years but as you know in our commodity  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:13):**  agriculture these varieties change almost from year to year and some of the varieties  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:17):**  that we were using let's say 15 years ago are not available anymore. So that's always  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:22):**  another problem. You just don't know whether the effects of these newer varieties are any  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:28):**  better or if they're any worse unless somebody has a research program that's addressing that.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:33):**  Your first point is very intriguing though. In essence what you're describing is that  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:37):**  these crops and these plants may have the capacity to actually develop a disease enhancing  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:43):**  soil profile which is interesting when you consider the long-term implications. Right.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:48):**  Yeah I mean that was a complete unexpected result that we had and we were comparing this  
**[0:38:54-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:38:54):**  to some of the old non-GMO varieties like Williams 82 or Maverick and these kinds of  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:02):**  things and they had much lower soluble carbon and amino acid release. So it was quite interesting  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:09):**  to say at least. What do you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other  
**[0:39:16-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:16):**  people don't believe to be true? Oh well it's you know there are a lot of issues. You know  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:25):**  we can kind of go back to this whole organic matter issue. We're seeing a lot of soils  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:31):**  under modern agriculture and we say that you know we talked about the intensive use of  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:37):**  chemical inputs and the GM crops and all that. You know we're seeing a depletion of soil  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:42):**  organic matter content in these fields. I've been tracking some fields for 30 years or  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:47):**  better and soils at one time had let's say 3% organic matter and now down to almost 1%.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:39:55):**  And I think a lot of folks will not you know kind of dismiss that like it isn't happening  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:02):**  but when you use you know intensive let's say nitrogen inputs like anhydrous ammonia  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:09):**  and all that and you're not putting in more organic residues whether it's from the crop  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:16):**  or with cover crops or organic amendments like manures and compost, that nitrogen has  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:22):**  to be used. If it's not all used by the crop, the microbes are going to use it and they  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:27):**  are going to use whatever carbon is available in the soil and I'm certain that's where a  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:32):**  lot of that depletion in the organic matter is happening. And you know there are some  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:37):**  real good studies over at the University of Illinois that have shown this and even they  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:41):**  were very much criticized by that. People didn't want to believe it and of course a  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:45):**  lot of it you know it comes down to money, it comes down to what the fertilizer companies  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:51):**  are trying to make money at that. If you tell them that some of their product is ruining  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:40:56):**  soil, some of the soil properties, that's not going to make them very happy.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:01):**  This idea of the soluble carbon component and the importance of the soluble carbon component  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:07):**  has come up in conversation a number of times recently and you've just expressed how we  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:12):**  are losing that. How can we regenerate that in the soil profile?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:17):**  Well you know again it all goes back to having plants and I think I've seen this on your  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:24):**  website, you know having a diversity of plants on the soil and having living roots in the  
**[0:41:30-0:41:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:30):**  soil for as long during the year as possible. You know when you can do that and harvest  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:38):**  as much carbon dioxide and use the sunlight to produce the carbohydrates in the plant  
**[0:41:44-0:41:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:44):**  and if you have a good profile that is inhabited by roots, you will get that soluble or labile  
**[0:41:55-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:41:55):**  carbon back and the reason that is is because many plants, well I should say all plants,  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:02):**  estimated depending on the plant, anywhere from 20 to maybe 50% of the carbon that is  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:07):**  fixed through photosynthesis will be released through roots by the plant and it's not because  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:13):**  the plant is compromised like with a disease or anything, it just naturally does that and  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:20):**  that carbon supports the microbial communities in the soil. So I think something just as  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:27):**  simple as mixing up that rotation, it's too bad that we don't grow as much wheat in the  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:33):**  Midwest like we used to, that would be an excellent way of doing that. You follow corn  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:39):**  or soybeans with wheat, you have wheat going into the winter, you can frost seed clovers  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:46):**  or lespedeza or whatever in with the wheat and then next spring and you have a nice cover  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:42:53):**  crop going into the next planting season, what better way to really get your soil revitalized  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:00):**  than doing something like that? Certainly the farmers that we have observed who are  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:05):**  developing strong cover crop systems such as Gabe Brown and Dave Brandt and others are  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:12):**  regenerating their soil carbon and their soil organic matter very rapidly and producing  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:17):**  some very nice crop results as well. So I believe there's a lot of potential. Exactly.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:24):**  What is a book or resource that you recommend most often to growers to learn more information  
**[0:43:30-0:43:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:30):**  about any of these various systems that we've talked about? Well, there are some around  
**[0:43:38-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:38):**  that are useful and are not that technical. The one on teeming with microbes is good.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:46):**  Is that a long one? Yes, that one I think is a good overview of what's going on in the  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:54):**  soil and describes what these different organisms are. I know he's got one called Teeming with  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:43:59):**  Fungi but I don't know if that's much more informative than just the first one that he  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:04):**  wrote on teeming with microbes. Another one that I found that is very interesting is one  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:10):**  called Mycorrhizal Plant. Are you familiar with that one? I'm not familiar with that  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:15):**  one. Pardon me? That is a new one for me. Yeah, well you can get it from acres and it's  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:23):**  really good. If you wanted to focus on the mycorrhizae and what they are, what they do  
**[0:44:27-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:27):**  and how to have those established in the soil, I think that's about as good as a, let's say  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:36):**  at the high school level I'd say as far as understanding what's going on. I think that's  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:42):**  a good one to have and it's reasonably priced. So those are two that with the standpoint  
**[0:44:48-0:44:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:48):**  of having a microbial emphasis is good. And then there are some others about, oh, whether  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:44:56):**  it's Save Our Soil or something like that, that would be good from a soil standpoint.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:00):**  I just don't have those titles at hand right now but certainly I could provide you a list  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:06):**  of what I have later. I would appreciate that and I will attach that list to the episode.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:13):**  Okay. What is the question you wish I would have asked? Yeah, that's a good one. Well,  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:24):**  I'm sure this is something that I'm sure you have encountered. I have also, one of the  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:29):**  things that I did mention of the many projects that I've had over the years is that I get  
**[0:45:35-0:45:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:35):**  asked to evaluate a lot of biological products. I don't know if a lot of the folks that you  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:46):**  work with have looked into these kinds of things but some of those are very interesting  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:52):**  and some of them I would not recommend at all. That kind of question I thought maybe  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:45:59):**  would come up. So of these various biological products, what are some of the ideas or the  
**[0:46:04-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:04):**  technologies that you're really excited about? Okay. Well, there are some that I think, okay,  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:13):**  I think we got maybe back up a minute. There are a lot of different classifications of  
**[0:46:18-0:46:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:18):**  biological products and I don't think anybody has really settled on anything that is set  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:25):**  in stone so to speak at this point. But there are things like biostimulants that help with  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:33):**  the microbial community activity as well as the plant especially in terms of root growth  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:39):**  and plant growth regulation. There are things that are called probiotic type biological  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:44):**  products and these have the actual living organisms in them and they are supposed to  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:49):**  be selected that help promote growth of plants and maybe help some of the soil functions  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:46:56):**  such as cyclone nitrogen and phosphorus and these kinds of things. Some claim to have  
**[0:47:01-0:47:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:01):**  nitrogen fixing bacteria in them but I haven't had much luck in showing that that actually  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:08):**  happens. And then there's another product, class of products known as prebiotic and there  
**[0:47:14-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:14):**  are quite a few of these out there. What a prebiotic is, is a solution or a product that  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:23):**  is made of the metabolites or the biochemical products of microorganisms but do not contain  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:31):**  living microorganisms. So you have that kind of thing and they're supposed to again, they  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:38):**  not only stimulate growth of the plant because I've seen the chromatographic spectrum of  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:44):**  one product and it shows there could be 300 different compounds in this thing. They don't  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:49):**  even know what they all are or what they all do but they do know that some of them stimulate  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:47:54):**  plant growth. Some of them are plant growth regulators like cytokinin and gibberellins  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:00):**  and all that and some of them stimulate the microbes in the soil. So here's the issue  
**[0:48:05-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:05):**  with all this is that most of these products, their effect or their efficacy is primarily  
**[0:48:15-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:15):**  based on testimonials. They haven't really been tested by unbiased parties. But there  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:26):**  are a few out there that have been tested like we've tested some and some have been  
**[0:48:31-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:31):**  tested by other either institutions or companies to show some effect. So I guess what I'm saying  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:38):**  is that those that I've looked at that work really well, I'm impressed with. Some of them  
**[0:48:45-0:48:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:45):**  have these specific plant growth regulators that really help with root growth. It helps  
**[0:48:53-0:49:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:48:53):**  with plant vigor and we find that they will also stimulate certain microbial groups in  
**[0:49:01-0:49:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:01):**  the root zones or rhizospheres of these crops. And of course, here's the other caveat to  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:09):**  all this. A lot of these companies will approach us and say they want to test their chemical  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:13):**  to see if they can offset the effects of glyphosate because they know there might be an angle  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:19):**  there that might make their product a little more valuable to the farmer because if they  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:24):**  can say, well, glyphosate has these detrimental effects that have these side effects but our  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:29):**  product can counteract that, well, that makes that product even more valuable. So in some  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:36):**  cases, we've been able to show that. Some of these products we tested for more than  
**[0:49:41-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:41):**  two or three or four years, we consistently see that there is an offset. But the biggest  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:48):**  issue I've had is that some of these products will do all that. Will even actually help  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:54):**  the soil health indicators and help plant growth. But then at the end of the day, at  
**[0:49:58-0:50:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:49:58):**  the end of the season, we don't see that much increase in yield. And I think that's the  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:02):**  bottom line with these products is that if you're going to sell or buy these, you want  
**[0:50:07-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:07):**  to have enough of a yield increase that will pay for the product. A few years ago when  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:15):**  we had higher prices for corn, there were a lot of people using these things. Right  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:20):**  now, not so much. But I do believe that some out there that are worth the money because  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:25):**  I've seen how they work. And I think that they not only help the current crop, but I  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:30):**  think they help offset some of the detrimental effects that has happened to the overall soil  
**[0:50:35-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:35):**  community due to some of the modern agricultural techniques that we're using.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:40):**  We use these various, we use a number of different bio stimulants and probiotics, microbial inoculants  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:48):**  in the crop programs that we put together. And as we have tested many different products  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:54):**  from different companies over the years, one of the biggest challenges that we have observed  
**[0:50:59-0:51:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:50:59):**  is, and of course, looking at things on a field scale and not always that they're not  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:05):**  usually replicated to trials. But one of the challenges that we've observed is the inconsistency  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:11):**  of results where we might have a product that produces extraordinary results, perhaps let's  
**[0:51:17-0:51:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:17):**  say 30 or 40% of the time. So it works really well sometimes, but it doesn't work consistently.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:24):**  And it's, that's been a very interesting observation because it happens and has happened, has occurred  
**[0:51:30-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:30):**  with quite a number of products, which has led me to ask the question or to wonder whether  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:36):**  there is also an environmental component of what is happening in the soil profile, what's  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:43):**  happening in that field, and do we really have the right conditions where we're giving  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:48):**  an inoculant or a probiotic the opportunity for success?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:51):**  No, I think you're right on onto something there, John, because that's what I try to  
**[0:51:59-0:52:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:51:59):**  indicate to the manufacturers when we test these products here, because we're seeing  
**[0:52:05-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:05):**  the same deal. That's why I wouldn't make any conclusions on what we've seen on just  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:12):**  one year data. We've got to have at least two or three years. And even at that, sometimes  
**[0:52:17-0:52:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:17):**  we do have the same positive yields. And the very thing that you mentioned about the other  
**[0:52:28-0:52:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:28):**  factors that enter into this as far as the performance of these products, that point  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:34):**  is well taken. And I say that because we're located in a part of the state that doesn't  
**[0:52:40-0:52:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:40):**  have the best soils for producing corn and soybean. I mean, it has this clay pan. Conditions  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:47):**  have to be just perfect in order to get a very good and acceptable harvest from year  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:52:54):**  to year. So I think we're testing some of these products under conditions from the standpoint  
**[0:53:00-0:53:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:00):**  of soils that is pretty rigorous. And if we take this and do it, say, in some of the molestalls  
**[0:53:10-0:53:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:10):**  or the high organic or more fertile soils in the upper Midwest, we might see something  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:17):**  completely different. So I think these companies, I know that they are not as flush as some  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:24):**  of the big ag chemical companies, but they really want to show how these products perform.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:29):**  They need to be doing this in different regions of the country or even internationally in  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:35):**  order to really show how these products perform.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:39):**  Absolutely. What is the one action that you would recommend that growers need to take?  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:44):**  Growers from the standpoint of growers under any situation or any system.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:51):**  Just in general?  
**[0:53:53-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:53:53):**  Yeah, in general. Well, here's the deal, I think. We look at some of the principles of  
**[0:54:02-0:54:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:02):**  sustainable agriculture. One of them is we've got to keep the soil covered. And that doesn't  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:08):**  necessarily mean that we have to have cover crops on it. But we've got to have, after  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:13):**  harvest, that soil needs to be covered because if it's bare or if there's not much covered  
**[0:54:20-0:54:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:20):**  with the residue, it is exposed to the elements. There's hardly any restoration of moisture  
**[0:54:29-0:54:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:29):**  in there if it's bare. I think that is a key. And then, of course, keeping living plants  
**[0:54:36-0:54:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:36):**  on that soil is even better yet because we get that organic matter built up, it will  
**[0:54:44-0:54:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:44):**  absorb more soil, you won't have a lot of erosion, and infiltration will be more regulated.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:51):**  And I think those are keys. I had to say one thing to produce. There is one thing, if we  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:54:59):**  have a little time, one thing that we didn't mention, and this is a practice that we used  
**[0:55:04-0:55:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:04):**  to do, let's say 50, 40 years ago, was to integrate livestock in with the cropping system.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:11):**  I believe that if we could run livestock, again, out on the fields, and I know it's  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:16):**  not going to happen, but maybe for family farmers it can, and we can have livestock  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:22):**  out there that helps process the residues or even graze cover crops and recycle some  
**[0:55:28-0:55:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:28):**  of the organic matter, stimulate the root growth by grazing. I think that's a great  
**[0:55:33-0:55:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:33):**  practice that we have pretty much forgotten about.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:38):**  That's a very interesting comment, Robert, because that's come up in a number of conversations  
**[0:55:42-0:55:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:42):**  recently about the impact that livestock can have on rebuilding soil organic matter and  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:50):**  kind of rebuilding the entire ecosystem to a much higher plateau, a much higher state  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:55:55):**  of health and overall vitality and performance. So, I guess the question I would have for  
**[0:56:01-0:56:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:01):**  you is that there's been some discussion that perhaps the economics of beef production,  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:10):**  if we were to look, if we were to manage our livestock, and more specifically, if we were  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:14):**  to manage forages with the same level of intensity that we manage some of our other crops, the  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:20):**  economics may actually be there to out-compete and to outperform current commodity crops,  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:26):**  particularly with commodity crop prices, such as corn prices being where they are right  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:30):**  now. So, do you have any insights to offer on that? What are the economic implications  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:35):**  of managing grazing very closely and very carefully compared to current commodity crops?  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:41):**  Oh, yeah, that's a good question. I don't have a whole lot of insight into that, but  
**[0:56:46-0:56:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:46):**  just knowing in isolated situations where, well, your example of Gabe Brown is perfect  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:56:56):**  for this because they've got the system where they integrate their grazing herds into their  
**[0:57:03-0:57:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:03):**  forages that is then rotated eventually into row crops, as I understand it. So, the economics,  
**[0:57:11-0:57:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:11):**  I think, would be there. And of course, this is a bias. I believe the more exposure you  
**[0:57:21-0:57:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:21):**  have for livestock that are grazing, that are not confined, that meat quality is going  
**[0:57:28-0:57:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:28):**  to be so much better than what you find from a feeding floor. I think if one would push  
**[0:57:35-0:57:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:35):**  the pencil on that, I believe you would find that the overall profits in a system that  
**[0:57:40-0:57:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:40):**  would very much outweigh the way we are doing commodity crops currently. To me, commodity  
**[0:57:47-0:57:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:47):**  crops are just, it's just emphasized a little bit too much. It's for the commodity market,  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:57:57):**  for exports, for biofuels and all that. Very little of it goes to feed, although a lot  
**[0:58:02-0:58:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:02):**  of soybean meal go to feed, but for livestock feed. But we've really gotten away from what  
**[0:58:09-0:58:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:09):**  an agro-ecosystem should be. I think when the family farmer or the smaller scale farmer  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:22):**  had livestock integrated into the system, the profitability was there. It's just that  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:27):**  it's been hijacked by industry. I think that's the bottom line. Now, if there were a way  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:34):**  to turn that corner and bring some of that back, I believe a lot of folks would be surprised  
**[0:58:40-0:58:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:40):**  how profitable that would be. But unfortunately, I can't give you any solid figures at this  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:45):**  point.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:46):**  That's okay. Robert, it's been a tremendous honor to have you here on the podcast and  
**[0:58:51-0:58:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:51):**  sharing your thoughts. Thank you very much. We look forward to having you back at some  
**[0:58:56-0:58:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:56):**  point in the future. Thank you for sharing.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:58:57):**  All right, John. It's been my pleasure. I've enjoyed visiting with you. I hope that this  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:03):**  little information will be useful to your listeners.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:06):**  Thank you.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:07):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:12):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AA, we believe in challenging the  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:18):**  status quo to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops. We also believe that healthy  
**[0:59:23-0:59:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:23):**  plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants, we must first  
**[0:59:29-0:59:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:29):**  think differently about agriculture, about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:34):**  about regeneration versus degeneration. To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:40):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield with less risk of crop failure. In short,  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/increasing-biological-populations-with-robert-kremer/#t=0:59:45):**  we help growers make more money with less risk. If you aren't yet an AA customer, go

**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  regenerate plant health, soil health, and of course, ultimately public health,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:14):**  as well as ecosystem health.

**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:19):**  who is a sixth generation farmer from California, which is arguably one of  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:24):**  the most intensive production regions of agricultural productions around the globe.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  So, Kenan, thank you very much for joining us and  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  for being willing to share your wisdom and insights.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  I'd love to hear about your story and background.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  What is the context of agricultural production and  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  your farming operation in California and the context of your interest in  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  new innovations and looking at agriculture differently for the future?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  Yeah, thanks John and thanks for having me and I really appreciate all that you do  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  educating and your podcast and all the information that you've got out there is  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:01):**  really helpful and for furthering the discussion, I think you're doing a great  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  job and it's much appreciated.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  For me personally, like you said, sixth generation family farm here in  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:11):**  the Central Valley might be just a little different than kind of how some families  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  have had a history just in terms of not all of us have grown up on the farm.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  It sort of, it stemmed from my third great grandfather coming over in the 1850s and  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:26):**  got into cattle raising and kind of a vertically integrated cattle model that he  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  really did amazingly well, it's a kind of American dream type story really,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  and was a real innovator.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  That being said, he was a very type A person who kind of kept things close to  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:42):**  the vest, didn't like to have people, even family, bothering him about it.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  And so his offspring got the benefits of a successful business but  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:50):**  weren't really kind of nurtured in the sense that people think of maybe where you  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  grow up on the farm and you live the whole, you know, the kind of bucolic  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  overalls and lifestyle.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  So again, I think people have that conception of what every, you know,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  every farm is fairly similar.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  As you and I know, there can be vast differences.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  So for us, you know, just also through a chain of events, the farm sort of  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  fragmented in the 1960s between two family groups that were kind of dividing.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  So some people came into agriculture kind of like almost later just in terms  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:19):**  of having to run a business that sort of went through some turmoil in terms of  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  family changes.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:24):**  So, you know, it does to me also indicate how important succession planning for  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  agriculture is and how, you know, if you want to be a successful long-term family  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:33):**  business, you've got to plan for, you know, next generations to be involved.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  And so that's something my ancestor didn't do well.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  He did a lot of things well.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  He didn't do that well.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:41):**  And so we kind of paid the price for that.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  So anyway, fast forward, I grew up in the Bay Area.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  I actually grew up in San Francisco proper.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  So the trips that I took with my grandfather to the farm were just this kind of  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  amazing wonder, you know, wondrous place where you had a lot of freedom.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  And so I always had a really strong affinity for it and attachment to it.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  But again, the family was used to sort of having managers run the operation with  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  oversight from family versus like the family member being all the time on the  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  farm.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  And so when I was going through college and things, I just didn't have, there  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:13):**  wasn't a spot for me really going to be on the farm.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  So I got into commercial real estate, started a whole different career.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  But then again, through some changes, it was decided that I could come back and  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  help when one of the relatives got sick, who was taking care of the farm.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  So I came back in 1998 after being away for a while and then decided to live full  
**[0:03:35-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  time on the farm.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  So I've raised my sons on the farm and have, again, sort of kind of maybe  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  reestablished a little more of a connection from a family standpoint.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  But California, like you alluded to, is a very rigorous business climate for  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:48):**  everybody in terms of regulation and cost of production and those types of things.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  So when I first got to the farm, we were just growing three primary crops, which  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  were cotton, barley, and alfalfa.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  Those are sort of these bulk type crops that don't have much specialization,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  really.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  So over time, we've really changed in the last decade, last 15 years has been  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  accelerated a change to multiple different crops, to organic and  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  conventional farming methods, more mainly a vegetable crop farm now.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  We do still grow some extra long staple cotton, which is a specialized niche  
**[0:04:23-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  cotton.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  But then we do mostly processing tomatoes and fresh tomatoes, watermelons, garlic,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  onions, carrots, herbs like basil, cilantro, oregano, and again, organic and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  conventional sides of that.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:37):**  Farmers are really stewards.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  No matter where you are, you're sort of a steward of resources all the time.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  And so for us, like the water, California, because of the climate, we're 100%  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  irrigated agriculture, not really reliant on any rainfall.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  Water is an input that we pay, the money we pay funds the water district.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  So water is an input, any input that we have, it's a cost.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:59):**  And so we just have always, you don't want to use more of anything than you have to.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:02):**  And I think sometimes people don't give farmers the credit for some of that.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  And I know there's some agricultural practices where people maybe aren't as  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  informed or have a lower cost structure.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  But for us, it's just one of those things like we don't have to spray something.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  We don't.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  If overusing water doesn't help a crop, it actually hurts your crop.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  We're trying to tailor every single input to be as exact as possible.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:23):**  So I've always had an interest in the technology side, looking at satellite  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  imagery, variable rate applications, those types of things.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  And so I think the next big frontier is kind of where you're been centered in,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:36):**  which is these regenerative techniques and how to improve soil health and those things.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  And that's not to say that we haven't been doing that.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  You know, I guess we've been farming this same piece of land.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  Some of the land was sold as the farm got divided, but we've been farming  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  this exact piece of land for over 160 years.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  So I guess when I hear people saying, you know, like,  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  we're going to teach you about how to be sustainable and how to be around,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  I kind of laugh a little bit, but not that we can't learn more.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  Like I'm always open to learning more again.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  Like we'll get into some more of the details, but I'll stop there.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  I'll keep going on forever.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:08):**  So but anyway, can you give us some context  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  on the scope and scale of your farming operation in the region?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  We talk about California, but California is a significant geographic area.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:19):**  Which part of California are you in?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  And what's the general scope of your operation  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  just to offer some context for the farmers who are listening?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  Absolutely. And context, especially in the regenerative discussion,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  I think is really important.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  So we are located really if you took a pin and put it  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:34):**  kind of right in the center of the Central Valley of California,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  we are kind of in that area.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  We're in what they would call the Central Valley,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  which is comprised of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  We're in the San Joaquin Valley, which would be just an indicator  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:48):**  of the river system that is kind of the largest going through this area.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  The little town that is nearest is a town called Los Banos.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  We're about two and a half hours south of San Francisco  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  and about four hours north of L.A.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:00):**  Yeah, sort of small town.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  Not many people would know it, but sort of west side of the valley.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  We farm about 11,000 acres.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  Again, it's all irrigated.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  The farming company owns about 4,000 acres  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  and then we lease from others about 7,000 of those acres.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  So also something that people need to take into consideration is,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:20):**  you know, the practices that you would do on a lease piece of ground might be different.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  You know, depending on the timing of your lease  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  and how much control you think you have over that piece of ground,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  you may not implement certain practices.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  So that's kind of another nuance that I don't think people maybe talk about  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  when they're talking about what farmers should be doing or transitioning or kind of doing.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  So a lot of us do lease ground and have that kind of relationship.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  Some is family lease ground, some is from institutional investors  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  that have come into the area.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  So, yeah, so again, mostly irrigated.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  We're about seven or all irrigated.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:51):**  70% of the ground has drip irrigation infrastructure installed.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:55):**  We have solar systems in place to offset the cost of the electricity that we use.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  Then we also manage 650 acres of wetland habitat.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  We sit in a really interesting ecological area,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  which we're adjacent to the second largest contiguous wetlands in the United States,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:11):**  which is the grasslands wildlife management area.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  So really a really diverse ecosystem,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:16):**  really a crucial piece of the Pacific flyway for the migrating birds.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  And we, again, like I said, we maintain our own 650 acres of wetland habitat  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  and then have a number of different riparian corridors  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  that we've restored throughout the farm as well.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  So which leads to complexities with food safety  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  as we've transitioned to crops that have a food safety component.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  I think that's another thing people don't think about  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  is people say we want biodiversity and all these things.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  But then as you get into the complexities of food safety audits  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:43):**  and the concerns of large retailers,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  some of them are maybe unfounded in terms of the intensity  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  and the scrutiny that we're put under.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  But again, having the biodiversity in some instances  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  can be a real hindrance for us.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:57):**  Anyway, a unique spot to be farming  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:59):**  and proud that we can continue the tradition that God started a long time ago.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:04):**  That does sound like an interesting geological context or ecological context.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  You alluded to in your background description  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  of the intense regulatory environment that you find yourself in farming in California.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  I've had this interesting observation  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  where when we look at innovations in the agricultural space,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  innovations in the areas of technology or just in general acceptance  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  or embracing new ideas and new technologies,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:32):**  I see the embracing of new technologies and new ideas  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  coming from people who are kind of at the opposite ends of the spectrum.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  One of the spectrum you have, let's say, a country such as Australia,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  which has minimal farm supports.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:45):**  You could even say in some cases almost no farm support.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  As a result of this very open regulatory environment  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  and very little support from a subsidy perspective or insurance perspective,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  there is very intense innovation and adoption of new innovations.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:03):**  On the other hand, you have an environment such as California  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:07):**  with intense regulatory scrutiny.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  Yet it seems, and of course, I'm using a very broad brushstroke,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  everyone is an individual,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:16):**  but it seems that the California producers in general  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  tend to be more innovative than they are in other parts of North America.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:22):**  Do you have any thoughts or insights as to, first of all,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  if that is actually the case from your perspective and what might lead to that?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  Like I said in the beginning, I think that with the pressures on our costs,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:33):**  because California really wants to be the leader in workers' rights  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:37):**  and protections, all things that are good and environmental rights and protections,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  but it's just difficult.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:42):**  We get put in a difficult spot because the rest of the world  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:45):**  isn't necessarily feeling as progressive as California is.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:49):**  We have a very high minimum wage, we pay our farmers overtime,  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  our farm workers, but we again have a lot of environmental regulations and other things.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:00):**  Again, I think it goes back to just trying to figure out how to be as competitive as possible.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  I think that leads people to think about things like technology.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:08):**  I know robotics and all those things,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  automation is really coming into California  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  because of the pressure on the high cost of each worker now is just sort of accelerating.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  Again, every farmer is different and every farm kind of setup is very different  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:23):**  than how they approach things, but in the long run for California,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  I think it's got to be the folks who are on some of that cutting edge.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  I will say it is hard, and especially when you're talking about practice changes,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  most farmers are doing what they're doing because it's worked for them already  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  and so they kind of have a comfort level with a program that seems to be working.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  Not that that can't be changed, but also when you're dealing with a low margin time,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:47):**  it's very hard to say let's look at adopting either new technology or new practices  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:53):**  because people want to feel that that practice change is really going to be something  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:58):**  that does what it says it's going to do and does apply properly to their area and their region.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  So I think you get caught a little bit with some of the slower adoption of things  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  because you want to be on the leading edge but not on the bleeding edge  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  and try to figure out what makes sense for each operation.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  So I think the best thing that gets success and adoption is seeing success  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  or seeing a demonstrable return on investment.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  A lot of the discussion right now, at least on the regenerative side,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  there's really great ideas and good information starting to be produced.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  Again, it's coming from sometimes specific regions that wouldn't apply to the different spots that you're in.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:37):**  So I think it's interesting, again, it's also a philosophy thing I think with guys too,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  how they want to approach and with newer generations and younger people coming in,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:45):**  I think there's also going to be new ideas just all over the place.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:48):**  There are many people within the space of organic agriculture, regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  whatever term you want to use, and those are not necessarily interchangeable, I understand,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:58):**  but people who have that paradigm, if you will, who express a desire for a variety of reasons  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  to develop an agriculture that is more regionalized, more decentralized,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  and provides more of an opportunity for smaller and mid-scale operations.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  When we look at the regulatory climate that exists in California  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  and is likely to spread to other places over time,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  and we look at the increased adoption of robotics,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:30):**  how realistic does that ideal vision of the future appear to be to you?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  Yeah, and I guess I don't know who that's ideal to.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  You do hear the construct of big ag or corporate ag.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:45):**  I think there's an aversion at some level for people to want to think of agriculture  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  and sort of those terminologies.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  I think of the smaller farmers, and I think agriculture is better for it  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  to have a wide spectrum of operations that are out there.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:02):**  I think you have to make a nod to the fact that whether we like it or not today,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:08):**  conventional agriculture is feeding the majority of the planet,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  and that's, again, not to say that we shouldn't get to new systems,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  but I think we have the ability to have that discussion  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  because we have a very stable food system, at least in certain countries don't have that,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  and I think in that case they're probably not saying,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  oh, we need a big shift to organic.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  They're saying, well, you just need food to come in every day.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  I think we in the first world are now saying, hey, we can do better than what we're doing,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  and I think that's great, and I think that's the kind of thing that should happen.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:38):**  I will say, like in California, what we're seeing, again,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:41):**  I think there's examples of small farms that are doing really well  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  and that are close, like a model that would be close to a city,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  and they're getting their CSA boxes and they're doing interesting kind of community connected,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  more of that, and I think there's good opportunities there,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:56):**  but I think that doesn't necessarily resolve that there's just a lot of food that needs to get out  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  and also needs to be relatively affordable,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  and I would guess the farmers markets that I've walked in places like San Francisco and things,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  you're not generally seeing the average person working from paycheck to paycheck accessing that resource,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  so I think you need to keep in mind that there's a lot of people that are eating from the center of the store  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  because it's cheap and whatever, but we still, like, healthy options that are grown responsibly,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  I still think need to be offered to the widest variety of people possible from the healthcare,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:33):**  and so there's a lot of complexities in just saying we want a lot of smaller disaggregated farms,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  and the big farms, to be honest, I mean, a lot of us are able to, and we're not a big,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  I mean, we're a big farm but not big by, I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of acre farms,  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  you know, 100,000 plus acre farms in California.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:49):**  We have a scholarship program for our workers' kids.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  We were offering healthcare before other people were doing it.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  We have a defined benefit pension plan.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  You know, there's things that a large operation can do also that aren't bad.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:00):**  I mean, so I guess I also want to get away from, like, and also what is big and what is small and what is good,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  and some of these things are just easy to try to do it,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:09):**  but I think one thing about the regulatory pressures is that a lot of guys just who are, we have an aging,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  if you look at the census data, we do have, we have an aging ag population.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  A lot of these guys are just kind of throwing up their hands saying, you know, I can't do a nitrogen management plan.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  I can't, like, I don't want to learn how to do drip irrigation because it's, you know,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  I don't want to install solar systems to offset the cost of putting in the drip.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:31):**  There's just a lot of things that they're saying, like, that we have to keep all these small guys.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:35):**  I mean, they want to be around, I think, but then a lot of their kids don't want to get into it either,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:39):**  just because they might see the writing on the wall.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  So, again, there's a lot of shifts that are happening.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:43):**  We're seeing a lot of consolidation in California as, like, investor groups are coming in and offering money that is,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  you know, larger than what most of these, you know, small guys are happy to say, let's just get out of it and go on.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  So I'm not saying that's ideal.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  Again, like I said, I like the fabric of our neighborhood here where, you know, the average size is about 400 acres per farm,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  and we've got Basque and Portuguese and Italian and these great heritages here and kind of a richness that, you know,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:09):**  I don't want to see go away.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  But, again, the pressures are becoming to where it seems like a lot of consolidation is going to continue to happen.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  And I think you raise very good questions and very good points about what is an appropriate size.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  An appropriate size and appropriate scale means different things in different regulatory climates,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  in different ecological ecosystems, in different crop contexts.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:31):**  I think it's important in all these conversations to not let the ideological escape the practical,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  which can easily happen if we don't have farmers engaging in the conversation and actually bringing a grounding reality to the discussion.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  As you've come from a background, you've obviously been exposed to agriculture all your life,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  but you came from perhaps a fresh perspective outside of agriculture.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  In your experience over the last couple of decades and looking at the agricultural landscape,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  what do you believe to be true about agriculture that is perhaps different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  Yeah, I definitely think it has to go along the lines with the farmers just being very responsible people that are doing,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:13):**  you know, the best thing that they know at the time.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:16):**  And, again, it is hard to contemplate. It's hard to contemplate big shifts in your operation.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  And, you know, I just feel like there is a narrative out there that just kind of oversimplifies what farming is.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:28):**  You know, like I think even you see like Michael Bloomberg saying you put a seed in the ground and it's just going to come up  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:33):**  and that's all we do is sit around and wait for that to happen.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:35):**  But, you know, I've had executives here in our office and given a PowerPoint a couple of years ago,  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  and this was from a guy from Costco, top level guys.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  And one of the guys at a break after I'd done a PowerPoint about the farm and what we were doing,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  he said, wow, you guys really run this place like a business.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:51):**  And I looked at him, what the heck does that mean?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  I mean, I was supposed to be like my donkeys outside and I'm sitting here.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  I mean, I don't know. I think there's misconceptions about how intense the life is and really I think regardless of scale.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  And so I think we're good. I think people are doing the best that they know how.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  And there's also a bandwidth issue, you know, for people to be able to take on, you know,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:14):**  like an infinite number of processes and new processes.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  And so I think, you know, again, I think it's a misunder, a misconnection.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:22):**  I think the connection that's been lost between the eating and the general public in the urban areas  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  and kind of the expectations of what we have for our farmers and the reality of how much it takes to put food on the table.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:34):**  I think farmers can do a better job trying to tell their stories, but we need, you know,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:38):**  partnerships with the brands and other folks to help us get the word out.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  But yeah, I just think it's that oversimplification probably is one of the biggest things that we get hit with.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:47):**  But the fact that, you know, the core goal of a farmer is to be productive.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:51):**  I mean, you know, there's some the idea that we are trying to like poison our soil or poison our workers or, you know,  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  that just that just runs contrary to every farmer I've ever talked to is, you know,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:02):**  maybe they aren't doing the best for their soil and maybe they don't just know exactly how.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  But I mean, they are also I mean, you know, the market weeds out the inefficient and the bad.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, if you're poisoning your soil consistently, you're eventually not going to be around.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:18):**  I mean, I think unfortunately, we've had some programs for some of the big program crops that support,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  you know, support operations that maybe shouldn't, you know,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  the need to make transitions and are making it more like where there isn't as much incentive to make the transitions.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  So I see that, but I don't see that in California because we just don't have access to the same types of programs that a lot of the big commodities have.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:39):**  I think our safety net is different than the safety net of some others.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:42):**  I think most farmers are innovators or problem solvers. I mean, you know, whether they're it's a good group of folks.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  Given the landscape that exists in the farming community,  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  the regulatory landscape, given the landscape of consumer demand and consumer misperceptions that you spoke about just a moment ago,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  where do you see the significant opportunities for grower in the future?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  Yeah, I think encouraging the connections with the with the again, you need a brand partner because the farmer himself.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  I mean, we've got social media and the things that we're doing.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  But I think listening to the consumer and trying to understand the trends of where people are wanting things to go is really important in getting good partnerships.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  I mean, to me, it's all about all about showing agriculture as a we're providing food, which is valuable.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:29):**  But I think we want to be a resource for the carbon sequestration solving problems for the larger community.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:35):**  I think adds not only to the value of the food production,  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  but also just connecting people with the idea that farms can be a problem solving entity for them.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  And I think we can help with the discussion about climate change and we can improve practices and use less resources,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:53):**  which then can mean more, maybe more resources. California is very water stressed.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  So as farms find ways to improve soil health and retain more water,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  that water can then flow to additional water for community security and for other environmental uses and things like that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  So, again, it's looking at it as a kind of more holistic system versus just looking at farmer versus urban versus environment.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  How do we make it like we're all how do we link together in a better way?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:19):**  And I think there's growing interest. I mean, you know, you're seeing documentaries now about the regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:26):**  You're seeing a lot of interest and people kind of getting excited about it, which is which is great.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  But I think we just also need to put the hard data along with it to make sure that any claims that are being made are also credible.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  And, you know, I think we want to give people the ability to access with their dollars to reward the right behavior.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  But it has to be credible in the way that we do that.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  I have two kind of associated questions based on your response just now.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:52):**  The the one question is, when we consider all of the narratives which are becoming more popular around regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  it is really kind of having its moment in the sun right now over the last couple of years in particular.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  And it seems to be growing at least in the popular press, popular awareness.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:11):**  You could say it hasn't particularly gained the same degree of awareness in the agricultural community.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  I would say in my perception, at least. Well, for awareness, perhaps, but not actual execution implementation.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  There's that lag there because of the challenges that you addressed earlier of people having a difficult time contemplating,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:32):**  adding in a bunch of additional pieces to what they are already doing with that context.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:36):**  My two questions are from your perspective, as you look at this whole landscape,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  what would have to happen to have these regenerative agriculture practices, whatever that might mean,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  become more widely adopted generally by growers?  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  And the second part of maybe should be the first part of that question to add context is what are you doing on your operation currently?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  Or how has your operation evolved over the last several years or decade or whatever timeframe to include more regenerative type practices?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:08):**  Yeah, it's funny. My answer to this is probably totally on the other sides of the spectrum, what might make sense.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  But I think on the one hand, you've got a lot of people interested in the space, like to the point that you made,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  but there isn't quite the data yet to back up some of what maybe is the exciting or what people think is the exciting part of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  So, you see a lot about cover crops just as an example.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  So I guess I would say that there's good data emerging that show that cover crops can be beneficial.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:36):**  But yet then there's some on the other side, there's some that would maybe say like, well, maybe you're depleting some of the carbon below lower than,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  you know, good from them, maybe just purely agronomic.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  But then on the carbon sequestration side, maybe the jury's still out on how that works.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  And I think there's also some maybe where it works, like if it works well in California, does it work well in California cover crops or are there other options?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  But so I guess just to get beyond all that, I would just say if a brand, let's say, decided we want all our wheat to come off of land that's had a cover crop before,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  or whatever the product is, I think before the science is finally finalized, you know, if brands want to say they're participating,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:16):**  and there's big brands and people out there that are wanting to make some connection to this regenerative movement,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  and maybe it's only fleeting, but I don't think so.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  But I would say those brands and people need to sort of decide, you know, what are the things that like they want to drive in some ways,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  because in a lot of ways, they're the ones who are going to pay, and they're the ones who are going to translate the story to the consumer.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  So, you know, if it is, let's just say it's that cover crop example, well, you know, somebody came to me and said, look, we'll pay you 20 bucks a ton more for whatever crop it is,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  as long as it's coming after, you know, these set of practices.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  And at least me as a farmer, I could sit back and I could go, okay, well, you know, the cover crop and the planting and termination and all these operations to do it are going to cost me X,  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:00):**  but, you know, I feel like my yield might go up, or at least if it's, I could do a model in that way, you know, to say like, look, I can adopt these practices,  
**[0:26:08-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  and I can actually then make more money. But we don't see that as much, you know, we don't see like somebody willing to commit to like that extra, you know, economic incentive to say,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  I did it and it worked and my neighbor then saw, hey, Canon's getting 20 bucks a ton more for his wheat and he's doing X, Y and Z, I want a part of that contract.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  I think then you'd see much wider adoption more quickly. And then on the far other side of that, I still think there's a lot of value on doing the on-farm projects,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  but doing it with research partners where you're actually coming up with the credible data that could back up either a carbon market or could back up, you know, that like this is demonstrably better yield,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:46):**  but that has to happen over multiple years. So I guess there's like the push and pull of saying like, you know, if the market's demanding certain amounts of things to happen or certain types of practices that we think are good today,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  like let's reward that and let, you know, the jury can be out for a little while and not to say we don't do that without some science, but then on the far side of that, like there's part of me that goes,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  well, I don't want to start doing all this stuff until I know, you know, just because somebody in Iowa said that they did this special rotation for two years and gets, you know, you see all these things of like the yield is, and like, you know, and they're,  
**[0:27:20-0:27:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  anyway, I just want to make sure that I just see value in both sides of that. I see potential. And, you know, I think we've got to back everything up with data is how I, every project we do on the farm, to your question about what we do on the farm,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:32):**  we don't do any project that isn't related to some academic institution that is wanting to do the research and be a third party.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:40):**  So it isn't just me as as can and the farmer saying, look, hey, I'm doubled my organic matter and I'm retaining all this.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:47):**  I want somebody else to say this is what these guys are doing and here's the results. And, you know, we're going to collaborate.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  But everything we've done has been with a grant like Healthy Soils Demonstration Project we had on the farm.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:58):**  We're doing some crushed the salt rock trials with the John Muir Institute from UC Davis.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:04):**  We've got CSU Chico on the farm this next year doing a regenerative cotton lint project that we've got going.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  So it's like I think there's multiple ways to kind of solve it, but it's kind of how we're trying to how we're trying to get there.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  I really enjoy I really enjoy your answer to that to those questions, Canon.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  I'll offer my some brief thoughts on on carbon. I think pricing carbon and developing a viable carbon marketplace that is actually going to benefit growers has yet to be done.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  There's obviously people who are pioneering and who are hoping to create something that's viable.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  But I haven't seen something that has really pushed my buttons yet.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:43):**  Like you, I am very much a champion of the idea that you achieve what you incentivize.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  If you want to achieve certain outcomes, you need to incentivize those outcomes economically, particularly in the agricultural community,  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  because in one sense, there is this sense that we have had for the last eight or nine decades.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  We've had a very strong and cheap food policy here in North America in particular.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  And I think many places around the world, but particularly here in North America.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  And that cheap food policy, of course, has put a lot of financial and economic pressure on producers themselves.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  But there is an aspect of this conversation around regenerative agriculture where farmers are being indicted as being the source of the challenge,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  the source of the problem, and being asked to change practices to to clean up their act and clean up the problem,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  but to do so without being compensated for it when they, in fact, were kind of backed into that corner in the first place as a result of cheap food policies  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:48):**  and not having the economic margins to do a job differently than in a way that they may have desired to do it more.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  So I am in complete agreement with the idea that there is some relatively large food companies right now who have made commitments to support the adoption of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  But it takes more to scale the adoption of regenerative agriculture than making a token commitment to a nonprofit organization to educate producers on how to do their job better.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  Yep, I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more. Economics drive it and the subsidization and the stuff that we've encouraged.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:20):**  We've reaped what we've sowed as a simple way to call it. But I mean, we it's been poor policy and encouraging the wrong type of behavior.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  But, you know, it's not because farmers are bad people. It's because, you know, they've had the wrong wrong messaging and maybe some wrong leadership, I think, out there.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:37):**  So and you'll see the quickest, absolutely the quickest changes if a guy is looking over the fence and seeing a guy getting 20 bucks a ton or whatever the number is.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  I mean, you know, that's how guys move and, you know, guys driving a shiny new red pickup and going, hey, how did Joe get, you know, what's Joe doing?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  I mean, that's why we that's we all are looking at each other all the time, whether we want to admit it or not.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  And those with success, you know, success breeds success to the perfect example of that is an earlier podcast interview I did with Robert Quinn from Montana who developed the markets for an ancient grain that they branded as commute and went from a few hundred acres to over 300000 acres with great deals of that being exported in a relatively short timeframe.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  And the foundational reason for that rapid growth in production and 300000 acres, the total wheat production is still just a drop in the bucket, but it grew very rapidly.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  And the reason for that was because they're offering farmers about 50 percent premium over typical organic prices, not even counting conventional prices.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  And so, of course, everyone wants to grow commute.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  That's straightforward.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  Yeah, it works pretty simply.  
**[0:31:51-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  It's difficult for us to contemplate making a lot of changes or even making a couple of changes because our operations and management is fairly intensive.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  There's always lots of things happening going on in any farming operation.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  What do you believe most limits farmers from achieving the potential that they're really capable of?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:12):**  Yeah, I think a lot of it is just the bandwidth.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  You know, it's just it is you have a lot of aspirations every year to change things and to do a lot of different things.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  And we are iterating all the time.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:21):**  I mean, I wouldn't say that farming is static.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  I mean, I think I just look at our trajectory over the last few years, the number of crops that we've added in and, you know, reducing tillage and continuing to push ourselves for a variety of reasons, whether it's because, you know, costs or production is rising or, you know, just seeing that, you know, a certain practice yields better soil health or whatever it is.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:40):**  But again, I mean, it's you know, it's a super intensive business.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  And, you know, for part of the season, you're just head down and and doing the best that you can.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:48):**  And it's also we're not operating in a greenhouse.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:51):**  I mean, we're operating in the natural system.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  So it is hard to just say because we got a huge cotton yield one year, you know, sometimes just equating that to just like one year's data is not you just can't make assumptions based on one year of information because, you know, one year could be super hot one year.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:10):**  You know, this year we had crazy smoke, you know, which we'd never had, you know, obscuring the solar radiation that we normally would have gotten. And we saw an impact in some of our crops from, you know, lack of sunlight, you know, even though there was warmth that wasn't sunny.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  So I mean, again, from one year to the next, it's just like we're not in such a static environment that you can just say like, I.K., I twisted this lever and that led exactly to this.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:31):**  And I can just say like that I can hang my hat on with 100 percent security that like if I twist that lever again, it's going to do the same exact thing.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  So I think that's a little bit of it is just like hype and noise that jumps around about things.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  And also from farmers, I'm bombarded with microbiological stuff or like every new latest and greatest thing that's going to change your yield and the magnets in your water are going to make the you know.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:56):**  So I mean, we just we get hit from a lot of sides about all these things that are going to be life changing.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  And then it's like every one of them is an investment of time and effort and money to try to do.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:05):**  And then, you know, whether you can again feel super confident that it's going to always perform the same exact way.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  So it's part of it's just that natural system, I think, too, is what gets us hung up, which is, again, why we need that repeatable kind of data year over year to try to make those adjustments.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  And that's why most guys are pretty incremental about their adjustments versus just saying like, I'm just going to go wholesale into this new methodology.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:28):**  And again, like crop margins. And that's why on these regenerative projects that we're doing now, at least this one on cotton, one that we're working on, we actually have the brands came along and actually said, look, well, we will pay for the practices.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  We will buy the lint off the practiced areas.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  We will put in a test check area with your conventional traditional methods.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  If your yield from these new practices doesn't meet up with that, we will offset that.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:54):**  So, I mean, those are the types of collaborations where we go like, hey, we're we are all in. We've got a research partner who's going to back it up.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  It's a three year commitment to each other, maybe longer if we can make it work.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  Everybody then is on board. Everybody's saying like we got some skin in the game.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  Everybody's saying, you know, let's figure this out together.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:11):**  But that to me is like the perfect regenerative collaboration because, you know, it can lead to good information and it leads to a good partnership and then leads to the brand being able to tell a good story about the cotton and where it's coming from.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  I mean, all those parts of it to me is how you're going to really going to drive some of this stuff forward.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  So we're very excited about about that particular program.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  That is exciting. And those are absolutely the types of collaborations, as you alluded to earlier, that need to be built because there's this entire conversation around the need to or the perceived need, the claimed need to educate consumers with the inference being that educated consumers will demand higher quality food.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:51):**  And that is what is going to actually bring about changes in farming practices.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  I personally don't believe that to be true.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:57):**  The reason I don't believe that to be true is I've asked many times I've asked people to give me an example.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  You should just give me one example of where a positive demand compared to negative demand, positive demand has actually produced a significant change in the food supply chain.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  There have been cases where negative demand, such as people desiring to avoid the contamination in meat or spinach or whatever, has had a significant negative impact on the marketplace very, very rapidly.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  Generally, it quickly recovers from that.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  When you think about a positive consumer demand, when has there been a positive consumer demand for a food product that resulted in a change of 50 or 60 percent of the marketplace in a matter of a couple of years?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:40):**  If such an example exists, I haven't been able to identify it yet.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:44):**  I think the conversations that I've had in many cases have been that the characteristics, the fruit and vegetable and the food characteristics of the products that we are consuming are desired by the processors.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  They're desired by the brands and the distributors more than they are by the consumers.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:04):**  No consumer desires a tomato that resembles cardboard more than a tomato.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  But the shipper and the processor does, or the distributor, I should say.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:12):**  And so developing the relationships with brands that are connecting the producer and the consumer, I think, are foundational to producing the type of change that we want to see in the world.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  No, I agree 100 percent.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:27):**  And there's nothing more frustrating than spending my entire year or whatever months growing a tomato and then picking it green and then having people complain about it.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  And that same tomato we leave just for another 10 days that ripens in the field a little bit more is the best tomato somebody's ever eaten.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  And so, you know, all the effort that we put in.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  But it's a great point. The same with the cantaloupes.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  Now there's these extra long life shipper deals that are like a bowling ball that you ship across the country and mealy and disgusting.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:53):**  And it's like, well, I mean, here we wasted all this time and effort to grow this thing and it's less than its subpar.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  But, you know, and even on the aspect of these buyers, you know, the the buyers for a lot of these big brands and retail chains are just it's a numbers.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  We're just it's just a number on a spreadsheet.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  If you buy a cantaloupe for one cent a pound, that's a win.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:12):**  It has nothing to do with the quality.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  It's just like, you know, you could be packing rocks in the box, but they're just as long as they got it for one cent below.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  You know, it has nothing.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  So, yeah, I think connecting to the connecting to the value and giving people a good product to enjoy.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  And then it's like we wonder why some of the consumption of some of these things is going down.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  It's like, well, you're offering an inferior product.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  Why, you know, people aren't going to keep repeatedly coming back to get a crappy cantaloupe.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  But like, you know, we sit there and go, well, you know, woe is me.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  I can't be at we're producing this massive amount of stuff that just isn't that good quality.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  So, yeah, I agree 100 percent.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:44):**  I mean, however, we get to change that dynamic and and again, connect the people with the food again.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  And, you know, destroying seasonality in the United States, I think is a real travesty because you go to, you know,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:56):**  other countries and places where, you know, I mean, I went to Italy once and people were celebrating that the zucchini flowers were in.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:02):**  And every pasta dish had, you know, cut up zucchini flowers and fried.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:06):**  I mean, it was just so neat to see, you know, the connection again to to a seasonal product and just the quality was so much better.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  And, you know, I think we see we do see that. But, you know, you get no getting you get a peach and an off time or whatever.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  You know, everybody just expects these things are just around all the time.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:22):**  And it's, you know, you even know the quality isn't good. The shelves are full of stuff that is, you know.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  So, yeah, I'm hoping that even through this COVID, one of the positives could be that, you know, with people cooking more and staying home more and thinking about food a little more,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:34):**  the shelves have been kind of impacted and things like, you know, maybe we can continue.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  Maybe this accelerates that discussion a little bit. I don't know.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:41):**  It's certainly a conversation that is very badly needed.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  Canon, what is something that you wish more farmers knew or were thinking about?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:49):**  I think more farmers just need to also look at look from another lens. You know, I think I think they need to try to look from try to we really insulate ourselves.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  I think I see the community like we have a this my job depends on ag thing that's started locally.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  But it's we'd like to talk to each other about, you know, our woes and our problems and sometimes don't want to think about like the other the other side of it.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  You know, and people's other concerns, you know, in California, we have a lot of push and pull with the use of water.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  And so environmentalists are sometimes pitted against farmers.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  And, you know, it's a false narrative to say that like it's farms versus the environment because, you know, we're all part of the same environment.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  And just because I'm not passionate or I am passionate about fish, but it's not my primary passion.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:29):**  There doesn't mean that somebody who's passionate about fish, you know, that their their passion isn't valuable.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:34):**  And my passion as a farmer is so valuable.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  I think, you know, we need to have that larger kind of community sense and, you know, understand that we are all on the same page.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:44):**  And I try to make the point that, you know, whatever your passion is, like to my environmentalist friends, I mean, they still need to eat three times a day.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  So farms do I mean, doesn't doesn't absolve us from doing the best job possible.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  But I mean, you really people do need to think more about who they want producing their food and feel good about the choices they make with their dollar.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  Yeah, I would just say it's that we probably get a little too myopic at times and kind of like feel bad for ourselves or feel like the world's against us or something.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  And I just don't think that's a healthy perspective because I think we need to kind of look at that larger picture and how how we play a role in it.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  And like I said earlier, you know, that there are solutions like California did a legislative change where they're trying to collect a lot more green material in the cities,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  but they also don't want that green waste material going into landfills because of emissions, you know, methane.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  And they were using it as cover for these landfills.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  So that's like 15 plus million tons of green product that needs to go somewhere.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:35):**  So, you know, we maybe aren't the right place to do cover crops, but maybe we're the right place to put more compost in the ground.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  And that solves a problem for these urban areas where they're producing a lot more green waste and they need to get rid of it.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  And they don't want to. You know, so that that's just a small example.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  But I think, you know, the more we can find those urban ag partnerships or urban environment partnerships are all three of them.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  In some cases, I know, you know, one water district around us here is getting water from tertiary treated water from a municipality that used to just go out to the ocean.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  Now they're getting it. And some of it's going to the wetland community and some of it's going to the farming community.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:08):**  And like so there you've got herb ag and the environment all working together on a project that is giving water security for for a lot of folks and helping a city with a product that they just were kind of sending out to the ocean.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  Now they're getting paid for some of that. So anyway, I think there's a lot of those examples that we can do on small scale and large scale.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  But, you know, that that connected nature of, you know, kind of all in this together and how do we get better together versus kind of tearing each other down?  
**[0:42:31-0:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  I'm reminded of a quote which, if I recall, is correctly attributed to Benjamin Franklin said that if we were to sit down and have a conversation, we would find that the points we agree on are many and the points that we disagree on are few.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:46):**  And I think if we could approach more of our conversations from that perspective, we would we would have much more productive outcomes for everyone involved.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S4_Ep1_Cannon_Michael_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:55):**  Cannon, I want to say thank you very much for joining us and for sharing your wisdom and thoughts.

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2022-12-20)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. Welcome and thank you for being here and for listening.  At this place, this time here on the podcast,  we talk about the agronomic science and the cultural management practices that have the capacity to  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:00:18):**  regenerate plant health, soil health, and public health.  And I also want to give a shout out to the amazing team that we have at Advancing Eco-Agriculture  that supports this podcast and really allows this to be.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:00:31):**  I find my life so enriched by being able to work with them.  You know, here on the podcast and my own journey has really been informed by  not just reading and theory, although I certainly enjoy that,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:00:46):**  but able to actually implement it on scale and see what works and see what doesn't work.  And that's something that all of us as individuals  need to constantly evolve and become better at.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:00:58):**  So for this podcast today, for this episode,  I have looked forward to this conversation for a long time, and I have a lot of joy in  inviting Fred Provenza, who has  
**[0:01:11-0:01:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:01:11):**  done a lot of amazing work on animal nutrition,  ruminant interactions with ecology and human health and human nutrition and how we should be grazing on our food.  And so there is so much richness. You know, one of the joys of having Fred here  
**[0:01:28-0:01:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:01:28):**  and one of the challenges is when you have someone who has such  depth and such breadth of their life work, the question is really,  where do you begin? Where do you start? And where might you end up?  
**[0:01:40-0:01:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:01:40):**  So I look forward to that.  Fred, thank you very much for being here.  And I can't possibly do justice to your story of  
**[0:01:50-0:02:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:01:50):**  what you have experienced in your life, what you've worked on and where you are today.  So I'd love it if you could just share that with us. What has your pathway been?  Well, John, it's wonderful to be here with you. I, too, have really looked forward to this  
**[0:02:04-0:02:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:02:04):**  conversation. And the first thing that pops into my mind as you ask that question is,  for me, it's been about relationships with other people. You know, it's easy to focus on the individual and  what, quote, that individual has done throughout their lifetime. But I never see my life in that  
**[0:02:22-0:02:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:02:22):**  sense. I see it as relationships with other folks and give total credit to the roles that  they've played as I've gone along in my life. From my parents' beginning, you know, back as a pup,  growing up in the mountains of Colorado, I can relate very much when people talk about the  
**[0:02:43-0:03:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:02:43):**  importance of place in our life, of the place that we come from. My heart has never left the place  that I was born and raised, those mountains, even though I've traveled all over the globe.  I've always had such deep linkages to those places. And as a young pup growing up, I was  
**[0:03:04-0:03:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:03:04):**  just fascinated by the natural world. If it moved, breathed, I want to say, or whatever  insects and everything else do. I was fascinated in it. I just absolutely loved it. And  as I went along a bit in my schooling and started learning about plants, they just,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:03:26):**  I just got enthralled, absolutely enthralled with plants, initially just identifying them.  This whole world, this whole universe, I had never really seen  until I took the first plant class and plant taxonomy. And it was just,  
**[0:03:42-0:03:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:03:42):**  you know, it makes you think how many worlds within worlds within worlds are right there  in front of us and we don't see them. But that certainly happened with me with plants. And,  you know, I heard you talking about plant intelligence here recently.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:03:56):**  And amen to everything you were saying. It's just, you know, what little I've learned about  them. And none of it was deliberate. We were working with these goats down in southern Utah  to prune this shrub black brush during the winter, stimulate this new growth that we knew was more  
**[0:04:13-0:04:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:04:13):**  nutritious, higher in energy, protein, minerals, all those things. Come to find out, most of the  goats didn't even want to eat it. And that started a huge adventure for me about how  these so-called secondary compounds mediate interactions with the environment and how plants  
**[0:04:32-0:04:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:04:32):**  are actively participating in everything that's going on. So when you were talking a little bit  about plant intelligence and consciousness of plants, very interesting topic.  I find it so interesting that we have this popular narrative or perception, if you will,  
**[0:04:55-0:05:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:04:55):**  that plants are somehow inanimate objects that just happen to have life. And as you dig into  the research, you realize that in fact, plants are self-aware, they are aware of their environment,  they are aware of their environment, and they make informed decisions and informed choices.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:05:16):**  They have a neural network that is identical to our own, except that in some cases it might be  significantly larger. And they communicate with each other. And one of my favorite comics,  I've discussed it several times, is there was this drawing sketch that I saw of two trees,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:05:35):**  and a human is walking by and one tree says to the other, do you suppose humans can communicate?  And the other tree says, no, how can they possibly? They don't have roots.  You know, while that is funny, yeah, there's also the realization that plants don't just  
**[0:05:57-0:06:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:05:57):**  communicate through their roots. We're starting to understand that better, but they're communicating  in the electromagnetic spectrum and literally talking with electromagnetic signals to each  other constantly through the atmosphere and through the soil. So anyway, it's a marvelous  
**[0:06:11-0:06:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:06:11):**  world that we live in that we're mostly blind to. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely the case that,  yes, yeah, the communication, all the senses that plants have, 20 or more different senses that  you're alluding to in one way or another. And I often think, you know, many a quote dumb plant has  
**[0:06:31-0:06:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:06:31):**  outfoxed all the agronomists and people that are trying to kill them one way or another, right?  They're always a step ahead of us. And then one thinks, as you're saying, self-aware, conscious,  sentient, and they're the givers of life, really, I think that so much, you know. And so this whole  
**[0:06:54-0:07:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:06:54):**  debate that we often get into of sentience and we shouldn't be killing animals because they are  sentient, I think the broader issue to me is that all life is sacred. It's all sacred and we're part  of that. And then, you know, to think out of that, that, as you were saying the other day, and I  
**[0:07:14-0:07:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:07:14):**  chuckled when you're talking about that the rhizophage, the plants are actually carnivores,  which is happy, munching on bacteria as they can. No, but you know, life lives on life, right? And  acknowledging that and, you know, I think of the years when I was on the ranch, I worked on a ranch  
**[0:07:35-0:07:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:07:35):**  for seven years in Colorado, and, you know, we were just so, so I don't know what it feels like  to be an ant. But that's what I used to think when I was there on the ranch, all the things in  the different seasons that we would do from irrigating crops to harvesting crops to caring  
**[0:07:56-0:08:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:07:56):**  for animals and those rhythms that went from the spring, the early spring through the summer,  through the fall, and then into the winter, it just felt so deeply connected. And then there  were things, you know, growing of our gardens and our food, and then butchering hogs in the fall or  
**[0:08:18-0:08:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:08:18):**  whatever it was. And just that intimate relationship with the natural environment made you feel  linked in ways that the whole debate that we get into over what to eat and not eat was kind of  not relevant at that point. It was that we're a part of, I don't know if I'm expressing that very  
**[0:08:42-0:09:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:08:42):**  well, but we're a part of all of that. And it's all sacred in a sense.  It is all sacred in a sense. And as we're learning, it's all sentient. It's all self-aware,  plants as well as animals. And so there are many people who have approached their dietary choices  
**[0:09:05-0:09:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:09:05):**  from a desire of doing no harm. They chose not to be carnivores because of their perception that  they're doing harm. And as the realization grows of that, that plants have similar levels of  consciousness and cognition, that brings an interesting element to that conversation. And  
**[0:09:24-0:09:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:09:24):**  so I think from, from my perspective, I would say it this way, plants and animals desire to  contribute. We desire to contribute and as similarly they desire to contribute and we  should accept their contribution with gratitude, whether that is whether we're consuming plants,  
**[0:09:44-0:10:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:09:44):**  whether we're consuming animals, when we accept that into our bodies, that nourishment with love  and gratitude, it completely changes the, our relationship with that food, our relationship  with where it came from and the way that it influences our bodies and our health as well.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:10:01):**  Oh, absolutely. Well said. Well said, John. You know, I often think too, you know, there's a small  percentage of the population who are farmers and ranchers who are actually growing produce or,  or animals or so forth, but we can all be quote farmers and ranchers if we own even a little plot  
**[0:10:23-0:10:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:10:23):**  of ground, we can think about what we grow on that plot of ground. I'm really a proponent of  thinking about what were the native species that grew in the place that you live  and encouraging them to grow as a really important part of where you are. It reduces use of fossil  
**[0:10:46-0:11:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:10:46):**  fuels, pesticides, herbicides, when you allow that diversity and it encourages life below and above  ground. And what's amazing, we, and I'm not trying to be a big proponent for what Sue and I do,  that's what we've done here in Ennis. And it's amazing the number of people that stop and say,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:11:07):**  how beautiful your, your yard is. And so, well, this is just the native plants that grow here  and seasonally, what's flowering changes from early spring to late spring, to summer, to fall.  You have this beautiful bouquets of, of wildflowers and grasses when you get into the grasses.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:11:29):**  And then the diversity of different insect life, for instance, I'm thinking about now bees,  your honeybees that love to come and visit our place because there's a whole, a whole variety  of different plants. We do have a little bit of, of lawn that's planted around the house. It was  
**[0:11:48-0:12:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:11:48):**  here when we came, we didn't get rid of it, but we've really encouraged, encouraged clover  throughout the yard. We didn't have to do anything. It was there. We just didn't kill it.  And it spread throughout the lawn. Well, that's fixing nitrogen and boy, do the honeybees love  
**[0:12:03-0:12:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:12:03):**  to come and hit the clovers throughout the yard too. So, you know, we're not sound old now, but  I'm going to say it. When, when I was growing up in this little town of Salida in central Colorado,  the grandparents and older generation all did that. They all had beautiful gardens, herbal,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:12:23):**  vegetable gardens. They raised chickens. Some of them even had a hog. They were still really  intimately linked with plants and animals in their lives, in the sense that we're trying to  articulate here. But I saw that really disappear during my parents' generation. And then from that  
**[0:12:43-0:12:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:12:43):**  generation on, it seemed like that, that, and if you drive around that little town of Salida,  you don't see so much of that anymore. Yeah, it's certainly something that has been, seems to have  been lost with the last several generations as we've moved primarily to the cities. And we have  
**[0:12:59-0:13:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:12:59):**  a very tiny proportion of our overall population that has a close connection to the rural landscape  and to the countryside and to food production. And I like your point that we can, and we should  actually experience that in our homes, even if we have small lawns. And you know, one thing that I  
**[0:13:16-0:13:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:13:16):**  find interesting is how many farmers, and even particularly farmers across the Midwest, were  growing lots of, let's say corn and soybeans and wheat and commodity crops, may not even have their  own gardens and may not even be growing their own food. I think that's such an opportunity for us to  
**[0:13:32-0:13:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:13:32):**  develop a close connection. Absolutely the case. And when I think, when you mention that, I think  back to those years on the ranch and they hadn't lost that. Those people still were so, you know,  they had had chickens for their eggs, it wasn't a commercial thing, and beautiful, beautiful,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:13:57):**  beautiful gardens, beautiful gardens, nourished with the manure that came from the animals.  I'm reading a book right now, I agreed to write a foreword to a book, and it's on pastoralism.  And it's just a beautiful, beautiful book about nearly one billion people on this planet  
**[0:14:17-0:14:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:14:17):**  and their way of life, the pastoral way of life. And there's a part in there where the author is  talking about, where pastoralism often gets integrated in with farming systems. And in this  particular case is that she's illustrating the farmers actually pay the pastoralists  
**[0:14:41-0:15:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:14:41):**  to put their animals on their fields after the harvest, because the manure from those animals  is such a rich source of nutrients. And they draw very, very sharp distinction between manure from  animals foraging on diverse landscapes that then come in and deposit that manure on their fields  
**[0:15:02-0:15:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:15:02):**  versus commercial fertilizer and how it just trashes the land that they're on. It's, you know,  they're not studying all of these things. They're students of life, right? They're watching what's  happening. And then a point that gets brought out too is that the flavor, the flavor of those  
**[0:15:21-0:15:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:15:21):**  foods is so fantastic that they grow on those plots compared with the commercial fertilizer.  So hitting on, she just touches as she's going along on many, many points related to the  relationship between domestic animals and crops and health of landscapes. This connects so well  
**[0:15:45-0:16:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:15:45):**  with your work on an understanding of the gut microbiome for livestock and for people and how  that changes and evolves with the diet. And so when you think about ruminants or animals coming  to graze on land that previously were, had a very diverse diet with lots of diverse forages,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:16:06):**  their microbiome is invariably going to be much more complex, more sophisticated, more nuanced,  more diverse than if they're just consuming a handful of crops from a TMR mixer. And so I think  that's something that's perhaps not often contemplated in our agricultural system is that  
**[0:16:24-0:16:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:16:24):**  manure is not manure. We're really not talking about, we should not be thinking about manure  from a nutrient application perspective, but from a microbial perspective and what is the  microbiome contribution that it's adding. Oh, such a good point, such a good point. And it takes me  
**[0:16:40-0:17:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:16:40):**  back probably 50 years now when I was a younger pup, reading a paper by some ecologists that were  making the point that you just made that the more diverse the diet of the ruminant animals,  the richer the microbiome of those animals. And they were thinking in terms of these secondary  
**[0:17:02-0:17:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:17:02):**  compounds, these tens of thousands of compounds that plants produce and simply pointing out that  when animals are eating those, they're creating niches for all these different species of bacteria  protozoa and on and on and on in the gut. And I remember how that hit me 50 years ago when I read  
**[0:17:27-0:17:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:17:27):**  that paper, it's like, yeah, that's really, that's amazing. And ruminant nutritionists had been  focusing on the gut microbiome for years and years and years. In fact, when I first entered into some  of that, I got a little bit bored with that because surely there's more than just the microbiome.  
**[0:17:48-0:18:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:17:48):**  There are these other organs and there's a brain on this creature. But they appreciated,  they very much appreciated. And when animals were moved from rangelands and they talked a lot about  cellulolytic bacteria, digest bacteria that break down cellulose, and when they move into feedlots  
**[0:18:11-0:18:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:18:11):**  and get on high grain diets, why the microbiome shifts in big ways toward starch digesting  bacteria. So at a broad scale, we're talking about some of what we're talking about, but at  a much more nuanced level, it's certainly the more diverse the diet, the more diverse the gut  
**[0:18:31-0:18:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:18:31):**  microbiome. And it makes me think of the Hadzas in Africa, the people that anthropologists have  studied so much and nutritionists and how incredibly diverse their gut microbiome is.  And it's linked directly to what we're talking about. They eat this tremendously diverse  
**[0:18:49-0:19:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:18:49):**  diet of plant and animal foods. You know, when I was looking forward to our conversation,  I was rereading your most recent book titled Nourishment. And for all of our listeners,  there is no possible way in a podcast interview to record all the wisdom that Fred has shared  
**[0:19:09-0:19:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:19:09):**  in his book. So I highly recommend looking up his book Nourishment. We'll link it in the show notes.  But one of the, like I read very widely and with enough depth and background of thinking  about these possible connections, I'm seldom surprised anymore. But I was delighted and  
**[0:19:30-0:19:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:19:30):**  overjoyed to read about Clara's kids and the story that you shared. Can you tell us about  how these children self-selected their diet?  Yes, that's it's a delightful story. And I'm going to give you a little bit of background  
**[0:19:46-0:20:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:19:46):**  about that. I had not heard about the work that Clara Davis did roughly a hundred years ago now,  until an author in Canada, Mark Shaxter, contacted me. He read some research that we were doing.  We were looking at animals, cattle in feedlots, and we were very interested in the ability of  
**[0:20:10-0:20:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:20:10):**  animals to self-select their own diet. And so we said, well, what would happen if we had two groups  of cattle, one that was allowed to self-select the individual ingredients that were in a total  mixed ration and the other that were fed the total mixed ration. And that was a very interesting  
**[0:20:30-0:20:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:20:30):**  eye-opening study to me. And we found in that study, I'm working my way to Clara,  but I want to make this background first. We found that when animals were given a choice,  no two individuals ever selected the same combination of foods and no animal ever selected  
**[0:20:53-0:21:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:20:53):**  the same foods from day to day. And so we found that when animals were given a choice,  no one ever selected the same foods from day to day. But every one of those animals offered a  choice grew just fine during the two months that we were doing this finishing trial. But what was  
**[0:21:12-0:21:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:21:12):**  even more amazing was, you know, what would you think if you offer animals a total mixed ration  versus a choice, which group's going to eat the most food? I'll be honest with you. I thought,  and I thought, you know, if you have a choice and they have these different things, that group's  
**[0:21:28-0:21:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:21:28):**  probably going to eat more food. I was wrong. And that just, and the more I thought about that,  I thought, you know, it makes perfect, perfect sense. But it's something we don't stop to think  about. Well, why would they, the animals on the total mixed ration eat more? One hypothesis,  
**[0:21:46-0:22:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:21:46):**  and it's supported actually by people who study humans, is that in order to meet needs for certain  animals, they're going to have to have a total mixed ration. Let's just take protein as an  example. Some individuals are going to have to over-ingest. They're going to have to eat more  
**[0:22:05-0:22:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:22:05):**  energy in order to meet their needs for protein. And so what we found was that it cost less to  finish those animals on that ration because they were actually eating less food. So let's go to  the next slide. So the animal that was in the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:22:22):**  ration was a woman who had to finish these children, but she had 15 children given up for  adoption in this nursery. And can you imagine following those children for six years, recording  everything they ate each day for six years, and they were offered 34 foods available seasonally  
**[0:22:43-0:23:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:22:43):**  for the purposes of these foods. And the people working on the study were instructed,  don't give those children a hint of anything that they should eat. You just lay it out and you let  them eat it each day. And so what Clara concluded was no two children ever selected the same  
**[0:23:03-0:23:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:23:03):**  combination of foods. No child ever selected the same food from day to day. But every one of them  had a diet that met their needs. And there was a pediatrician who was following the children,  writing papers. I read the papers that they produced said they'd never seen a healthier set  
**[0:23:21-0:23:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:23:21):**  of children. So it speaks then to what we were studying in those years and what Clara was  interested in, this whole idea that there's a wisdom of the body that knows what the body  needs. If it's provided suitable alternatives, the children in this case or the cattle in our case,  
**[0:23:43-0:24:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:23:43):**  will select what they need to meet their needs. It also points out, and Clara made a point of this,  over the years it was so striking to me how no two individuals are alike. If you think about that,  no two individuals have ever been or will ever be alike on this planet. It's amazing. And you think  
**[0:24:07-0:24:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:24:07):**  how that comes about, you have genes being expressed in ever-changing environments,  and then nature adds a pinch of chance just to keep things interesting at the molecular level  during development. And so you have this marvelous kind of way that everything is absolutely unique  
**[0:24:27-0:24:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:24:27):**  in the plant world, in the animal world, and all uniquely interacting and co-evolving one with  another. So Clara was making a point of that related to her children. When you think about  the biochemical individuality that all of us have and our capacity, what I found really interesting  
**[0:24:50-0:25:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:24:50):**  about her study and other related works, similar to the work that you did on livestock, is that  almost invariably when there is the opportunity for people or for animals to follow this inherent  body's wisdom, they end up not only healthier, but more intelligent in the case of people,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:25:12):**  more coherent or cognizant, if you will. I'm not quite sure what the right words are here,  but there are additional levels of discernment. And perhaps you could say intellectual intensity  and awareness that emerge. And this also speaks back to Mark Schatzker's work that you mentioned  
**[0:25:33-0:25:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:25:33):**  in his awesome book, The Dorito Effect, where all of us have this sense if we allowed ourselves to  express it and if we don't pollute it with sugar and fats and salt and MSG.  Yes, absolutely the case. I think that's, if we're hitting on the key here, is having available to  
**[0:25:54-0:26:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:25:54):**  you wholesome foods, wholesome plant and animal foods, and then simply allowing the body to do  what it's done for our species and for all the different species on this planet over the eons.  And it's that wisdom. But it's so easy to have that hijacked, as Mark points out in The Dorito  
**[0:26:15-0:26:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:26:15):**  Effect, how the food industry has been able to hijack that. And I can relate so much to what  you're saying, John, from a physical standpoint, from a spiritual standpoint, you know, each one is  unique. And tapping into that uniqueness in ways that don't harm others in a sense, but  
**[0:26:38-0:27:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:26:38):**  being who you are, not trying to be someone else, something else, just simply, I've often thought  that, and when I was at the university, I thought that so much, you know, there's a big difference  between what I would call teachers and preachers. Preachers tell you, telling you, huh? And I may be  
**[0:27:00-0:27:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:27:00):**  too negative here. I'm not trying to get after preachers. I'm just, a teacher leads you to your  wisdom, to your inner wisdom. It doesn't try to tell you what you are or how to be. It leads you  to that. And you figure that out, you know, it's the challenge. You figure that out. And from diet  
**[0:27:21-0:27:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:27:21):**  standpoint, and nobody can tell you just, I love that in the diet studies, you know, any study of  particular diet, some people lose weight, some people gain a bunch of weight on what should be  a diet. Well, that's the body being the uniqueness. So nobody can tell you those things. And I think  
**[0:27:40-0:28:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:27:40):**  that very much from a spiritual standpoint too, it's the journey. And, you know, do the work,  do the, and it's in a way it's work, in a way it's not work, but I think it's so easy to maybe not be  who you are in the sense that we're talking. To have that hijacked in one way or another without  
**[0:28:02-0:28:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:28:02):**  even realizing it. It starts in utero. It's our work, we're showing in utero early in life,  you're being of necessity, brought into a particular culture at a particular time and  place, and you're learning that. But as you go along then, trying to come to grips with who  
**[0:28:24-0:28:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:28:24):**  really are you. And that can be a bit of a challenge actually, because it's at such deep  levels that we become acculturated, right? Yeah. So Fred, you just made mention of your work and  your studies and the in utero training that happens of food awareness and food sensitivities  
**[0:28:46-0:29:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:28:46):**  and so forth. We never quite arrived to you telling us about your research or some of your  work with observing animals in the landscape and how they interact. And I'd love for you to tell  us a little bit about that and how that, I'll maybe offer some more context. I mean, there's  
**[0:29:10-0:29:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:29:10):**  many different places you could take this conversation, I'm sure. One of the questions that  emerges for me is when I drive across the Midwest and then the Great Plains and the High Plains,  you introduced me to this wonderful book, The Art and Science of Shepherding. Thank you very much,  
**[0:29:27-0:29:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:29:27):**  by the way, I've really been enjoying it. And when we consider the wisdom that shepherds can bring  to a landscape and managing that landscape, there's the question that emerges, what are the  possibilities for regenerating these ecosystems that have very low rainfall with shepherding as  
**[0:29:51-0:30:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:29:51):**  contrasted to the management intensive grazing electric fencing model that is widely promoted  in Stockman Grass Farmer and other similar publications and so forth. So I'd love to get  your perspective. That's a broad field. You can take it any place you want to go.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:30:08):**  Okay, that's a great question and it could go a lot of places, right? And so to say a word  at first, I've worked with many people who have been involved and have great respect  for those people involved with management intensive grazing and you know the notion  
**[0:30:30-0:30:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:30:30):**  and Jim Garish coined the term management intensive and the reason was that the focus  is on management, of being involved with the animals. And you know fences was what electric  fences was one way to do that certainly and but the emphasis was on management and paying  
**[0:30:49-0:31:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:30:49):**  attention to those animals and working with those animals. So I want to you know before that Alan  Savory and I've known and worked closely with these people over the years and very much  appreciate that. The shepherding I think is just the most nuanced, amazing way and I mentioned  
**[0:31:10-0:31:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:31:10):**  that I'm reading a book on that now on pastoralism and shepherding agreed to write a  foreword for it and it's just bringing back all of the beauty and the nuance that's involved in  in this intimate relationship that you become family with the animals basically.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:31:30):**  You're all part of a family and in working with Michel Merie in France and who's really the  the person who was key in that book on shepherding that you just mentioned.  You know the shepherds it's really a co-evolution I think the shepherds are learning from the  
**[0:31:55-0:32:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:31:55):**  animals, the animals then in turn are learning from the shepherds and the whole system is co-evolving  and being so very locally adapted to the environments that they're inhabiting.  And so when you talk about lowering costs and you know I think about some of the environments  
**[0:32:17-0:32:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:32:17):**  I worked over the years and reading this book is making me think of that too some of the very harsh  arid environments and seeing the animals and how so many suites of characteristics were coming  together from the frame size of the animals you know on these very arid environments you can't  
**[0:32:39-0:33:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:32:39):**  have an enormous animal given its needs but as you move toward sheep and goats but also cattle  of smaller frame sizes and then the kind of things that we were studying about how these experiences  in utero and early in life are really enabling organ systems of the body to better utilize the  
**[0:33:02-0:33:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:33:02):**  foods that are in those environments seasonally. I remember working with the goats in southern Utah  as we mentioned very briefly early on and in the last year of that study we were working with cattle  on those different pastures and I remember the ranchers I was working with saying you're not  
**[0:33:23-0:33:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:33:23):**  going to believe it when you see how these animals how these cattle mow black brush how they put their  heads down and they are brush mowing beasts and it was you know it was mind-boggling because what  we think of and we tend to categorize you know goats goats eat browse sheep eat forbs cows eat  
**[0:33:44-0:34:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:33:44):**  grass right but I would say throughout most of my career I've always pushed back against that  because that that's so general and and you can find many many examples where all of them do  different things and this was an example down there where these cattle it was just stunning to  
**[0:34:04-0:34:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:34:04):**  see just you I used to each year when we'd go down and spend four months with those goats down  there living with them I used to think how on earth can they eat this stuff how can they live  on this diet of black brush hardly anything else to choose from and then when I watched those  
**[0:34:25-0:34:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:34:25):**  cattle it was just it was amazing to see them put their heads down and just mow the brush so  you know but all these things then as we were showing with different organ systems of the body  they're all responding in ways and adapting in ways that are are enhancing the opportunity and  
**[0:34:46-0:35:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:34:46):**  the ability of those animals to utilize the forages that are in the environment so you have  that as you know it was I'm thinking of studies we did with straw where we were feeding cattle  during pregnancy the last trimester ammoniated straw and then comparing the response of their  
**[0:35:06-0:35:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:35:06):**  offspring with with offspring that had been whose mothers had been on a much more nutritious diet  and those young animals who were exposed in the womb to straw not only did they eat more straw  they digested that straw better they grew faster so I think then okay now let's put that to to  
**[0:35:27-0:35:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:35:27):**  to a way a rancher might look at it out here in the in the arid west if you want to cut the costs  of ranch operation the best way to do that is to get out of the fossil fuel loops get out of the  hang get out of the machinery get all of that out of your operation have your animals wintering  
**[0:35:46-0:36:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:35:46):**  on forages and then you think well forages are poor quality during the winter but if your mother  has exposed you to poor quality forages in utero you're already in an advantage your body is being  prepared and this book on not at liberty quite yet to mention they don't have a title for it  
**[0:36:06-0:36:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:36:06):**  it's all it's written and everything they're trying to decide the title but it is a beautifully  written book about all the nuance that goes into to that with examples from around the world  whether it's reindeer herders up north to pastoralists in in india or africa or wherever  
**[0:36:26-0:36:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:36:26):**  and it's it's very much about your question and what what I would say in my mind it means to be  really locally co-evolving with those arid kind of of landscapes and I can't help but think as I  read that that knowledge could become so absolutely invaluable as we as we transition out of an era  
**[0:36:49-0:37:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:36:49):**  where fossil fuels have really enabled us to to do things that historically our ancestors were  unable to do in terms of of all that energy that's in a barrel of oil helping us to grow food  moving back to this to this lifestyle that very intimately involves pastoralism and a close  
**[0:37:12-0:37:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:37:12):**  relationship with animals and then their close linkages with the farming systems beautiful way  of life so what you're describing is as the the what I'm coming away with is that in fact animals  have an inherent capacity the right animals to adapt to their environment and what we would  
**[0:37:36-0:37:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:37:36):**  consider to be extraordinarily difficult environments to a degree that may be much  greater than we might appreciate or expect absolutely the case absolutely the case if  I just hope that our conversation can make that come alive to the point and I'm throwing the  
**[0:37:53-0:38:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:37:53):**  cattle in there to to try to ill I don't know how to paint a mental picture of how harsh black brush  landscapes are this monoculture of this shrub that's that looks like not even a goat could  survive on it and yet here these cattle that are wintering in these landscapes they weren't  
**[0:38:12-0:38:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:38:12):**  expecting them to you know they would they moved seasonally as pastoralists have done historically  they moved seasonally out of those but in the winter that's where they were and then they would  move move up to higher elevations as as green forage became available surfing the green web  
**[0:38:30-0:38:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:38:30):**  the green wave it's called now people any culture in the old days people call follow the green  follow the green up the anyway it's this idea of moving moving with the as the vegetation  greens up moving up the hillsides and into the mountains and so forth and then wintering on the  
**[0:38:50-0:39:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:38:50):**  poor quality foods so I want to come back to the question that I had asked earlier and ask it in  a slightly different way from from your perspective with the observations the experiences that you've  had what is the possibility and what is the pathway forward for regenerating these millions  
**[0:39:12-0:39:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:39:12):**  of acres in the arid west I think the possibility is great I think in a way those landscapes you  know many of them are composed still of native plant species that are are incredibly adapted  to to the locations where they're growing and through the the management of grazing simply  
**[0:39:38-0:39:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:39:38):**  managing the grazing going back to what we were saying is really all that it takes we did a lot  of work over the years to looking at landscapes that had been quote degraded in one way or another  and then thinking about how through time and timing of grazing and encouraging species that  
**[0:39:58-0:40:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:39:58):**  we wanted to to encourage you know it was amazing to me to learn over the 40 50 years we were  involved with that of how through time and timing and animal species of grazing you could encourage  different species of plants to grow on those landscapes you could really co-create on those  
**[0:40:20-0:40:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:40:20):**  landscapes and you could we were very much involved over the years in enhancing biodiversity  of landscapes of moving away from annual plants toward perennial plant species enhancing diversity  you know when I went to Utah State University back 50 years ago I did it for a couple of reasons  
**[0:40:41-0:40:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:40:41):**  one it was the only university that would take me as a graduate student and to it was a program  that was made for me I was very interested in wildlife and wildlife biology and my idea was  to study mountain goats foraging in the in the rocky mountains of Colorado so I end up studying  
**[0:40:59-0:41:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:40:59):**  domestic goats on this shrub black brush that nothing could be more boring well it turned out  to be totally the the best thing could ever have happened to me I'm thinking but the program I got  associated with at Utah State University had for many years been using domestic animals to improve  
**[0:41:18-0:41:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:41:18):**  habitat for wildlife species and I thought that's beautiful thing when I was at undergrad  in wildlife biology there was this animosity between range people who were interested in  livestock livestock grazing and wildlife people who were interested in wildlife species and  
**[0:41:35-0:41:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:41:35):**  diversity and it was like you know always butting heads and these two quote people thought were  mutually exclusive worlds and here were people that were saying no we can use domestic animals  to enhance landscape for wildlife species I thought this is something I want to be associated  
**[0:41:50-0:42:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:41:50):**  with and so you know you just come to I mean certainly the the the west is arid it's it can  seem I think depending on which part of the globe a person's coming from to be formidable and  hostile kind of landscapes but when you look at the diversity of different plant species are there  
**[0:42:11-0:42:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:42:11):**  and what you can do to maintain or enhance that diversity well at the same time um  working with domestic animals and using them as to manage landscapes for for the greater good it's  it's impressive but it goes back to where we started it's about the management it's about  
**[0:42:31-0:42:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:42:31):**  being involved and that's where I think you know we we really came to rely and in the years I was  on the ranch I say the same thing we came to rely on fences as babysitters they were good  babysitters right well we did the farming down in the on the ranch and we were able to  
**[0:42:47-0:43:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:42:47):**  yeah on the ranch in Colorado we put the animals up on the landscapes administered by the forest  service and they were using what was called rest rotation grazing back in those days where you  would you know it was designed to try to to maintain the health of plant communities by  
**[0:43:05-0:43:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:43:05):**  moving animals to different pastures in different ways across different seasons and and different  years but basically we put the animals up there and we go out run up and check on them what we  could and on horseback and so forth but but that's a totally different deal from if we were up there  
**[0:43:25-0:43:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:43:25):**  shepherding those animals and herding those animals and moving those animals in ways that  get talked about in that book on shepherding and I'll put in a plug for my friend Glenn Elzinga  who is is doing fabulous things with shepherding practices with cattle in Idaho up in the Salmon,  
**[0:43:43-0:44:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:43:43):**  Idaho region and just the nuance and and the understanding of behavior of animals that that  people come to have when they're living with those animals it's it's phenomenal and you think  and you think and for the listeners that may not be familiar with some of this when a shepherd in  
**[0:44:08-0:44:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:44:08):**  France is looking at a landscape they're looking at how to utilize that entire landscape not just  the best what we would consider oh that's the best grazing there and this is horrible so we won't  even utilize it they're thinking about how to utilize the entire landscape and they're thinking  
**[0:44:25-0:44:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:44:25):**  about appetizer phases main courses booster stages dessert stages and so forth to these meals to these  day-long meals and that's what's you know that's where our work intersected with with Michel Mireille  and the work that he was doing in France and that the book that came out of all that because we were  
**[0:44:46-0:45:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:44:46):**  thinking about how plant diversity enables individuality of animals and enables animals to  compose their own diets and then we were thinking about complementarities how you know if an animal  meets certain mixes of plants that can enable them to utilize plants that they might not ordinarily  
**[0:45:08-0:45:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:45:08):**  be able to touch due to complementarities and then we got into sequences well if you eat an  appetizer of this it can help you so let me get specific here give a couple of examples I'll start  with some shrub species that that we work with there's a shrub called sagebrush that is the  
**[0:45:28-0:45:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:45:28):**  primary one of the primary plants growing in the great basin this huge five-state region that goes  from Utah and up through the northwest into Washington and so forth sagebrush has come to  dominate many of those landscapes through grazing practices where people grazed in the spring of the  
**[0:45:46-0:46:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:45:46):**  year when sagebrush is very high in terpene concentrations spring and summer and so animals  don't want to utilize sagebrush at all then that means they utilize the understory grasses and  forms so that encourages domination by sagebrush so you end up with monocultures of sagebrush  
**[0:46:05-0:46:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:46:05):**  and then you start to think about well how can we move away from those monocultures and so forth  and there are various ways that you can do that but one has to do with diversity and one has to  do with the species called bitterbrush bitterbrush happens to be high in tannins and as it turns out  
**[0:46:21-0:46:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:46:21):**  tannins in bitterbrush will form complexes with terpenes in sagebrush and so what would ordinarily  either one of those plant species alone may be strongly limiting of how much an animal can eat  when you have them in combination that complementarity enables the animals to eat much  
**[0:46:40-0:46:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:46:40):**  more of of the combination of species if if i can if i can just conclude that what you're saying is  that if you then shift grazing management to the fall you now have the presence of both of those  plants that you can combine is that right yes yes yep that's right you can utilize that you can  
**[0:46:57-0:47:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:46:57):**  you can utilize both those species in the fall i'm thinking too about fall and winter kind of  grazing fall and winter grazing in particular in that sense that's right so that that complementarity  that complementarity can can also lead to the demise of sagebrush actually you can reduce them  
**[0:47:17-0:47:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:47:17):**  i'm thinking of where where we were living in in logan utah there's a game fence that they built  many years ago about eight feet high game fence to prevent mule deer from coming down into the valley  bottom in the winter if you look at the at the if you walk along that game fence and you look at the  
**[0:47:36-0:47:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:47:36):**  plant species and the mix of species that's growing there nowadays and then you look below the game  fence above the game friends there's real strong domination by bitter brush and not much sagebrush  that's left below the game fence there's a pretty good mix now of bitter brush and sagebrush so why  
**[0:47:57-0:48:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:47:57):**  does that happen during the winter time the bitter brush is enabling the the mule deer to utilize the  sagebrush to a greater degree and sagebrush doesn't tolerate browsing nearly as well as bitter brush  does so we're getting into maybe more details of plant dynamics than a person wants but that's how  
**[0:48:19-0:48:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:48:19):**  those things play out on landscapes right yeah it's important for us to understand to to the  degree that we can influence and as you said to co-create on our landscapes that in fact we can  change entire plant populations and the dominance or the presence of different plant populations  
**[0:48:35-0:48:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:48:35):**  based on grazing management and or on grazing mismanagement that's absolutely that we say nuance  but it's the big picture it's the thing and that's what we worked with for years and years and years  that's what range science this whole discipline of range science has kind of gone extinct over  
**[0:48:54-0:49:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:48:54):**  the years but you know that's what it was about was about understanding plant behavior really and  animal behavior and the relationships between plants and animals and then the ways that through  grazing management you can have such big impacts we throw in another thing here too related to  
**[0:49:12-0:49:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:49:12):**  plants like bitter brush that are high in tannins those tannins help to reduce methane emissions so  that gets another part of this story related to to interactions amongst gut microbiome  the combination of species in the diet and so forth so no there's so much that that can be done  
**[0:49:34-0:49:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:49:34):**  and then thinking about that's what we say well in a way you do become a co-creator and it's  thinking about well what what is it that you you would like to encourage on this landscape  from the standpoint of of your grazing management i mentioned earlier that the program i came on to  
**[0:49:55-0:50:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:49:55):**  was interested in in enhancing the abundance of wildlife species by creating forages that that  would really benefit them during seasonally and so we're using the grazing management to do that  with cattle one other comment on complementarities from a pasture standpoint plants like endophyte  
**[0:50:14-0:50:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:50:14):**  infected tofescue that are are common on many many millions of acres of landscape and by all  rights is that's a toxic plant when you look at the alkaloids in fescue and what they can do and  so forth and you know for years and years when i was interacting with people from the natural  
**[0:50:33-0:50:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:50:33):**  resource conservation service they said you know you need to get diversity in there it helps the  animals to dilute the diet to dilute the diet if you have for instance alfalfa as a part of the  mix the animals can can do a little better where our research led us was was to look at again and  
**[0:50:51-0:51:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:50:51):**  i'm not a silver bullet type of person but tannin showed showed up again in this case here that when  livestock and we showed this with sheep and with cattle both when they had access to tannin  containing plants they could utilize much more endophyte infected tofescue with much less  
**[0:51:11-0:51:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:51:11):**  negative kind of effects from the from the fescue and again it was the fact that the tannins were  binding the alkaloids that were in the fescue rendering that negative effect inert basically so  these complementarities and sequences is what we were really getting interested in and that's what  
**[0:51:34-0:51:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:51:34):**  you know i knew michelle mireille and knew of his work but we really bonded when we started down that  path of looking at complementarities and sequences and the shepherds were totally about that in the  work that they were doing complementarities and sequences and mixtures of plants and so forth  
**[0:51:54-0:52:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:51:54):**  so when you consider all these uh you're essentially creating a daily food plan for  a herd as a shepherd by looking at the entire landscape i am curious about your personal  experiences in living with the goats so essentially you were a shepherd you're living with the goats  
**[0:52:10-0:52:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:52:10):**  for four months out of the year and observing them in your undergrad studies um what what came  out of that for you what was unexpected what surprised you i think there were two things that  that really made me stop in my tracks and think one we mentioned already where you know we're  
**[0:52:31-0:52:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:52:31):**  using the goats as mobile pruning machines to stimulate this new growth on black brush which  we knew was more nutritious and yet when it was obvious from the first year we were down there  that the goats i say the goats 80 to 90 percent of the goats didn't want anything to do with the new  
**[0:52:50-0:53:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:52:50):**  twigs 10 to 20 percent they hadn't heard about that they loved them they ate them but most of  the goats they turned their nose up on it and it's like wow what's going on with that and that  opened up so much you know that this whole field of chemical ecology was just starting to to taking  
**[0:53:10-0:53:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:53:10):**  off in those days and here we i linked up with chemical ecologists that i would have never linked  up it would have never happened had those goats not on the the new growth and and we i started  reading in this literature that was talking about plant defenses and that plants protect  
**[0:53:31-0:53:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:53:31):**  protect plant parts and you know it's a big investment to make new new growth twigs on black  brush so black brush produces tannins the bark is like 70 percent tannin and so the the plant is  protecting that investment and that just opened up i started reading in that literature and it  
**[0:53:51-0:54:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:53:51):**  was just the most fascinating thing imaginable to me the going back to what we had talked about  earlier on plant intelligence and and plants participating and and being so involved in in  what's going on and and that can happen in real time where you know within a matter of hours  
**[0:54:12-0:54:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:54:12):**  plants have created compounds that say you know leave me alone don't fool with me anymore i've  had enough enough foraging and so forth so that was one thing that the other thing was that we had  we set up my wife and i had built about two miles of fence in 110 degree temperatures down there  
**[0:54:32-0:54:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:54:32):**  i'll say during the the summer and we set up these six pastures for the goats so we had 15  goats on each of those pastures and in one of the pastures the goats started to eat woodrat houses  and so the goats they're at the base of these juniper trees they build these huge these huge  
**[0:54:53-0:55:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:54:53):**  houses and on the outside of the houses is is bark bark from the juniper so i'm trying to paint  a picture i don't know how to put these big houses at the base of the trees and and and if you start  to look inside those houses and i didn't tear the houses apart to do this but the goats in this one  
**[0:55:11-0:55:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:55:11):**  pasture literally were annihilating these houses and you realize there's different rooms in these  houses and one of the rooms is the bathroom then the houses are densely packed vegetation  needles from the trees and so forth it's just this this monument and the bathrooms in one of  
**[0:55:31-0:55:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:55:31):**  those and it's soaked in urine well that urine soaked vegetation became a protein supplement for  those goats and the goats that were on that that pasture that were eating the woodrat houses fared  far better during that that three-month browsing period than the goats in the other five pastures  
**[0:55:53-0:56:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:55:53):**  but that was it was amazing to me that they did that one and two that the goats and the other  pastures didn't do that and it just made me think about this whole idea of innovation innovation in  animal populations and then how once an innovation like that takes place they're so social they every  
**[0:56:18-0:56:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:56:18):**  goat was doing it you know i often tease people when i'm presenting about this the einstein of the  goat world figured it out and everybody laughs you know however that happened once it did they were  all and maybe they were encouraging one another but they all were doing it and so then you have  
**[0:56:36-0:56:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:56:36):**  then you think generation to generation that becomes a part of the culture of those animals  and this whole notion of animal culture and the livestock producers often talk about the genetics  of their their herds and i appreciate that very much and when i was on the ranch in colorado  
**[0:56:55-0:57:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:56:55):**  the old rancher raised herfords absolutely loved them and took great pride in them but i think what  we miss is this whole culture the culture of these animals and what they've learned and this  gene expression in utero and early in life that that we were talking about that becomes every bit  
**[0:57:15-0:57:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:57:15):**  as important as the genes that the animals bring to bring to the situation and then this these  innovations i just got me thinking about how important innovation is and how once that happens  how it can be maintained within groups of animals simply by culture and this this notion of culture  
**[0:57:41-0:57:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:57:41):**  and then that takes one into this whole and then i'll be quiet for a minute this whole area of  extended families you know if you let livestock go feral they end up in extended families just  like bison and many many other creatures and you start to think about families and extended  
**[0:57:58-0:58:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:57:58):**  families and the roles of different individuals in those families the grandmothers the great  grandmothers the aunts the so forth the young males and then and so forth and you think of the  value of that and i often think nowadays of what we've lost as a human society as we've broken  
**[0:58:20-0:58:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:58:20):**  down families as we no longer have that unit and extended families as a part of of that you know  really when you think about it you take young people and have kids they're too young to know  how to parent they really don't know what the hell they're doing i have to say that's why you  
**[0:58:39-0:59:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:58:39):**  want grandparents and you want extended families and i think of that growing up in that little town  of of salida that was still a part of that we you know the parents were there but the grandparents  were there the great aunts were there and i think back now to how how comforting that was in many  
**[0:59:02-0:59:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:59:02):**  ways and how much what role models those people were and how calming because they've been through  they've been through it they knew you know the parents are busy trying to make a living and  deal with all the kids that that whole business of extended families as a core unit and then  
**[0:59:22-0:59:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:59:22):**  extended families it's not a trivial deal and then so is it any surprise to see that in these  cattle sheep and goats let them go feral they end up in extended families so many wildlife species  of the ungulates anyway that the large herbivores like we were studying they live in extended  
**[0:59:39-1:00:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=0:59:39):**  families and you come to you come to very much appreciate appreciate the functional significance  of that and what that means then as you go across generations and then you know in this book on  shepherding and herding that that i'm alluding to here and that gets brought up time and time  
**[1:00:03-1:00:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:00:03):**  again of the value of those transgenerational linkages to to landscapes and how what how that  makes us locally become we and other creatures locally adapted to and co-evolving with the  landscapes we're inhabiting yeah thank you fred that was really wonderfully expressed i i had the  
**[1:00:26-1:00:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:00:26):**  privilege of growing up in a community where that family culture was valued and continues to be  valued and prioritized and i can still clearly see the value that that brings in in a couple of  different ways one is that as as you mentioned joel salton has this phrase where he describes that we  
**[1:00:46-1:01:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:00:46):**  where he describes that we should be leveraging elderly wisdom with youthful energy and that  multi-generational aspect really allows that to happen where you have the elderly wisdom  but the elderly generation has less energy the youthful generation has the energy and when they  
**[1:01:02-1:01:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:01:02):**  can really collaborate then amazing things can happen from a productivity perspective  but the other piece that i've come to really appreciate about this this strong family culture  is the sense of place and identity that it gives to youth young children young people  
**[1:01:25-1:01:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:01:25):**  they they have a sense a very clear sense of who they are in their environment there is there's not  the the lack of anchoring that sometimes shows up in culture at large that i've observed and i found  that to be really intriguing oh amen to everything that you're saying and to give it currently  
**[1:01:43-1:02:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:01:43):**  a current day example i think that grounding and centering that it's so critical you just can't  get away from it but we have we've broken that i think to a great extent and i was listening to a  commentator who i very much appreciate actually but he was talking about these mass mass shootings  
**[1:02:03-1:02:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:02:03):**  and the young men that are doing you know getting like uvalde that it just happened and he was  talking about facets of that but he was saying in some ways i can't understand you know it's it's  not just mental illness that that's a cop-out on that and i was saying it's hard to understand  
**[1:02:20-1:02:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:02:20):**  while this is happening but it's not hard to understand it's related very much to exactly what  we're talking about right now of that being grounded and centered in place and in community  and being linked with physical and spiritual values whatever that that is in a particular  
**[1:02:40-1:03:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:02:40):**  but that grounding and centering is absolutely critical for for for mental mental and physical  and spiritual health all three of those it's when you break those linkages then you're  you know the the society's breakdown i it's just fundamental and it may sound old school or  
**[1:03:00-1:03:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:03:00):**  whatever it sounds but it's just it's it's a fundamental part and you know what have we lost  then in our the animals in our care when we if we don't even have it in our own societies  why would we ever think about that in in the animals in our care but what do you lose there's  
**[1:03:19-1:03:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:03:19):**  a lady in tasmania nan brea is her name you know i used to teach a two-week short course very much  hands-on at utah state university during the summer and as it went along nrcs sponsored it  but we'd have people from all over the world over it was taught over like 30 year period  
**[1:03:37-1:03:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:03:37):**  we'd have people from all over and we'd be doing hands-on so we're talking about food selection and  habitat selection not so much but these things and we would be having those people hands-on involved  doing things young learning from mother it was amazing when they would do you know you train the  
**[1:03:55-1:04:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:03:55):**  young animals the mother to eat one thing avoid another thing then you'd you'd show them these the  the hands-on involvement makes things come alive right it makes it's not just words anymore you're  hands-on involved and participating and you know all that then gets linked in with what  
**[1:04:15-1:04:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:04:15):**  we're talking about on these transgenerational linkages to the to the landscapes that we inhabit  yeah you know when you speak about culture the culture of a society of a group of people of a  community the culture of a group of animals there are almost an infinite infinite number of  
**[1:04:37-1:04:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:04:37):**  variations that can exist in culture you can have strong culture that has widely widely variable  widely widely variable but when you lose the connection or what i called the anchoring so when  you have a strong culture you could almost call that a coherent culture when you lose that anchoring  
**[1:04:56-1:05:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:04:56):**  then the absence of a coherent culture you get no culture which is chaos and so when you think about  our the livestock patterns or even in our society as you were describing this we we have all this  chaotic intermingling and a lack of sense of identity lack of sense of place and it's it's  
**[1:05:17-1:05:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:05:17):**  really intriguing for me to think about that from a livestock management perspective i have not  considered that in the past and it's the one experience that i've had that has really stood  out to me i've had the privilege of traveling widely and meeting with groups of people in many  
**[1:05:33-1:05:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:05:33):**  different places and without question when there are multiple generations living in the same place  for extended periods of time when farmers talk about being the fourth generation or the fifth  generation of the farm there is a degree there of becoming indigenous how do you become indigenous  
**[1:05:53-1:06:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:05:53):**  to the landscape and when that happens it becomes very clear how people adapt or adopt the  personality of the landscape to some degree if you have harsh rugged landscapes you develop harsh  rugged cultures with harsh rugged individuals it's really intriguing i was had an interesting  
**[1:06:16-1:06:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:06:16):**  meeting at one geographic location once and i returned home and i told my wife i think that  this entire culture has developed calcified thinking because they're in a very calcareous  environment and there was there was a lot of uh just a pronounced inability even though there  
**[1:06:36-1:06:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:06:36):**  was the expressed desire there was an inability to grasp new concepts and new ideas that was quite  profound it was it was quite disconcerting to watch people express the desire to learn something  new but not be able to wrap their minds around it and not just one or two individuals but as a group  
**[1:06:53-1:07:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:06:53):**  and so anyway i'm i feel like i'm just rambling on here but i'd love to get your your response  no you're not it is it is fascinating though and it brings to mind an example you know when we were  last 10 years i was at utah state university we had a program called behave which was really  
**[1:07:13-1:07:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:07:13):**  taking principles and processes that we've been studying working with and working with with  livestock producers around the country and around the world as it turned out to to try to think  about how to implement those but one of the groups we ended up working very closely with was ted  
**[1:07:29-1:07:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:07:29):**  turner's ted turner and i don't know if the listeners know or not but ted became very  interested in bison as a native animal species and trying to to move back to a native kind of ecosystem  so he purchased tremendous amount of land over the years and i think now they have like 50 000 bison  
**[1:07:51-1:08:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:07:51):**  that are that are under their their management on these landscapes that out in the midwest and and  throughout the west but amazing ranches amazing management that takes place but you know most  bison have cattle genetics have they're not pure bison they have cattle genetics  
**[1:08:11-1:08:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:08:11):**  and it's very rare to find a herd that doesn't well they're one of their ranches is down in in  new mexico and there was a herd of bison on there that they were ready to get rid of actually it was  kind of scrawny not the best looking kind of bison at all and they were they were having their bison  
**[1:08:30-1:08:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:08:30):**  tested dna analyzed by some researchers at texas a and m university they were working with different  herds and it was just literally as they tell the story anyway the day before they were ready to  ship them get slaughter get rid of them all and the geneticist said no no no no don't do that  
**[1:08:48-1:09:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:08:48):**  these are pure bison they have no cattle genetics no cattle integration why did they look scrawny  and and not like some of the bison up here they're down there on those harsh landscapes in the arid  southwest and they're reflecting kind of the quote calcified that's you know they're like those  
**[1:09:09-1:09:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:09:09):**  cattle that were down there in southern utah they're not huge frame size they're they're  their body size is adapted to the landscapes where they're where they're inhabiting right  they're they're co-evolved with that so long-winded but a story that goes along and that's  
**[1:09:27-1:09:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:09:27):**  it's true what you say you have this infinite kind of variations on on cultural themes  and and and what comes about in those different cultures and subcultures and the more you look  into that the more i'm thinking of wildlife examples too of the innovation that that happens  
**[1:09:47-1:10:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:09:47):**  and then becomes a part of that culture makes that that culture you absolutely unique and  amazing in in its own ways even if it is calcified or what it's all all part of the manifestation  right so fred you've had the opportunity of working with many leaders and innovators from  
**[1:10:09-1:10:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:10:09):**  around the world and we have many listeners here to the podcast from from all over the world and  from particularly here in north america and australia and so forth what is something that  you wish all farmers knew what what is uh where can people follow up from our conversation to  
**[1:10:26-1:10:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:10:26):**  learn more that's one question and the second question is what is a valuable piece of  information that you think it would benefit everyone to know uh good good question you're  gonna put links out there to some of the materials like the book and so forth i also mentioned that  
**[1:10:44-1:11:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:10:44):**  there'll be an audio book of nourishment coming out right away and it it doesn't have the detail  i cut the uh you know it's roughly 155 000 words in nourishment i cut it to 75 000 words to get  rid of the detail so i think for some folks there's too much detail in that that book too much  
**[1:11:04-1:11:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:11:04):**  the audiobook's going to be more more big picture big picture related to that so that's going to be  another source of of information if people want to just listen and and not have to to read and so  forth so that's that's materials we for people who really want to go into things we published  
**[1:11:23-1:11:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:11:23):**  like 300 papers over the years and many many popular kinds of things that that help people  get get their their heads around this and done many many uh even in the last year many many  extended workshops and master classes for different groups that are accessible so then the  
**[1:11:42-1:12:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:11:42):**  question what what would you what what would you want people to that's a hard question i think for  me john i think i would say follow your hearts follow your heart find what it is in you that  you're that's your passion and follow that and don't let anybody interfere with that and you'll  
**[1:12:03-1:12:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:12:03):**  have a wonderful wonderful life if you're young or if you're old or whatever follow what's every  one of us is unique just find that and follow that physically spiritually there's something  in you that knows it's at that deep at that that that deep level and it's not involving thought  
**[1:12:25-1:12:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:12:25):**  you know um i'm gonna read you a short thing that's in that audiobook that just relates to that  because i i think about it a lot and i think you probably think about it a lot too but what i want  to say is thinking plays a subordinate role in the creativity of eminent scientists and that was  
**[1:12:45-1:13:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:12:45):**  disclosed in a national survey to discover their working methods their creative breakthroughs come  during mental quietude when we become quiet when we when we shut down all the noise ironically the  reason many scientists aren't creative isn't because they don't know how to think it's because  
**[1:13:04-1:13:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:13:04):**  they don't know how to stop thinking and reside in the intuitive stillness within and i'm saying  scientists let's say for everyone right it's for for all of us uh albert einstein called the inner  stillness of our intuitive self a sacred gift the rational mind a faithful servant i'd say now to  
**[1:13:24-1:13:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:13:24):**  our great detriment we worship the servant and defile the gift it's that intuitive that part  that's deep within us that just it knows i don't know how it no it's linked with it's linked with  whatever one wants to call that the absolute being god whatever that's where we i very much  
**[1:13:45-1:14:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:13:45):**  believe with one with that and so follow that you know and follow there there's a key phrase there  there's a key phrase there thank you fred that was wonderfully expressed follow that see following  is doing you have to actually we we need to listen to this inner awareness follow your passions  
**[1:14:07-1:14:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:14:07):**  and then actually engage and i want to share this with with all of our listeners we have  we have many listeners for to the podcast and to the webinars that we produce that we're we're  grateful for all of you and for the change that you're bringing about in the world and it's it is  
**[1:14:25-1:14:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:14:25):**  necessary and valuable and powerful for all of us to inspire each other to share information to share  what we have learned but we also need to recognize that we only begin to change the world when we  manifest that when we put it into actual action when we begin applying and implementing what it  
**[1:14:44-1:15:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-81-fred-provenza#t=1:14:44):**  is that we know and i've had several conversations recently with people who have expressed that  they've listened to lots of the podcasts but they're not really familiar with the work that  we do and so i would ask all of you to reach out to us to our team at advancing eco agriculture

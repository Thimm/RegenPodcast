**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:43):**  that studies erosion.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:44):**  I study what shapes the surface of the earth.

**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:55):**  but mostly from a very long-term perspective,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:58):**  how it shapes the surface of the world  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:00):**  that we know and walk around on.

**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:06):**  the Dirt, the Erosion, and the Civilizations book,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:08):**  the first book I wrote that dealt with soils.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:11):**  It was an attempt to try and bridge my interest  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:14):**  in landscape evolution and how erosion works,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:16):**  and my training and background in that,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:18):**  with thinking about the way that soil erosion  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:21):**  had affected ancient civilizations.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:23):**  I thought it would be a great way to visit places  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:26):**  around the world that visit ancient societies  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:29):**  and bring my training to bear on what I thought  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:31):**  would be an intellectually interesting story.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:34):**  And it turned out that as I was writing that book,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:36):**  I ended up writing a book about the history of farming,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:39):**  because that's really where the connection  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:42):**  between soil erosion, soil degradation,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:45):**  over the long-term connects back to human societies.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:48):**  The story really was one of how farming practices  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:51):**  had affected the fertility of the land  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:53):**  over millennia and generations,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:55):**  and how that had affected human societies.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:57):**  So I started from this big picture, long-term perspective,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:02):**  looking at how agriculture has influenced people  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:05):**  in sort of a slightly different way  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:06):**  than we normally think about.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:08):**  And that started me on the road  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:10):**  to where I've eventually ended up today,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:12):**  is thinking about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:14):**  as a way to solve the problems that I was talking about  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:18):**  and identified in the dirt book.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:19):**  So I came at regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:21):**  kind of from a different angle  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:23):**  than I think most people come to it from,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:25):**  but it's been a very illuminating journey for me.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:28):**  And I hope for readers along the way  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:30):**  that have sort of shared in my growth and education  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:34):**  as I've looked into this.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:37):**  David, you're speaking about erosion  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:40):**  as being a primary problem.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:42):**  And I heard a data point a couple of years ago  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:45):**  that really caught my attention  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:46):**  that the state of Iowa loses two pounds of topsoil  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:50):**  for every pound of corn produced.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:53):**  You know, how is that gonna last, right?  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah, and we've already degraded something like a third  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:02):**  of the world's agricultural land to the point  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:04):**  where it's not really being used commercially  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:06):**  for agriculture.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:07):**  And we're on the path to do another 30% or so  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:11):**  this century according to the UN's 2015  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:14):**  Global State of the Soil Report.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:16):**  For basically losing the soil  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:19):**  through the ways that we grow our food,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:21):**  then we're effectively mining the soil  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:23):**  to feed ourselves today.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:25):**  And I mean, one of the most amazing things about the soil  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:29):**  as a physical entity on earth  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:31):**  is that it's naturally renewable.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:32):**  It's a very renewable resource if we steward it  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:35):**  and shepherd it and take care of it.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:37):**  But it's also mineable if we use it faster  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:40):**  than we're regenerating it.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:43):**  We can quite literally run out of it.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:45):**  And societies in different parts of the world  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:47):**  have done that in the past.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:48):**  And we're, as your story from Iowa illustrates,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:51):**  we're on track to do that again  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:53):**  with a roast of farming practices today.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:55):**  Yet we've made great strides as well.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:58):**  And I've turned from something of a pessimist  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:00):**  into something of an unrepentant optimist on this issue.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:03):**  I think we can actually solve this problem.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:06):**  That's what the whole revolution book was about.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:08):**  But yeah, those statistics like you were just citing  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:10):**  are those kinds of things that slap you in the face  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:12):**  and go, wow, something's got to change here.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:16):**  When you think about shifting from a pessimist to an optimist  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:19):**  one of the questions that comes to my mind is  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:21):**  how big is the problem really?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:22):**  Isn't the problem inflated?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:25):**  Well, there's actually sort of two dimensions  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:27):**  to the problem.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:28):**  And some people will have the problem  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:31):**  in the public sphere has been inflated to some degree.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:33):**  There's a series of articles that made the rounds  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:36):**  I think a few years ago where someone was saying,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:39):**  someone at the UN said,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:40):**  we're gonna totally run out of soil in 60 years.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:43):**  That's not gonna happen.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:47):**  But we are on track to degrade enough of it  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:50):**  that it will impact our ability to feed people.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:52):**  That part's true.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:53):**  But there's really two dimensions  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:55):**  to the soil degradation problem.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:56):**  One is the actual erosion and loss of the soil.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:58):**  And that's a bigger problem in some parts of the world  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:01):**  than others.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:02):**  But the other part is the degradation  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:04):**  of the fertility of the soil,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:05):**  the loss of soil organic matter.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:07):**  And whether you look across the US as a whole or globally,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:12):**  the estimates are we've degraded something like half  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:15):**  of the soil organic matter from our agricultural fields.

**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:25):**  that whole underground biological economy going,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:29):**  that's real cause for concern.

**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:35):**  you basically become hooked on relying on agrochemicals  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:40):**  to maintain agricultural production.

**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:48):**  all these problems compound in terms

**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:57):**  has been somewhat inflated.

**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:01):**  and a really key problem to why it's been so difficult  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:05):**  to solve is that it happens relatively slowly.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:08):**  It's a problem that plays out over decades and centuries.

**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:18):**  because they don't always rise to the crisis de jour.

**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:28):**  over the last several centuries,

**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:37):**  What's the pathway to correcting the problem?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:40):**  Boy, yeah, if you'd asked me 10 years ago  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:44):**  when I was finishing the dirt book,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:45):**  if I'd become an unrepentant optimist on this issue,

**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:50):**  I struggled really hard with how to write  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:52):**  the last chapter of that book.

**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:56):**  was my third attempt because the first two  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:58):**  were too depressing for me to want  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:01):**  actually put out there in the world.

**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:05):**  is I recommended essentially trying to figure out  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:07):**  how to get no-till farming and organic farming  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:10):**  to work together, which was a real challenge  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:13):**  in terms of weed control and organic systems  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:15):**  and how to use no-till systems without the herbicides  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:19):**  that 10 years ago were so essential

**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:28):**  was actually going out over the next five years or so  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:31):**  after that book came out and speaking at conferences  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:34):**  where farmers were speaking.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:35):**  And I'd be asked to give a talk  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:37):**  on the history of soil erosion

**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:41):**  But I would also then attend the conference

**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:45):**  from people like Gabe Brown and Duane Beck,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:47):**  people who were farmers who had restored fertility  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:51):**  to very degraded land.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:52):**  And they did it through intensive agriculture,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:55):**  through practices that were growing a lot of food  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:58):**  but that were rebuilding the health  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:00):**  and fertility of their soil.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:02):**  And I started thinking, oh,  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:03):**  I need to go visit some of these guys.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:05):**  I need to look at their farms, dig holes in their farms,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:08):**  dig holes in their neighbors' farms,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:09):**  think about what's happening to the soil  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:10):**  and find out what are the real sort of tricks  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:13):**  and secrets behind what they're doing.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:16):**  And part of what catalyzed me into going off  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:19):**  and taking six months to travel around the world  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:21):**  and interview farmers like that was at the same time  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:24):**  as I was finishing the dirt book,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:26):**  my wife who's a gardener, she's a biologist  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:29):**  and a major league gardener.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:31):**  We'd bought a house in North Seattle  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:33):**  and she took on a project to restore the soil in our yard.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:37):**  And she did it far faster than I could have guessed  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:41):**  that it would have happened.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:42):**  Within four or five years of her intensive composting  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:46):**  and mulching and returning organic matter  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:48):**  to the soil in our yard,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:49):**  we're starting to see the soil change color,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:51):**  the soil came back to life,

**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:56):**  and what turned out to be pretty much the same order  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:59):**  in which life evolved on earth from microbes to arachnids

**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:08):**  all the way up to an eagle that ate the baby crow  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:11):**  that was eating the worms  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:12):**  that were eating the organic matter that Anne added  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:14):**  to the yard.

**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:17):**  and added the human cherry on top.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:23):**  But you're seeing our soil in our yard come back to life  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:27):**  so fast, in less than a decade,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:29):**  going from less than 1% organic matter  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:31):**  up to about 8 to 10% across the yard.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:34):**  And just the transformative effect  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:36):**  that it had on the above ground biology  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:38):**  really started me thinking and Anne thinking about,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:41):**  wow, could you do this at scale on real farms?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:44):**  And that's where having seen these talks  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:46):**  by the Gabe Browns of the world  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:47):**  and the Dwayne Becks of the world  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:49):**  sort of set me off on a path to ask,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:51):**  well, could you do on farms  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:54):**  with commercially viable agriculture  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:56):**  what Anne had done in our yard with a very souped up hobby  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:01):**  in terms of gardening in her case.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:04):**  And I started learning from regenerative farmers  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:07):**  who had decades of experience  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:09):**  in tinkering around with their methods  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:11):**  and how they would actually rebuild  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:13):**  the fertility of their soil.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:14):**  And I'm kind of a synthesizer.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:17):**  I like to look for patterns and draw the generalities out.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:20):**  And so I traveled around talking to farmers like that  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:24):**  and then stood back and asked the question of,  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:27):**  what did all these people have in common?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:29):**  What was the framework?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:30):**  And it lines up really well with what we think of today  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:33):**  as regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:35):**  David, that is perfect.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:36):**  That's exactly the place that I was hoping to go next.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:39):**  What we've observed in our work  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:41):**  at Advancing Eco-Agriculture is exceptional instances  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:45):**  where soils, even under commercial cropping  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:47):**  production systems are gaining as much  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:49):**  as a half a percentage point of organic matter per year.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:52):**  And there is this constant question that keeps coming up is,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:55):**  is that repeatable?  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:57):**  Can we do that consistently?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:58):**  Can we do it on a large scale?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:01):**  So within that context, what are the tools and practices  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:05):**  that growers were using to deliver  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:07):**  those results consistently?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:09):**  Well, you know, there was a consistent set of principles  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:13):**  that tracked across all the really successful ones  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:16):**  I visited and they may not be the only principles out there  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:19):**  that would work, but they worked in these cases.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:22):**  But the actual practices that the people used  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:24):**  in different regions were completely different.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:26):**  So those principles were things like, you know,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:29):**  don't disturb the ground surface.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:30):**  So it was minimal disturbance, no till practices,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:34):**  or a minimum of surficial disturbance  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:37):**  in terms of light disking or stuff.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:39):**  But everyone that I visited who was very successful  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:41):**  had gone the no disturbance route  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:43):**  in one sort of variety of no till or another.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:45):**  They all kept the ground surface covered.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:48):**  They all planted cover crops.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:50):**  So there was a living plant in the soil at all times.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:52):**  It was sort of the don't farm naked kind of philosophy.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:56):**  And the third one was that they all had rotations  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:00):**  or diversity in their cover crops  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:02):**  that were more than about four crops.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:04):**  So it was a complex rotation, much more complex  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:07):**  than say, you know, corn, corn, corn, or corn and soybeans.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:11):**  I think that's the antithesis of complexity.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:15):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:17):**  I like to say that corn and soybeans is not a rotation.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:20):**  So it's, you know, with those things  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:21):**  in terms of minimal disturbance,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:23):**  keeping cover crops and diversity,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:25):**  that was the foundation that was really across the board.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:28):**  Some of the people I visited  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:30):**  were reintroducing animal agriculture  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:32):**  and reintegrating it with their cropping systems.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:34):**  And I came to view that as not an essential element  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:38):**  of soil restoration, but something that has the potential  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:41):**  to be a tremendous accelerator in the sense that,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:45):**  say you bring in cattle to graze off a cover crop,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:49):**  then by using the cattle to terminate the cover crop,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:52):**  you're accelerating the breakdown of the cover crop  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:55):**  back into soluble forms of nutrients  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:58):**  that the plant can take back up  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:59):**  because what comes out in the manure  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:02):**  is more processed and broken down and full of microbes  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:04):**  than just leaving the stalks on the surface of the ground.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:09):**  So, you know, and at the highest level,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:11):**  what really seemed to be the root of regenerative farming,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:15):**  that, you know, farming practices that work  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:16):**  to regenerate the fertility of the soil  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:19):**  were a system that would cultivate  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:21):**  the beneficial life in the soil.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:24):**  And if you think about sort of the dominant way  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:28):**  that we've looked at agriculture  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:30):**  in the conventional world for the last century,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:33):**  it's been about how do we sort of manage  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:35):**  or kill the things we don't want on the fields  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:38):**  rather than how do we cultivate the kind of conditions  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:41):**  for life in the soil that will help our crops thrive  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:45):**  using their own natural defense systems  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:47):**  and their partners, their allies, if you will,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:51):**  in the root zone, the bacteria and the fungi  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:54):**  that work in conjunction with plants  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:57):**  and the kind of mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:00):**  that Ann and I wrote about in The Hidden Half of Nature.

**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:04):**  to try and actually promote and cultivate the beneficial life  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:08):**  in the soil.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:09):**  But if you look at the kind of principles  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:13):**  of ditch the plow, cover up and grow diversity  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:16):**  that are behind those three big  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:17):**  conservation agriculture principles,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:20):**  that's about 180 degree philosophical shift  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:23):**  from what we've been teaching people in ag schools  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:26):**  for the last 80 years as the backbone  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:29):**  of conventional farming where it was heavy tillage  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:32):**  with lots of agrochemicals  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:33):**  and specializing in one or two crops.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:37):**  So the real key seemed to be, first of all,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:41):**  thinking about the place of the soil really differently  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:44):**  in our philosophy of farming  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:46):**  and then layering on the practices  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:49):**  that cultivate the beneficial life in the soil.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:53):**  David, in the conversations that you've had with farmers  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:55):**  and the conversations that I've had with growers  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:58):**  and agronomists, I find the perspective  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:02):**  that you expressed on livestock to be a common theme.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:06):**  Generally, the really successful agronomists and growers  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:09):**  who are regenerating soil health  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:12):**  are incorporating livestock into the ecosystem  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:15):**  in some manner, if at all possible.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:17):**  It's not always, but if possible,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:18):**  they're incorporating them.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:20):**  And I find that this is a commonly held perspective  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:23):**  and it is completely contrary  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:25):**  to the celebrity perspective of veganism being,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:30):**  vegan diets and no meat diets  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:33):**  being the solution to climate change.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah, no, I've been working on a textbook on sustainability  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:41):**  for my publisher for the last five years.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:43):**  So we're almost done,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:45):**  but we've been trying to integrate the sort of social science  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:48):**  and biological and physical science  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:51):**  at an introductory level for all those things.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:53):**  And one of the most challenging bits of that  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:55):**  was taking the sort of the draft parts  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:58):**  on agriculture that dealt with livestock  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:03):**  and its place in sustainability for that very reason,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:05):**  because the sort of the go-to,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:07):**  as you put it, you put the celebrity perspective of,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:10):**  you know, we must go vegetarian to save the world.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:15):**  You know, it actually really depends,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:16):**  I think a lot on how livestock is raised  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:19):**  as to what their net environmental impact actually is.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:23):**  And this is where my own thinking has evolved quite a lot  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:25):**  over the last 10 years,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:27):**  because when I was finishing the dirt book,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:29):**  there's lots of examples historically where overgrazing  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:32):**  didn't destroy the soil,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:33):**  but it kept the soil from rebuilding.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:36):**  And there's places where it caused gullies,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:38):**  you know, the Southwest of California,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:41):**  good places where it's been well demonstrated  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:43):**  that if you graze livestock for too long  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:46):**  in the same place in the valley bottoms in a landscape  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:48):**  where that's where the only water is,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:50):**  it causes a royals, gullies to develop.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:53):**  So I came to the problem of animals  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:56):**  and agriculture from that perspective.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:58):**  Oh, cows are bad, they cause erosion.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:00):**  But seeing people who had actually used their livestock  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:03):**  in different ways, and as actually as a tool  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:05):**  of soil rebuilding, as in effect  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:08):**  as self-propelled methane digesters  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:10):**  that can convert cover crops into manure,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:14):**  and thereby accelerate the cycling of nutrients in the soil,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:18):**  and seeing people have had success turning, you know,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:21):**  one or 2% organic matter soils into much richer,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:24):**  you know, 5%, 6%, 8% organic matter soils  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:27):**  over the course of, you know, a decade or so,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:32):**  convinced me that there's a different way  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:34):**  to look at livestock in the whole agricultural equation.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:37):**  And so I think we can point, we can certainly point  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:40):**  to the adverse environmental impacts  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:42):**  of, you know, confined animal feeding operations,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:45):**  CAFOs, where we feed livestock corn grown  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:50):**  with conventional practices, mining the soil,  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:54):**  and using a lot of fossil fuels to then, you know,  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:56):**  take that 10 to one hit on the food chain,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:59):**  where you're spending 10 times the energy  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:01):**  to get something for that next trophic level,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:05):**  it's not a very efficient way overall  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:08):**  to generate calories for people.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:09):**  And so in that sense, you know,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:11):**  the celebrity perspective has some legs on it.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:13):**  The way we tend to grow livestock  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:16):**  is not a great environmentally.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:19):**  But if you turn around and look at, oh,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:22):**  well, there's all these great areas of the world  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:23):**  that are grasslands and seminary grassland environments,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:27):**  where moisture is a big challenge  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:30):**  in terms of growing a lot of crops,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:32):**  and conventional practices are erosive.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:36):**  And you look at, well, how what's the best way  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:38):**  to use those landscapes to feed people?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:40):**  And, you know, cows do this amazing thing  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:43):**  of turning grass, something we can't eat,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:45):**  and which grows over, you know,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:47):**  what, a quarter of the continents or something,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:51):**  into product, cattle will turn that into,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:53):**  you know, meat and dairy that we actually can eat.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:56):**  And if you integrate them back with cropping,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:58):**  they can actually help sustain the fertility of the land.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:00):**  So my perspective on the whole livestock issue these days  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:04):**  has changed radically.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:05):**  And I'm convinced that livestock can be a component  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:09):**  of soil restoration and regeneration,  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:11):**  but it's all about how we manage the livestock.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:14):**  The problem's not the livestock,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:15):**  the problem is what we do with the livestock.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:18):**  Very well spoken.

**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:32):**  of many geologists that it takes a really long time  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:36):**  to build soils.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:38):**  So as a reformed geologist,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:41):**  and now that you've had conversations

**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:44):**  what are the realistic expectations?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:46):**  How rapidly can we rebuild soil health?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:48):**  And what should we be striving for?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:52):**  You know, you've just hit on half of the equation  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:54):**  that turned me into an optimist on this issue,  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:56):**  because if you go back to sort of a basic geology textbook,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:00):**  say, you'll find, or if you even actually just measure  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:03):**  the rate at which nature builds soils,

**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:09):**  to build an inch of fertile soil.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:11):**  And, you know, credible estimates for how fast nature  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:14):**  builds soil on average on the planet, you know,  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:16):**  500 to 1,000 years per inch is probably a decent average.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:20):**  But, you know, it's highly variable,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:22):**  there's lots of different environments in the world.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:23):**  But that rate presumes you're taking a rock  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:28):**  and turning it into soil.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:30):**  And, you know, I've got rocks all over my garden,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:33):**  that are all over my wife's garden  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:35):**  that I've brought home from all over the world.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:37):**  And they don't break down very fast,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:39):**  even here in the Northwest where it rains all the time.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:42):**  Rocks are pretty stable.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:43):**  It takes centuries to millennia to break a rock down  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:46):**  and turn it into soil.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:48):**  But one of the things that Ann taught me  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:51):**  with the lesson of the garden,  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:53):**  was that if you already have the mineral matter,  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:55):**  and in our yard we had ground up bits  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:58):**  of British Columbia granite that a glacier delivered  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:02):**  down to Seattle 15,000 years ago.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:04):**  So we had the mineral part of soil.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:06):**  It was all broken up, or you can dig it up.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:10):**  What we didn't have was the organic matter.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:12):**  We didn't have the biology.

**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:15):**  And it turns out that you can restore,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:17):**  the key to restoring soil fertility rapidly,  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:21):**  isn't thinking about making it from scratch.

**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:32):**  If you've got to wait to break down  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:34):**  a piece of granite into sand,

**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:38):**  But if you're basically trying to figure out  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:42):**  how do you get organic matter  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:43):**  into the broken up mineral particles of a soil  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:48):**  where the rocks have already been crushed up,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:50):**  you can actually do it real fast.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:51):**  And that's where the rates of a quarter to a third  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:57):**  to even a half a percent organic matter increase per year

**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:08):**  and bring life literally back to the soil.

**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:13):**  bringing our soils back to life.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:15):**  It is meant to be taken literally,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:17):**  putting life back in the soil  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:19):**  is the key to rebuilding soil quite rapidly.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:23):**  And by quite rapidly, I'm a geologist,

**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:29):**  That could be, could test the patience

**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:05):**  range, even at what could be a very feasible and low rate

**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:10):**  And at the high end,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:11):**  with the examples you were talking about earlier,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:13):**  about a half a percent or so a year,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:15):**  if I recall what you're saying,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:16):**  that's sort of at the high end of the examples  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:18):**  I saw as well, I think it's feasible.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:21):**  And the reason I think it's feasible  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:22):**  is because I've seen people that have done it.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:25):**  And I'm an empiricist, if it's been done, it can be done.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah, it has been done.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:30):**  And it's been done on a substantial scale,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:32):**  on a scale of thousands of acres,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:33):**  which I think answers about whether it's scalable.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:36):**  Yeah, oh yeah.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:36):**  And that's one of the big revelations to me  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:38):**  in growing a revolution was that it's,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:40):**  these principles are totally scalable.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:42):**  The practices you would use to scale them may vary,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:45):**  depending on where you are in the world  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:46):**  and what kind of technology people have available.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:49):**  But they scale.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:50):**  It's not just something for backyard gardens.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:52):**  There's the biggest farms I was looking at  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:54):**  were like 20,000 acres,  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:56):**  which to me is a large, you know,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:59):**  that's probably about the size of the city of Seattle.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:04):**  David, you've approached agriculture  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:07):**  from a very different perspective,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:09):**  the perspective that as growers and agronomists,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:11):**  we don't often get to think about a great deal.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:16):**  When you think about modern agriculture,  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:18):**  agriculture as it has developed today,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:21):**  what do you believe to be true about modern agriculture  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:24):**  that is perhaps different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:27):**  Oh boy, you know, one of the biggest things that I run,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:35):**  I just keep running into and dealing with people  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:37):**  in the mainstream media are the idea  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:40):**  that we have a choice between sort of  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:42):**  environmentally friendly agriculture and feeding the world.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:45):**  That if we go organic, say,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:48):**  that we will all starve to death.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:51):**  And I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:54):**  that's out there.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:55):**  And I know that people in the regenerative agriculture space  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:58):**  probably aren't in that zone of misconception,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:01):**  but it's a pretty big pool of misconception out there.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:04):**  And so I actually think that the key  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:07):**  to sustaining long-term farming is through restoring  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:13):**  and accelerating the natural cycles of growth and decay  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:17):**  and recycling the way that soils have worked  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:20):**  for 450 million years.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:23):**  And that we need to work with those systems  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:25):**  rather than try and manipulate and alter those systems.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:29):**  I think that in the 20th century,  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:32):**  with the rise of what we now consider  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:33):**  conventional agriculture, but which is actually brand new,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:37):**  if you look at it in the big sweep of things.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:39):**  It should be considered alternative agriculture.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:42):**  Yeah, it should be considered, you know,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:44):**  that experiment we did in the 20th century.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:47):**  And we should be asking how well did it work?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:49):**  And at one level it worked really well to increase crop  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:53):**  yields, but it also degraded a lot of our land  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:56):**  and our future ability to grow crops.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:00):**  And there's questions about what it did to the quality  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:01):**  of the food that we eat as well,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:03):**  and the nutrient density of foods.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:07):**  So David, you've spoken with growers  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:09):**  from all over the world.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:10):**  You've written three different books,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:12):**  which I highly encourage everyone to read,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:15):**  particularly the last, Growing a Revolution.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:17):**  Once I started reading it, didn't stop until I was finished.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:20):**  So it's a very enlightening read.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:22):**  Oh, thank you.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:23):**  With this entire pathway that you've been on,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:29):**  what has been something that has surprised you the most?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:32):**  What was the most unexpected?  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:35):**  Well, you know, really the single most unexpected thing  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:39):**  was how fast Anne restored the soil in our yard.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:42):**  That was a total eye-opener to me,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:44):**  because I was coming at it from this,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:46):**  it takes centuries to millennia to grow an inch of soil  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:50):**  kind of perspective.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:51):**  And right under my nose in the backyard,  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:53):**  she demonstrated that she could basically turn that around.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:57):**  And she grew several inches of soil in less than five years.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:01):**  And I was just like, you know,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:02):**  there's nothing in the journals that says you can do this.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:05):**  This is like way too fast.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:08):**  And that was one of those sort of light bulb moments.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:11):**  I remember the first time she and I sort of realized that,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:14):**  wow, our soil is changing really fast,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:17):**  was when she had a plant that she wanted to transplant  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:19):**  from one place to another.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:21):**  She'd like planted it in what she declared a few years later  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:23):**  to be the wrong spot.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:24):**  Plant wasn't happy, needed to move.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:25):**  So we dug a hole to move it out.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:27):**  And it was, I think it was about four years  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:30):**  after she started her organic matter crusade  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:33):**  to restore the soil in the yard.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:35):**  And we noticed that, wow,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:35):**  we've got a couple inches of soil here  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:37):**  that wasn't there when we started the yard.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:40):**  And that was just total eye-opener moment.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:45):**  The other kind of eye-opener moments were,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:48):**  I think a big one for me was going to the World Congress  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:53):**  on Conservation Agriculture in 2014,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:56):**  because I saw a series of farmers speak there  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:58):**  who really sparked the idea in my mind to,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:02):**  I should go visit some of these people  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:04):**  and see their farms and see what I was thinking of,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:07):**  you know, have they done on their farm  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:08):**  what Ann did in our yard?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:10):**  And making that connection was sort of a leap up for me  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:14):**  in terms of, oh, how do you scale these things?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:18):**  Could you actually do what Ann did,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:20):**  but do it on commercial farms at scale  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:23):**  in both the developed and developing world?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:25):**  So those two sort of moments were things  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:28):**  where they set me off on the course that ended up,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:32):**  that culminated in writing Growing Revolution.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:36):**  What didn't make it into the book?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:38):**  There's always, every time I write a little bit,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:42):**  and I know that there's always things  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:44):**  that you want to put in that don't make it,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:46):**  so I'm curious, what was that for you?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:49):**  There were hundreds of pages that didn't make it in.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:51):**  I've got these files full of stuff  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:53):**  that I haven't made into one book or another,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:55):**  but there's a couple things that we thought about  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:57):**  putting into Hidden Affinature, didn't make it in there.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:00):**  We thought, I thought about doing it in Growing Revolution,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:02):**  didn't make it in there, but one of them is  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:04):**  we have a huge file on glyphosate,  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:08):**  and we wrote a bit about glyphosate in both books,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:11):**  but not very much, because we were trying to wade through  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:14):**  the sort of the science, and it didn't get comfortable  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:17):**  until fairly recently with how we sort of think about that,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:21):**  and didn't want to commit in writing  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:24):**  before I was comfortable that I understood the science  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:26):**  enough to know what I was, at least to think  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:28):**  I knew what I was saying.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:30):**  And so sort of wrestling with the role of glyphosate  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:33):**  as a disruptor of the microbiome,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:35):**  the sort of life in the soil,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:36):**  and in the gut of livestock and people,  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:39):**  was something that didn't make it in,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:41):**  because we didn't think we could support the argument  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:44):**  to the extent that, that now in hindsight  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:47):**  I think is warranted.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:48):**  So Anne and I are working on a new book now  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:50):**  that that stuff may end up getting into.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:53):**  And there was also a trip to South Africa  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:56):**  that did not make it into Growing Revolution.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:00):**  It was to visit a really progressive farm in South Africa,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:03):**  but when the key agronomist wasn't on site when I was there,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:06):**  and so I couldn't interview him,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:08):**  and I just couldn't connect all the dots,  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:10):**  it would have made a great story.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:12):**  Maybe someday I'll do a magazine piece on it,  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:14):**  because this farmer was keeping cheetahs  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:18):**  in his crop circles in South Africa,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:20):**  and he had livestock that instead of using cows  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:25):**  the way North American regenerative farmers were,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:27):**  he was using native South African species  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:31):**  of grazing ungulates to graze off his cover crops,  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:35):**  and then he had cheetahs that would hunt the grazers.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:38):**  And so he had big barbed wire fences  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:41):**  around his crop circles saying, do not enter.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:45):**  But that does sound like a fascinating story.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:47):**  Was he using the cheetahs to keep the animals grouped?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:49):**  No, he was using the cheetahs  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:50):**  because he was very much into cheetah conservation,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:54):**  and it was as a rehabilitation area for cheetahs  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:57):**  that had been displaced or injured in the wild.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:02):**  So it was sort of this complicated story  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:04):**  of this particular farm, but I looked at it and went, wow,  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:09):**  is this the future of wildlife conservation  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:12):**  in parts of the world that get developed for agriculture  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:15):**  where we could actually figure out ways  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:17):**  to have predators moving our livestock around  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:22):**  and realize that, yeah, the predators are gonna take  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:25):**  a few of them, but maybe that's a way  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:29):**  to keep biodiversity going at a large scale.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:31):**  It was just one of these things that at some point  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:33):**  could make a really neat story,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:35):**  because I had yet to be on a farm  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:38):**  where you had to worry about yourself being hunted.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:41):**  That would remind you who's on top of the food pyramid  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:44):**  really, truly, honestly, in a hurry, wouldn't it?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, without technology, we would not be sitting on top.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:50):**  Thanks. Going back to your comments  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:54):**  around glyphosate, it's been our experience  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:59):**  that if we want soils to really regenerate rapidly,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:04):**  every time we've experienced these 1.5% organic matter  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:07):**  per year surges, obviously we have to have  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:10):**  the right geology base and crop mix  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:12):**  and crop rotation, et cetera.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:14):**  And there's a lot of pieces that have to align  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:15):**  for that to happen.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:16):**  But one of the pieces that needs to be in place  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:18):**  for that to happen is that we need to remediate glyphosate  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:21):**  in this oil profile.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:23):**  And I think while the story and the awareness  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:27):**  has certainly spread within the agriculture community  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:30):**  of the implications of the impact that glyphosate can have,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:34):**  it's still not something that is as well understood  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:37):**  as it could be.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:38):**  What comments do you have to share?  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:40):**  What are the implications of glyphosate  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:41):**  that you discovered that really surprised you  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:44):**  or that were unexpected?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:46):**  In sort of looking into it,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:47):**  you sort of have to go back,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:49):**  you have to sort of go to the primary literature  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:52):**  because there's so much stuff sort of on the web  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:55):**  and in the activist world, both pro and anti-GMO  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:59):**  that deals with glyphosate that you sort of need to go  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:02):**  to the primary literature and the history of it.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:05):**  And to me, it was really quite telling  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:07):**  when I realized that there were two things  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:09):**  that glyphosate was actually patented for.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:11):**  And its original patent was as a mineral chelator,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:14):**  something that would bind up mineral elements.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:16):**  It was patented to be, I think it was a pipe cleaner,  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:19):**  a scale cleaner, something to clean mineral crud  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:22):**  out of the inside of pipes.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:25):**  And the other patent was much more recently,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:27):**  I think it was, I forget if it was in the 80s or 90s,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:29):**  but as an antibiotic.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:30):**  And a lot of the arguments about why glyphosate  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:33):**  is not dangerous to people is the tests that were done on it  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:39):**  in terms of the effect of glyphosate on mammalian tissues  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:43):**  didn't show a whole lot of toxicity.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:45):**  But the studies that have been coming out in Europe  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:48):**  for the last five years or so on the effects of glyphosate  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:53):**  on the gut microbiota of cows, chickens, pigs,  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:57):**  and I think goats, if I'm remembering all this correctly,  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:01):**  are actually pretty amazing that there's large impacts  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:04):**  on the gut microbiota at fairly small doses,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:07):**  which is because it's an antibiotic.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:10):**  And the potential for there to be high sort of secondary  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:15):**  disruption, if you will, in terms of both human health  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:17):**  and livestock health from glyphosate exposure,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:20):**  I think is much larger than is generally recognized  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:23):**  by regulatory agencies or the general public,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:26):**  because it's been thought of as something  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:29):**  that has low direct toxicity, but the vector,  
**[0:37:32-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:32):**  the pathway of impact may actually be indirect  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:35):**  through disrupting one's gut microbiome,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:37):**  which we've all heard a lot about in the last few years.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:41):**  But one of the difficult things about then connecting  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:44):**  direct impacts are that everybody's gut microbiome  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:49):**  is different, and so if glyphosate's disrupting that  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:52):**  in people, you might have the effects be manifest  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:56):**  in very different ways, and epidemiology and scientists  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:59):**  are not very good at trying to connect those kinds of dots  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:04):**  through this sort of a wild west middleman  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:06):**  of the gut microbiome where we don't even know  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:08):**  who the players are yet, let alone what they do  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:11):**  with each other, and the soil is not dissimilar.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:16):**  The root microbiome of plants is incredibly complex.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:20):**  You take a random sample of soil and census  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:23):**  the bacterial community and the fungal community in it,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:25):**  and half of them come up unknown.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:28):**  And a lot of the functions that they serve  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:30):**  to promote the health of the plants that they are  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:33):**  partnered with, or they live around in the root zone,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:36):**  come through community interactions.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:39):**  And imagine what we would know about sort of the ecology  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:44):**  of Australia if all we knew was about koala bears.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:51):**  Kangaroos.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, exactly, we knew one species.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:55):**  You don't understand the interactions,  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:57):**  or if they all look the same.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:58):**  And a big problem with understanding microbial ecology  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:01):**  of course is that to our senses, the things we're  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:05):**  naturally equipped to look for patterns in,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:08):**  the visual world in particular, they all look the same.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:11):**  They're little single-celled blobs.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:12):**  We have to rely on their chemical interactions  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:16):**  to understand how they interact ecologically.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:19):**  And we're kind of at the point today in understanding  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:21):**  soil ecology that the macroscopic ecologists were back  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:26):**  in the mid-19th century and starting to understand  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:28):**  food webs and interactions and predator-prey relationships.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:32):**  We're back at that kind of square one, I think,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:34):**  in terms of soil.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:36):**  So what is it that glyphosate's doing to the soil?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:39):**  The studies that I've looked at suggest that it's not  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:43):**  so much changing the total amount of life in the soil,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:46):**  but it's changing the community composition of that life.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:48):**  So if you just look at say, bacterial abundance,  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:51):**  you may have the same amount of bacteria in a non-sprayed  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:55):**  and a sprayed field, but the players will be different.

**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:05):**  but there's a lot of impacts that can be looked at  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:09):**  through the lens of disruption of soil microbiota  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:13):**  and gut microbiota that really deserve an awful lot  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:17):**  more attention and scrutiny in terms of looking

**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:34):**  from the GMO crop, but from the glyphosate that was used  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:38):**  in conjunction with the GMO crop.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:40):**  Yeah, I completely agree with that.

**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:44):**  One of them is there's this entire body of research

**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:52):**  We've become clear from a purely experiential,  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:56):**  practical perspective, as well as being supported

**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:02):**  Like glyphosate directly leads to producing  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:05):**  a disease enhancing soil, which is going to induce

**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:13):**  What a brilliant business model.

**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:18):**  Yeah, one of the big surprises for me in researching  
**[0:41:21-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:21):**  the hidden half of nature was looking back at how  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:24):**  deeply rooted, if you'll pardon the pun,  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:26):**  in botanical science, that recognition of disease  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:30):**  suppressive soils actually is.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:32):**  It goes back to what, 1911 or something with Hiltner,  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:36):**  looking at those kind of experiments that if you grow  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:40):**  a plant in a sterile soil versus a plant

**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:46):**  succumbs to pests and pathogens.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:47):**  The ones in the soil that have a lot of life don't.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:50):**  And that's, it's really counterintuitive  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:53):**  if we think about bacteria and fungi as just germs,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:58):**  as things that are bad to health.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:00):**  It only makes sense if we think about them as communities  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:03):**  that are actually engaged in interactions  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:05):**  with higher organisms in ways that support their health.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:08):**  And that sort of realization, that lens, if you will,  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:12):**  is an incredibly important one to get across,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:14):**  not just to agriculture, but also in medicine.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:18):**  I think an additional implication of the conversation  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:21):**  we've been having around glyphosate is we need to ask  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:25):**  the question about what really stands behind food allergies.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:31):**  I mean, when you think about those two words in conjunction,  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:33):**  a food allergy, why on earth would we be allergic to food?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:37):**  It makes no sense.

**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:42):**  being milk, eggs, wheat, those are all animal products  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:49):**  or in the case of wheat, a plant product,  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:51):**  which are often usually associated with elevated levels  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:55):**  of glyphosate.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, and I've been researching this new book  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:59):**  on soil health, human health connections.

**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:03):**  and we've talked to some doctors about,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:05):**  are people who have examples of patients who had, say,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:10):**  real wheat intolerance problems,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:11):**  but then they shifted to just eating  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:14):**  organically grown ancient varieties of wheat.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:17):**  And their so-called gluten intolerance went away.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:20):**  Now, I'm not arguing that gluten intolerance  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:22):**  is not a real thing, but I do wonder whether or not  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:27):**  some of the symptoms that some people exhibit  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:30):**  that are being attributed to that are actually due

**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:34):**  whether it's the burned out glyphosate.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:37):**  I'm not even suggesting that it's the presence of glyphosate  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:40):**  within the food that is being consumed, although it can be,

**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:46):**  of glyphosate shifting the gut microbiome

**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:40):**  I just read Gabe Brown's new book, Dirt to Soil.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:43):**  It's a really nice description of his experience.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:47):**  It's sort of the personal experience of a farmer  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:49):**  going through his evolution into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:53):**  It's not a technical book, but it's fairly short.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:56):**  It's well-written, it's inspiring.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:58):**  I definitely recommend that one.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:00):**  Anyone who's interested in trying to look at  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:03):**  how do you do no-till in organic systems,  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:07):**  I think Jeff Moyer's organic no-till book  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:10):**  is actually really instructive and interesting.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:12):**  It's more of a how-to way to go about things.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:16):**  And for the really big picture of sort of connecting  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:21):**  regenerative farming to eating in the world and cities,  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:24):**  I really like Dan Barber's The Third Plate.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:26):**  It's a good read, he's a great writer,  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:28):**  and he connects stuff to food.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:30):**  And I think that one of the real connections  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:33):**  that needs to be developed in the regenerative space  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:35):**  is this connection between how we treat the land,  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:39):**  how that essentially spirals up  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:42):**  into the health of people as well.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:44):**  And it's through both the positive benefits  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:47):**  of growing more nutrient-dense food,  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:49):**  which is something that we're looking into,  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:51):**  and there's some studies started on,  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:53):**  but it's also through reducing the use of things  
**[0:45:56-0:45:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:56):**  like glyphosate and other pesticides,  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:59):**  and getting those out of our food as much as possible.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:03):**  In a couple of moments, David, you've mentioned  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:06):**  the implications of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:09):**  being able to produce more nutrient-dense food.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:11):**  I believe that that is something that can and does happen,  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:14):**  but I'd love to hear your perspective.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:16):**  What are you discovering in the research that you're doing?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:18):**  Well, the first thing that we are discovering  
**[0:46:20-0:46:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:20):**  is that there's been too few studies  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:22):**  that have been looking to document that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:23):**  Most studies look at organic versus conventional,  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:26):**  and I've been on organic farms that have destroyed  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:29):**  their soil and conventional farms  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:30):**  that are pretty regenerative.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:32):**  So I think that a lot of the meta studies  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:34):**  that are out there that are just pitched around  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:36):**  as organic, better than conventional  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:37):**  are kind of missing the real question.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:40):**  And there's an example that hopefully will grow  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:43):**  into a study from Northern Oregon  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:45):**  that made a real impression on me last year,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:48):**  where there was a farmer down there who,  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:50):**  I went down and talked at a conservation district  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:52):**  presentation, and there was a farmer who had done  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:55):**  a two-year running experiment with two fields  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:00):**  with the same cultivar of wheat planted in them,  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:02):**  both of which were no-till, and one of which  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:05):**  he used glyphosate fallow as a rotation,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:08):**  and the other in which he used, you know,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:10):**  wheat in a complex mixture of cover crops  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:12):**  in between his wheat crops.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:13):**  So he wanted to test whether or not he could use  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:18):**  cover crops instead of glyphosate,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:19):**  and what it would do for his yield.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:21):**  But he also was then asking the question,  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:23):**  he was asking me afterwards whether or not  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:26):**  I thought there'd be any difference in the mineral content  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:29):**  of the wheat grown in those two fields.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:31):**  And I was like, well, let's test it, I don't know.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:34):**  So we got samples from that harvest  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:36):**  from both of those fields, ran them through  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:39):**  mass spec and looked at the mineral micronutrient  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:42):**  differences, and the field that had just two years  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:45):**  of cover crops instead of glyphosate had anywhere  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:48):**  from 20 to 40, 50% higher mineral micronutrient levels  
**[0:47:52-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:52):**  for the kind of things you might want,  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:54):**  like zinc, for example.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:56):**  And, you know, I sort of came back and went, wow,  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:00):**  those are big jumps in numbers over two years.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:02):**  These are fields like right next to each other,  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:04):**  they have the same weather, in the same parent material,  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:07):**  same farmer, the only difference was how he treated  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:10):**  the land for two years.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:12):**  And the only way that I can make sense out of that  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:16):**  is that by going through the diverse mixture  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:19):**  of cover crops, he was rebuilding the mycorrhizal fungi  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:24):**  and bacterial relationships in the soil  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:26):**  that allowed his crop to actually extract more zinc  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:29):**  from the mineral particles in the soil.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:31):**  Because you couldn't change the zinc concentration  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:34):**  on the soil itself in two years unless you added  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:36):**  a bunch of zinc, which he didn't do.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:38):**  But you could get more out of the soil  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:40):**  if you brought the biology back,  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:42):**  which you can do in a season or two.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:44):**  So I've started to become very interested  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:47):**  in just how fast we could boost the mineral micronutrient  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:52):**  and phytochemical content of foods  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:55):**  using regenerative practices.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:57):**  But frankly, we need more data, we need more comparisons.

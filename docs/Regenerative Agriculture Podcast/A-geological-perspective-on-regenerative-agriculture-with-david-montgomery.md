**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:06):**  that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:30):**  and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together  in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission  to have these regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which  all other growing systems are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal,  I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:01:11):**  If you have any questions, suggestions,  comments, or topics of ideas  that you would like for me to discuss,

**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:02:27):**  on behalf of agricultural producers.  And our focus really is to look at how soil changes  relative to management.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:02:35):**  How can we improve our soils  not only for production efficiency,  but how it influences all ecosystem services  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:02:42):**  in terms of environmental quality,  habitat for pollinators, water quality,  this intersection between agriculture and the environment.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:02:50):**  If you want to work with us on on-farm research,  contact us at www.ars.usda.gov.  I'm excited to be here with David Montgomery,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:05):**  who's published several books that have led him  to the regenerative agriculture movement.  And David doesn't come from an agronomy background,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:14):**  but instead has been approaching this  from a geology and a geomorphology perspective.  David, you've written a couple of really great books.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:22):**  You've written Dirt and the Hidden Half of Nature,  Growing a Revolution, your most recent book,  which I think has been very widely acclaimed  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:29):**  in the regenerative agriculture space.  What brought you to this pathway?  How did you get started researching agriculture?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:37):**  Oh, thanks, John.  I actually came to it because I'm the kind of geologist  that studies erosion.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:44):**  I study what shapes the surface of the earth.  And so when you think about what shapes hillsides  or mountains, you're really talking about erosion.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:03:53):**  So I've studied erosion for decades,  but mostly from a very long-term perspective,  how it shapes the surface of the world  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:00):**  that we know and walk around on.  And I came to thinking about agriculture really  by that first book,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:06):**  the Dirt, the Erosion, and the Civilizations book,  the first book I wrote that dealt with soils.  It was an attempt to try and bridge my interest  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:14):**  in landscape evolution and how erosion works,  and my training and background in that,  with thinking about the way that soil erosion  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:21):**  had affected ancient civilizations.  I thought it would be a great way to visit places  around the world that visit ancient societies  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:29):**  and bring my training to bear on what I thought  would be an intellectually interesting story.  And it turned out that as I was writing that book,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:36):**  I ended up writing a book about the history of farming,  because that's really where the connection  between soil erosion, soil degradation,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:45):**  over the long-term connects back to human societies.  The story really was one of how farming practices  had affected the fertility of the land  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:04:53):**  over millennia and generations,  and how that had affected human societies.  So I started from this big picture, long-term perspective,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:02):**  looking at how agriculture has influenced people  in sort of a slightly different way  than we normally think about.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:08):**  And that started me on the road  to where I've eventually ended up today,  is thinking about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:14):**  as a way to solve the problems that I was talking about  and identified in the dirt book.  So I came at regenerative agriculture  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:21):**  kind of from a different angle  than I think most people come to it from,  but it's been a very illuminating journey for me.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:28):**  And I hope for readers along the way  that have sort of shared in my growth and education  as I've looked into this.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:37):**  David, you're speaking about erosion  as being a primary problem.  And I heard a data point a couple of years ago  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:45):**  that really caught my attention  that the state of Iowa loses two pounds of topsoil  for every pound of corn produced.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:05:53):**  You know, how is that gonna last, right?  Yeah, and we've already degraded something like a third  of the world's agricultural land to the point  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:04):**  where it's not really being used commercially  for agriculture.  And we're on the path to do another 30% or so  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:11):**  this century according to the UN's 2015  Global State of the Soil Report.  For basically losing the soil  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:19):**  through the ways that we grow our food,  then we're effectively mining the soil  to feed ourselves today.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:25):**  And I mean, one of the most amazing things about the soil  as a physical entity on earth  is that it's naturally renewable.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:32):**  It's a very renewable resource if we steward it  and shepherd it and take care of it.  But it's also mineable if we use it faster  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:40):**  than we're regenerating it.  We can quite literally run out of it.  And societies in different parts of the world  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:47):**  have done that in the past.  And we're, as your story from Iowa illustrates,  we're on track to do that again  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:06:53):**  with a roast of farming practices today.  Yet we've made great strides as well.  And I've turned from something of a pessimist  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:00):**  into something of an unrepentant optimist on this issue.  I think we can actually solve this problem.  That's what the whole revolution book was about.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:08):**  But yeah, those statistics like you were just citing  are those kinds of things that slap you in the face  and go, wow, something's got to change here.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:16):**  When you think about shifting from a pessimist to an optimist  one of the questions that comes to my mind is  how big is the problem really?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:22):**  Isn't the problem inflated?  Well, there's actually sort of two dimensions  to the problem.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:28):**  And some people will have the problem  in the public sphere has been inflated to some degree.  There's a series of articles that made the rounds  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:36):**  I think a few years ago where someone was saying,  someone at the UN said,  we're gonna totally run out of soil in 60 years.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:43):**  That's not gonna happen.  But we are on track to degrade enough of it  that it will impact our ability to feed people.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:52):**  That part's true.  But there's really two dimensions  to the soil degradation problem.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:07:56):**  One is the actual erosion and loss of the soil.  And that's a bigger problem in some parts of the world  than others.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:02):**  But the other part is the degradation  of the fertility of the soil,  the loss of soil organic matter.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:07):**  And whether you look across the US as a whole or globally,  the estimates are we've degraded something like half  of the soil organic matter from our agricultural fields.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:18):**  And if you understand soil organic matter  as the sort of the lifeblood of the life in the soil,  if you will, the currency that keeps  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:25):**  that whole underground biological economy going,  that's real cause for concern.  Because once you degrade the soil  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:33):**  through loss of organic matter enough,  you basically become hooked on relying on agrochemicals  to maintain agricultural production.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:43):**  And if that production is tied very much to fossil fuels,  all these problems compound in terms  of the challenges we face this century.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:08:52):**  So in some areas, the soil loss problem  has been somewhat inflated.  But it's a very serious problem  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:01):**  and a really key problem to why it's been so difficult  to solve is that it happens relatively slowly.  It's a problem that plays out over decades and centuries.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:11):**  And sometimes, ironically, it's the slower things  that are kind of harder for us to deal with and stop  because they don't always rise to the crisis de jour.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:22):**  When you describe this cope with a problem, David,  it is, I mean, thinking about losing half  of our soil's productive capacity  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:28):**  over the last several centuries,  it's quite intriguing to consider  that you've become an optimist  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:35):**  and thinking that we can correct it.  What's the pathway to correcting the problem?  Boy, yeah, if you'd asked me 10 years ago  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:44):**  when I was finishing the dirt book,  if I'd become an unrepentant optimist on this issue,  I might not have believed it.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:50):**  I struggled really hard with how to write  the last chapter of that book.  And the version that ended up in the book  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:09:56):**  was my third attempt because the first two  were too depressing for me to want  actually put out there in the world.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:02):**  And what I came down with in the dirt book  is I recommended essentially trying to figure out  how to get no-till farming and organic farming  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:10):**  to work together, which was a real challenge  in terms of weed control and organic systems  and how to use no-till systems without the herbicides  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:19):**  that 10 years ago were so essential  to most people's use of that.  And what really turned me into an optimist  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:28):**  was actually going out over the next five years or so  after that book came out and speaking at conferences  where farmers were speaking.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:35):**  And I'd be asked to give a talk  on the history of soil erosion  and the backwards-looking view of a geologist.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:41):**  But I would also then attend the conference  and I had started seeing talks  from people like Gabe Brown and Duane Beck,  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:47):**  people who were farmers who had restored fertility  to very degraded land.  And they did it through intensive agriculture,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:10:55):**  through practices that were growing a lot of food  but that were rebuilding the health  and fertility of their soil.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:02):**  And I started thinking, oh,  I need to go visit some of these guys.  I need to look at their farms, dig holes in their farms,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:08):**  dig holes in their neighbors' farms,  think about what's happening to the soil  and find out what are the real sort of tricks  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:13):**  and secrets behind what they're doing.  And part of what catalyzed me into going off  and taking six months to travel around the world  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:21):**  and interview farmers like that was at the same time  as I was finishing the dirt book,  my wife who's a gardener, she's a biologist  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:29):**  and a major league gardener.  We'd bought a house in North Seattle  and she took on a project to restore the soil in our yard.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:37):**  And she did it far faster than I could have guessed  that it would have happened.  Within four or five years of her intensive composting  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:46):**  and mulching and returning organic matter  to the soil in our yard,  we're starting to see the soil change color,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:51):**  the soil came back to life,  animals started coming back to our yard  and what turned out to be pretty much the same order  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:11:59):**  in which life evolved on earth from microbes to arachnids  to worms to pollinators and different types of plants  all the way up to an eagle that ate the baby crow  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:11):**  that was eating the worms  that were eating the organic matter that Anne added  to the yard.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:16):**  And finally the drunk that came  and added the human cherry on top.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:23):**  But you're seeing our soil in our yard come back to life  so fast, in less than a decade,  going from less than 1% organic matter  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:31):**  up to about 8 to 10% across the yard.  And just the transformative effect  that it had on the above ground biology  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:38):**  really started me thinking and Anne thinking about,  wow, could you do this at scale on real farms?  And that's where having seen these talks  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:46):**  by the Gabe Browns of the world  and the Dwayne Becks of the world  sort of set me off on a path to ask,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:12:51):**  well, could you do on farms  with commercially viable agriculture  what Anne had done in our yard with a very souped up hobby  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:01):**  in terms of gardening in her case.  And I started learning from regenerative farmers  who had decades of experience  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:09):**  in tinkering around with their methods  and how they would actually rebuild  the fertility of their soil.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:14):**  And I'm kind of a synthesizer.  I like to look for patterns and draw the generalities out.  And so I traveled around talking to farmers like that  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:24):**  and then stood back and asked the question of,  what did all these people have in common?  What was the framework?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:30):**  And it lines up really well with what we think of today  as regenerative agriculture.  David, that is perfect.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:36):**  That's exactly the place that I was hoping to go next.  What we've observed in our work  at Advancing Eco-Agriculture is exceptional instances  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:45):**  where soils, even under commercial cropping  production systems are gaining as much  as a half a percentage point of organic matter per year.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:52):**  And there is this constant question that keeps coming up is,  is that repeatable?  Can we do that consistently?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:13:58):**  Can we do it on a large scale?  So within that context, what are the tools and practices  that growers were using to deliver  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:07):**  those results consistently?  Well, you know, there was a consistent set of principles  that tracked across all the really successful ones  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:16):**  I visited and they may not be the only principles out there  that would work, but they worked in these cases.  But the actual practices that the people used  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:24):**  in different regions were completely different.  So those principles were things like, you know,  don't disturb the ground surface.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:30):**  So it was minimal disturbance, no till practices,  or a minimum of surficial disturbance  in terms of light disking or stuff.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:39):**  But everyone that I visited who was very successful  had gone the no disturbance route  in one sort of variety of no till or another.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:45):**  They all kept the ground surface covered.  They all planted cover crops.  So there was a living plant in the soil at all times.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:14:52):**  It was sort of the don't farm naked kind of philosophy.  And the third one was that they all had rotations  or diversity in their cover crops  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:02):**  that were more than about four crops.  So it was a complex rotation, much more complex  than say, you know, corn, corn, corn, or corn and soybeans.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:11):**  I think that's the antithesis of complexity.  Yes, exactly.  I like to say that corn and soybeans is not a rotation.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:20):**  So it's, you know, with those things  in terms of minimal disturbance,  keeping cover crops and diversity,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:25):**  that was the foundation that was really across the board.  Some of the people I visited  were reintroducing animal agriculture  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:32):**  and reintegrating it with their cropping systems.  And I came to view that as not an essential element  of soil restoration, but something that has the potential  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:41):**  to be a tremendous accelerator in the sense that,  say you bring in cattle to graze off a cover crop,  then by using the cattle to terminate the cover crop,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:52):**  you're accelerating the breakdown of the cover crop  back into soluble forms of nutrients  that the plant can take back up  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:15:59):**  because what comes out in the manure  is more processed and broken down and full of microbes  than just leaving the stalks on the surface of the ground.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:09):**  So, you know, and at the highest level,  what really seemed to be the root of regenerative farming,  that, you know, farming practices that work  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:16):**  to regenerate the fertility of the soil  were a system that would cultivate  the beneficial life in the soil.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:24):**  And if you think about sort of the dominant way  that we've looked at agriculture  in the conventional world for the last century,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:33):**  it's been about how do we sort of manage  or kill the things we don't want on the fields  rather than how do we cultivate the kind of conditions  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:41):**  for life in the soil that will help our crops thrive  using their own natural defense systems  and their partners, their allies, if you will,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:16:51):**  in the root zone, the bacteria and the fungi  that work in conjunction with plants  and the kind of mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:00):**  that Ann and I wrote about in The Hidden Half of Nature.  And there's lots of different ways  to try and actually promote and cultivate the beneficial life  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:08):**  in the soil.  But if you look at the kind of principles  of ditch the plow, cover up and grow diversity  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:16):**  that are behind those three big  conservation agriculture principles,  that's about 180 degree philosophical shift  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:23):**  from what we've been teaching people in ag schools  for the last 80 years as the backbone  of conventional farming where it was heavy tillage  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:32):**  with lots of agrochemicals  and specializing in one or two crops.  So the real key seemed to be, first of all,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:41):**  thinking about the place of the soil really differently  in our philosophy of farming  and then layering on the practices  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:49):**  that cultivate the beneficial life in the soil.  David, in the conversations that you've had with farmers  and the conversations that I've had with growers  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:17:58):**  and agronomists, I find the perspective  that you expressed on livestock to be a common theme.  Generally, the really successful agronomists and growers  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:09):**  who are regenerating soil health  are incorporating livestock into the ecosystem  in some manner, if at all possible.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:17):**  It's not always, but if possible,  they're incorporating them.  And I find that this is a commonly held perspective  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:23):**  and it is completely contrary  to the celebrity perspective of veganism being,  vegan diets and no meat diets  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:33):**  being the solution to climate change.  Yeah, no, I've been working on a textbook on sustainability  for my publisher for the last five years.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:43):**  So we're almost done,  but we've been trying to integrate the sort of social science  and biological and physical science  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:51):**  at an introductory level for all those things.  And one of the most challenging bits of that  was taking the sort of the draft parts  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:18:58):**  on agriculture that dealt with livestock  and its place in sustainability for that very reason,  because the sort of the go-to,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:07):**  as you put it, you put the celebrity perspective of,  you know, we must go vegetarian to save the world.  You know, it actually really depends,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:16):**  I think a lot on how livestock is raised  as to what their net environmental impact actually is.  And this is where my own thinking has evolved quite a lot  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:25):**  over the last 10 years,  because when I was finishing the dirt book,  there's lots of examples historically where overgrazing  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:32):**  didn't destroy the soil,  but it kept the soil from rebuilding.  And there's places where it caused gullies,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:38):**  you know, the Southwest of California,  good places where it's been well demonstrated  that if you graze livestock for too long  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:46):**  in the same place in the valley bottoms in a landscape  where that's where the only water is,  it causes a royals, gullies to develop.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:19:53):**  So I came to the problem of animals  and agriculture from that perspective.  Oh, cows are bad, they cause erosion.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:00):**  But seeing people who had actually used their livestock  in different ways, and as actually as a tool  of soil rebuilding, as in effect  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:08):**  as self-propelled methane digesters  that can convert cover crops into manure,  and thereby accelerate the cycling of nutrients in the soil,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:18):**  and seeing people have had success turning, you know,  one or 2% organic matter soils into much richer,  you know, 5%, 6%, 8% organic matter soils  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:27):**  over the course of, you know, a decade or so,  convinced me that there's a different way  to look at livestock in the whole agricultural equation.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:37):**  And so I think we can point, we can certainly point  to the adverse environmental impacts  of, you know, confined animal feeding operations,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:45):**  CAFOs, where we feed livestock corn grown  with conventional practices, mining the soil,  and using a lot of fossil fuels to then, you know,  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:20:56):**  take that 10 to one hit on the food chain,  where you're spending 10 times the energy  to get something for that next trophic level,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:05):**  it's not a very efficient way overall  to generate calories for people.  And so in that sense, you know,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:11):**  the celebrity perspective has some legs on it.  The way we tend to grow livestock  is not a great environmentally.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:19):**  But if you turn around and look at, oh,  well, there's all these great areas of the world  that are grasslands and seminary grassland environments,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:27):**  where moisture is a big challenge  in terms of growing a lot of crops,  and conventional practices are erosive.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:36):**  And you look at, well, how what's the best way  to use those landscapes to feed people?  And, you know, cows do this amazing thing  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:43):**  of turning grass, something we can't eat,  and which grows over, you know,  what, a quarter of the continents or something,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:51):**  into product, cattle will turn that into,  you know, meat and dairy that we actually can eat.  And if you integrate them back with cropping,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:21:58):**  they can actually help sustain the fertility of the land.  So my perspective on the whole livestock issue these days  has changed radically.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:05):**  And I'm convinced that livestock can be a component  of soil restoration and regeneration,  but it's all about how we manage the livestock.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:14):**  The problem's not the livestock,  the problem is what we do with the livestock.  Very well spoken.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:19):**  Completely agree, and I couldn't,  I can't even expand on that.  David, you've approached soil health  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:29):**  from a geology perspective and the historical perspective  of many geologists that it takes a really long time  to build soils.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:38):**  So as a reformed geologist,  and now that you've had conversations  with many different farmers,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:44):**  what are the realistic expectations?  How rapidly can we rebuild soil health?  And what should we be striving for?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:22:52):**  You know, you've just hit on half of the equation  that turned me into an optimist on this issue,  because if you go back to sort of a basic geology textbook,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:00):**  say, you'll find, or if you even actually just measure  the rate at which nature builds soils,  you end up getting rates of it takes centuries to millennia  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:09):**  to build an inch of fertile soil.  And, you know, credible estimates for how fast nature  builds soil on average on the planet, you know,  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:16):**  500 to 1,000 years per inch is probably a decent average.  But, you know, it's highly variable,  there's lots of different environments in the world.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:23):**  But that rate presumes you're taking a rock  and turning it into soil.  And, you know, I've got rocks all over my garden,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:33):**  that are all over my wife's garden  that I've brought home from all over the world.  And they don't break down very fast,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:39):**  even here in the Northwest where it rains all the time.  Rocks are pretty stable.  It takes centuries to millennia to break a rock down  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:46):**  and turn it into soil.  But one of the things that Ann taught me  with the lesson of the garden,  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:23:53):**  was that if you already have the mineral matter,  and in our yard we had ground up bits  of British Columbia granite that a glacier delivered  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:02):**  down to Seattle 15,000 years ago.  So we had the mineral part of soil.  It was all broken up, or you can dig it up.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:10):**  What we didn't have was the organic matter.  We didn't have the biology.  We didn't have the life.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:15):**  And it turns out that you can restore,  the key to restoring soil fertility rapidly,  isn't thinking about making it from scratch.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:23):**  It's thinking about starting with the geological part of it  and adding the biology.  Because you can add the biology,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:30):**  you can kickstart the biology really fast.  If you've got to wait to break down  a piece of granite into sand,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:36):**  yeah, you're gonna be waiting a long time.  But if you're basically trying to figure out  how do you get organic matter  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:43):**  into the broken up mineral particles of a soil  where the rocks have already been crushed up,  you can actually do it real fast.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:24:51):**  And that's where the rates of a quarter to a third  to even a half a percent organic matter increase per year  are actually feasible if you've got the mineral part  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:04):**  and you focus on how to actually kickstart that biology  and bring life literally back to the soil.  That's the subtitle of Growing Revolution,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:13):**  bringing our soils back to life.  It is meant to be taken literally,  putting life back in the soil  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:19):**  is the key to rebuilding soil quite rapidly.  And by quite rapidly, I'm a geologist,  so I think 10, 20 years is actually screamingly fast.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:29):**  That could be, could test the patience  of an individual farmer.  But there's enough people now who have experience  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:38):**  in rebuilding the fertility of soils  that I think there's a good experiential database  to draw on for how to accelerate that  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:47):**  in different parts of the world.  So if we could actually make major headway  on restoring organic matter in soils  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:25:53):**  over the course of a decade,  whether it's at 0.2% or 0.3% increase a year,  you play that out over a decade  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:01):**  and you're starting to get into the two, three plus percent  range, even at what could be a very feasible and low rate  of improvement.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:10):**  And at the high end,  with the examples you were talking about earlier,  about a half a percent or so a year,  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:15):**  if I recall what you're saying,  that's sort of at the high end of the examples  I saw as well, I think it's feasible.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:21):**  And the reason I think it's feasible  is because I've seen people that have done it.  And I'm an empiricist, if it's been done, it can be done.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah, it has been done.  And it's been done on a substantial scale,  on a scale of thousands of acres,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:33):**  which I think answers about whether it's scalable.  Yeah, oh yeah.  And that's one of the big revelations to me  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:38):**  in growing a revolution was that it's,  these principles are totally scalable.  The practices you would use to scale them may vary,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:45):**  depending on where you are in the world  and what kind of technology people have available.  But they scale.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:50):**  It's not just something for backyard gardens.  There's the biggest farms I was looking at  were like 20,000 acres,  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:26:56):**  which to me is a large, you know,  that's probably about the size of the city of Seattle.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:04):**  David, you've approached agriculture  from a very different perspective,  the perspective that as growers and agronomists,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:11):**  we don't often get to think about a great deal.  When you think about modern agriculture,  agriculture as it has developed today,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:21):**  what do you believe to be true about modern agriculture  that is perhaps different from the mainstream view?  Oh boy, you know, one of the biggest things that I run,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:35):**  I just keep running into and dealing with people  in the mainstream media are the idea  that we have a choice between sort of  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:42):**  environmentally friendly agriculture and feeding the world.  That if we go organic, say,  that we will all starve to death.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:51):**  And I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions  that's out there.  And I know that people in the regenerative agriculture space  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:27:58):**  probably aren't in that zone of misconception,  but it's a pretty big pool of misconception out there.  And so I actually think that the key  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:07):**  to sustaining long-term farming is through restoring  and accelerating the natural cycles of growth and decay  and recycling the way that soils have worked  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:20):**  for 450 million years.  And that we need to work with those systems  rather than try and manipulate and alter those systems.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:29):**  I think that in the 20th century,  with the rise of what we now consider  conventional agriculture, but which is actually brand new,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:37):**  if you look at it in the big sweep of things.  It should be considered alternative agriculture.  Yeah, it should be considered, you know,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:44):**  that experiment we did in the 20th century.  And we should be asking how well did it work?  And at one level it worked really well to increase crop  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:28:53):**  yields, but it also degraded a lot of our land  and our future ability to grow crops.  And there's questions about what it did to the quality  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:01):**  of the food that we eat as well,  and the nutrient density of foods.  So David, you've spoken with growers  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:09):**  from all over the world.  You've written three different books,  which I highly encourage everyone to read,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:15):**  particularly the last, Growing a Revolution.  Once I started reading it, didn't stop until I was finished.  So it's a very enlightening read.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:22):**  Oh, thank you.  With this entire pathway that you've been on,  what has been something that has surprised you the most?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:32):**  What was the most unexpected?  Well, you know, really the single most unexpected thing  was how fast Anne restored the soil in our yard.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:42):**  That was a total eye-opener to me,  because I was coming at it from this,  it takes centuries to millennia to grow an inch of soil  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:50):**  kind of perspective.  And right under my nose in the backyard,  she demonstrated that she could basically turn that around.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:29:57):**  And she grew several inches of soil in less than five years.  And I was just like, you know,  there's nothing in the journals that says you can do this.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:05):**  This is like way too fast.  And that was one of those sort of light bulb moments.  I remember the first time she and I sort of realized that,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:14):**  wow, our soil is changing really fast,  was when she had a plant that she wanted to transplant  from one place to another.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:21):**  She'd like planted it in what she declared a few years later  to be the wrong spot.  Plant wasn't happy, needed to move.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:25):**  So we dug a hole to move it out.  And it was, I think it was about four years  after she started her organic matter crusade  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:33):**  to restore the soil in the yard.  And we noticed that, wow,  we've got a couple inches of soil here  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:37):**  that wasn't there when we started the yard.  And that was just total eye-opener moment.  The other kind of eye-opener moments were,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:48):**  I think a big one for me was going to the World Congress  on Conservation Agriculture in 2014,  because I saw a series of farmers speak there  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:30:58):**  who really sparked the idea in my mind to,  I should go visit some of these people  and see their farms and see what I was thinking of,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:07):**  you know, have they done on their farm  what Ann did in our yard?  And making that connection was sort of a leap up for me  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:14):**  in terms of, oh, how do you scale these things?  Could you actually do what Ann did,  but do it on commercial farms at scale  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:23):**  in both the developed and developing world?  So those two sort of moments were things  where they set me off on the course that ended up,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:32):**  that culminated in writing Growing Revolution.  What didn't make it into the book?  There's always, every time I write a little bit,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:42):**  and I know that there's always things  that you want to put in that don't make it,  so I'm curious, what was that for you?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:49):**  There were hundreds of pages that didn't make it in.  I've got these files full of stuff  that I haven't made into one book or another,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:31:55):**  but there's a couple things that we thought about  putting into Hidden Affinature, didn't make it in there.  We thought, I thought about doing it in Growing Revolution,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:02):**  didn't make it in there, but one of them is  we have a huge file on glyphosate,  and we wrote a bit about glyphosate in both books,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:11):**  but not very much, because we were trying to wade through  the sort of the science, and it didn't get comfortable  until fairly recently with how we sort of think about that,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:21):**  and didn't want to commit in writing  before I was comfortable that I understood the science  enough to know what I was, at least to think  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:28):**  I knew what I was saying.  And so sort of wrestling with the role of glyphosate  as a disruptor of the microbiome,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:35):**  the sort of life in the soil,  and in the gut of livestock and people,  was something that didn't make it in,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:41):**  because we didn't think we could support the argument  to the extent that, that now in hindsight  I think is warranted.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:48):**  So Anne and I are working on a new book now  that that stuff may end up getting into.  And there was also a trip to South Africa  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:32:56):**  that did not make it into Growing Revolution.  It was to visit a really progressive farm in South Africa,  but when the key agronomist wasn't on site when I was there,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:06):**  and so I couldn't interview him,  and I just couldn't connect all the dots,  it would have made a great story.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:12):**  Maybe someday I'll do a magazine piece on it,  because this farmer was keeping cheetahs  in his crop circles in South Africa,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:20):**  and he had livestock that instead of using cows  the way North American regenerative farmers were,  he was using native South African species  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:31):**  of grazing ungulates to graze off his cover crops,  and then he had cheetahs that would hunt the grazers.  And so he had big barbed wire fences  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:41):**  around his crop circles saying, do not enter.  But that does sound like a fascinating story.  Was he using the cheetahs to keep the animals grouped?  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:49):**  No, he was using the cheetahs  because he was very much into cheetah conservation,  and it was as a rehabilitation area for cheetahs  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:33:57):**  that had been displaced or injured in the wild.  So it was sort of this complicated story  of this particular farm, but I looked at it and went, wow,  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:09):**  is this the future of wildlife conservation  in parts of the world that get developed for agriculture  where we could actually figure out ways  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:17):**  to have predators moving our livestock around  and realize that, yeah, the predators are gonna take  a few of them, but maybe that's a way  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:29):**  to keep biodiversity going at a large scale.  It was just one of these things that at some point  could make a really neat story,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:35):**  because I had yet to be on a farm  where you had to worry about yourself being hunted.  That would remind you who's on top of the food pyramid  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:44):**  really, truly, honestly, in a hurry, wouldn't it?  Yeah, without technology, we would not be sitting on top.  Thank you.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:34:50):**  Thanks. Going back to your comments  around glyphosate, it's been our experience  that if we want soils to really regenerate rapidly,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:04):**  every time we've experienced these 1.5% organic matter  per year surges, obviously we have to have  the right geology base and crop mix  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:12):**  and crop rotation, et cetera.  And there's a lot of pieces that have to align  for that to happen.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:16):**  But one of the pieces that needs to be in place  for that to happen is that we need to remediate glyphosate  in this oil profile.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:22):**  Yeah.  And I think while the story and the awareness  has certainly spread within the agriculture community  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:30):**  of the implications of the impact that glyphosate can have,  it's still not something that is as well understood  as it could be.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:38):**  What comments do you have to share?  What are the implications of glyphosate  that you discovered that really surprised you  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:44):**  or that were unexpected?  In sort of looking into it,  you sort of have to go back,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:49):**  you have to sort of go to the primary literature  because there's so much stuff sort of on the web  and in the activist world, both pro and anti-GMO  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:35:59):**  that deals with glyphosate that you sort of need to go  to the primary literature and the history of it.  And to me, it was really quite telling  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:07):**  when I realized that there were two things  that glyphosate was actually patented for.  And its original patent was as a mineral chelator,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:14):**  something that would bind up mineral elements.  It was patented to be, I think it was a pipe cleaner,  a scale cleaner, something to clean mineral crud  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:22):**  out of the inside of pipes.  And the other patent was much more recently,  I think it was, I forget if it was in the 80s or 90s,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:29):**  but as an antibiotic.  And a lot of the arguments about why glyphosate  is not dangerous to people is the tests that were done on it  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:39):**  in terms of the effect of glyphosate on mammalian tissues  didn't show a whole lot of toxicity.  But the studies that have been coming out in Europe  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:36:48):**  for the last five years or so on the effects of glyphosate  on the gut microbiota of cows, chickens, pigs,  and I think goats, if I'm remembering all this correctly,  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:01):**  are actually pretty amazing that there's large impacts  on the gut microbiota at fairly small doses,  which is because it's an antibiotic.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:10):**  And the potential for there to be high sort of secondary  disruption, if you will, in terms of both human health  and livestock health from glyphosate exposure,  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:20):**  I think is much larger than is generally recognized  by regulatory agencies or the general public,  because it's been thought of as something  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:29):**  that has low direct toxicity, but the vector,  the pathway of impact may actually be indirect  through disrupting one's gut microbiome,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:37):**  which we've all heard a lot about in the last few years.  But one of the difficult things about then connecting  direct impacts are that everybody's gut microbiome  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:49):**  is different, and so if glyphosate's disrupting that  in people, you might have the effects be manifest  in very different ways, and epidemiology and scientists  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:37:59):**  are not very good at trying to connect those kinds of dots  through this sort of a wild west middleman  of the gut microbiome where we don't even know  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:08):**  who the players are yet, let alone what they do  with each other, and the soil is not dissimilar.  The root microbiome of plants is incredibly complex.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:20):**  You take a random sample of soil and census  the bacterial community and the fungal community in it,  and half of them come up unknown.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:28):**  And a lot of the functions that they serve  to promote the health of the plants that they are  partnered with, or they live around in the root zone,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:36):**  come through community interactions.  And imagine what we would know about sort of the ecology  of Australia if all we knew was about koala bears.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:51):**  Kangaroos.  Yeah, exactly, we knew one species.  You don't understand the interactions,  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:38:57):**  or if they all look the same.  And a big problem with understanding microbial ecology  of course is that to our senses, the things we're  
**[0:39:05-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:05):**  naturally equipped to look for patterns in,  the visual world in particular, they all look the same.  They're little single-celled blobs.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:12):**  We have to rely on their chemical interactions  to understand how they interact ecologically.  And we're kind of at the point today in understanding  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:21):**  soil ecology that the macroscopic ecologists were back  in the mid-19th century and starting to understand  food webs and interactions and predator-prey relationships.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:32):**  We're back at that kind of square one, I think,  in terms of soil.  So what is it that glyphosate's doing to the soil?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:39):**  The studies that I've looked at suggest that it's not  so much changing the total amount of life in the soil,  but it's changing the community composition of that life.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:48):**  So if you just look at say, bacterial abundance,  you may have the same amount of bacteria in a non-sprayed  and a sprayed field, but the players will be different.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:39:58):**  And I think the fungal density is more sensitive,  if I'm recalling that right.  Now I've forgotten where you started with the question,  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:05):**  but there's a lot of impacts that can be looked at  through the lens of disruption of soil microbiota  and gut microbiota that really deserve an awful lot  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:17):**  more attention and scrutiny in terms of looking  at the effects of glyphosate.  And I suspect that when we do find that a lot of the effects  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:26):**  that are being attributed sort of generally to GMOs  in the activist world will be looked at,  but oh, these are actually effects not so much  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:34):**  from the GMO crop, but from the glyphosate that was used  in conjunction with the GMO crop.  Yeah, I completely agree with that.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:42):**  And there's two comments that I would add to that.  One of them is there's this entire body of research  around developing disease suppressive  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:50):**  versus disease enhancing soils.  Yeah.  We've become clear from a purely experiential,  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:40:56):**  practical perspective, as well as being supported  by the theories of disease suppressed soil.  Like glyphosate directly leads to producing  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:05):**  a disease enhancing soil, which is going to induce  more root pathogenicity, et cetera.  Yeah, which is gonna increase the market for pesticides.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:13):**  What a brilliant business model.  It is at that.  Yeah, one of the big surprises for me in researching  
**[0:41:21-0:41:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:21):**  the hidden half of nature was looking back at how  deeply rooted, if you'll pardon the pun,  in botanical science, that recognition of disease  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:30):**  suppressive soils actually is.  It goes back to what, 1911 or something with Hiltner,  looking at those kind of experiments that if you grow  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:40):**  a plant in a sterile soil versus a plant  in a life filled soil, the one in the sterile soil  succumbs to pests and pathogens.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:47):**  The ones in the soil that have a lot of life don't.  And that's, it's really counterintuitive  if we think about bacteria and fungi as just germs,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:41:58):**  as things that are bad to health.  It only makes sense if we think about them as communities  that are actually engaged in interactions  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:05):**  with higher organisms in ways that support their health.  And that sort of realization, that lens, if you will,  is an incredibly important one to get across,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:14):**  not just to agriculture, but also in medicine.  I think an additional implication of the conversation  we've been having around glyphosate is we need to ask  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:25):**  the question about what really stands behind food allergies.  I mean, when you think about those two words in conjunction,  a food allergy, why on earth would we be allergic to food?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:37):**  It makes no sense.  And when you think about the most common food allergies  being milk, eggs, wheat, those are all animal products  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:49):**  or in the case of wheat, a plant product,  which are often usually associated with elevated levels  of glyphosate.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, and I've been researching this new book  on soil health, human health connections.  And one of the things we've been asking people about,  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:03):**  and we've talked to some doctors about,  are people who have examples of patients who had, say,  real wheat intolerance problems,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:11):**  but then they shifted to just eating  organically grown ancient varieties of wheat.  And their so-called gluten intolerance went away.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:20):**  Now, I'm not arguing that gluten intolerance  is not a real thing, but I do wonder whether or not  some of the symptoms that some people exhibit  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:30):**  that are being attributed to that are actually due  to things like you're suggesting,  whether it's the burned out glyphosate.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:37):**  I'm not even suggesting that it's the presence of glyphosate  within the food that is being consumed, although it can be,  but is it also possible that it could be the presence  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:46):**  of glyphosate shifting the gut microbiome  such that foods that we should not be allergic to,  we now are?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:54):**  Oh, you know, I don't know.  That's an interesting idea.  That's an interesting idea.  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:43:58):**  I'm not sure.  I think that there is a higher potential  than most people recognize for sort of residual levels  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:05):**  of glyphosate, if you will,  to affect the human gut microbiome.  I can't find any studies that have actually looked at that.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:11):**  I've only been able to find them in livestock.  I don't imagine we're so different  from livestock biologically that there wouldn't be  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:18):**  the potential for some kind of an effect.  Whether or not it extends to the kind of shift  you were just suggesting, I don't know.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:24):**  That's a really interesting idea.  David, what is a book or resource?  Obviously you have your own books,  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:31):**  which I very highly recommend.  What is a resource that you would recommend  for farmers or growers to pay attention to?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:39):**  Oh boy.  I just read Gabe Brown's new book, Dirt to Soil.  It's a really nice description of his experience.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:47):**  It's sort of the personal experience of a farmer  going through his evolution into regenerative agriculture.  It's not a technical book, but it's fairly short.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:44:56):**  It's well-written, it's inspiring.  I definitely recommend that one.  Anyone who's interested in trying to look at  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:03):**  how do you do no-till in organic systems,  I think Jeff Moyer's organic no-till book  is actually really instructive and interesting.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:12):**  It's more of a how-to way to go about things.  And for the really big picture of sort of connecting  regenerative farming to eating in the world and cities,  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:24):**  I really like Dan Barber's The Third Plate.  It's a good read, he's a great writer,  and he connects stuff to food.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:30):**  And I think that one of the real connections  that needs to be developed in the regenerative space  is this connection between how we treat the land,  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:39):**  how that essentially spirals up  into the health of people as well.  And it's through both the positive benefits  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:47):**  of growing more nutrient-dense food,  which is something that we're looking into,  and there's some studies started on,  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:45:53):**  but it's also through reducing the use of things  like glyphosate and other pesticides,  and getting those out of our food as much as possible.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:03):**  In a couple of moments, David, you've mentioned  the implications of regenerative agriculture  being able to produce more nutrient-dense food.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:11):**  I believe that that is something that can and does happen,  but I'd love to hear your perspective.  What are you discovering in the research that you're doing?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:18):**  Well, the first thing that we are discovering  is that there's been too few studies  that have been looking to document that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:23):**  Most studies look at organic versus conventional,  and I've been on organic farms that have destroyed  their soil and conventional farms  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:30):**  that are pretty regenerative.  So I think that a lot of the meta studies  that are out there that are just pitched around  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:36):**  as organic, better than conventional  are kind of missing the real question.  And there's an example that hopefully will grow  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:43):**  into a study from Northern Oregon  that made a real impression on me last year,  where there was a farmer down there who,  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:46:50):**  I went down and talked at a conservation district  presentation, and there was a farmer who had done  a two-year running experiment with two fields  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:00):**  with the same cultivar of wheat planted in them,  both of which were no-till, and one of which  he used glyphosate fallow as a rotation,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:08):**  and the other in which he used, you know,  wheat in a complex mixture of cover crops  in between his wheat crops.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:13):**  So he wanted to test whether or not he could use  cover crops instead of glyphosate,  and what it would do for his yield.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:21):**  But he also was then asking the question,  he was asking me afterwards whether or not  I thought there'd be any difference in the mineral content  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:29):**  of the wheat grown in those two fields.  And I was like, well, let's test it, I don't know.  So we got samples from that harvest  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:36):**  from both of those fields, ran them through  mass spec and looked at the mineral micronutrient  differences, and the field that had just two years  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:45):**  of cover crops instead of glyphosate had anywhere  from 20 to 40, 50% higher mineral micronutrient levels  for the kind of things you might want,  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:47:54):**  like zinc, for example.  And, you know, I sort of came back and went, wow,  those are big jumps in numbers over two years.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:02):**  These are fields like right next to each other,  they have the same weather, in the same parent material,  same farmer, the only difference was how he treated  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:10):**  the land for two years.  And the only way that I can make sense out of that  is that by going through the diverse mixture  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:19):**  of cover crops, he was rebuilding the mycorrhizal fungi  and bacterial relationships in the soil  that allowed his crop to actually extract more zinc  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:29):**  from the mineral particles in the soil.  Because you couldn't change the zinc concentration  on the soil itself in two years unless you added  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:36):**  a bunch of zinc, which he didn't do.  But you could get more out of the soil  if you brought the biology back,  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:42):**  which you can do in a season or two.  So I've started to become very interested  in just how fast we could boost the mineral micronutrient  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:48:52):**  and phytochemical content of foods  using regenerative practices.  But frankly, we need more data, we need more comparisons.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:00):**  I think there's data out there in the world,  but not a lot of it has made it  into the scientific journals yet.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:07):**  I would agree, there's a lot of experiential data  that I think many farmers and agronomists have  that they've observed and can report on,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:14):**  but it's not peer reviewed, replicated studies, et cetera.  Yeah, and it would actually be great  to compile a bunch of that experiential stuff  
**[0:49:21-0:49:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:21):**  because the peer reviewed and replicated,  there's a reason for that and it's all very good,  but experience is worth something too.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:29):**  And I'd love to see more of that reported.  Absolutely.  David, what is a question you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:38):**  Oh, well when my band was playing next.  You play in a band?  Yeah, I play in two.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:45):**  One's called Big Dirt and I'm the guitar player.  I've done that for, we've been 20 years.  I can't imagine you had anything to do  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:49:52):**  with coming up with the name of that band now, did you?  Oh, actually, yeah.  But that one, it's a Seattle based rock, country-ish rock  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:50:03):**  band, Big Dirt.  We're on iTunes on all that kind of stuff.  And I'm also the bass player in a band, a new band  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:50:10):**  called Good Bones that you can find on Spotify, Good Bones.  We just put our first album out last month.  I'm the old guy in the band.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:50:19):**  It's a great band.  It's a Seattle pop rock band.  It's a lot of fun.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:50:23):**  Good, important to have fun.  Life is too short not to have fun.  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/a-geological-perspective-on-regenerative-agriculture-with-david-montgomery/#t=0:50:29):**  Wonderful.  David, thank you very much for joining us on the podcast  and for sharing your thoughts with our audience.

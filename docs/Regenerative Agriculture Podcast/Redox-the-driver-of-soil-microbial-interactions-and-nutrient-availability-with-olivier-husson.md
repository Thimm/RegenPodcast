**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:29):**  at agriculture and plant function from the perspective of biophysics rather than from  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:34):**  the perspective of biochemistry.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:36):**  Within this context, I was really interested in learning more about redox and soil, EH  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:43):**  and pH.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:44):**  In the literature review, I was not able to find very good information except for one  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:50):**  source.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:51):**  Olivier Husson wrote papers that were a voice of clarity in a wilderness of chaos.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:00:59):**  So Olivier has written a number of papers on the importance of redox and EH as drivers  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:07):**  of the soil microbial ecosystem and soil and plant interactions.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:12):**  And I'm delighted to have him here today.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:14):**  So Olivier, welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:16):**  You have a very interesting background.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:19):**  Can you tell us a bit about what has brought you to this research and how you came to be  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:25):**  working in this space?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:26):**  First, yes, let me say that I'm very proud to be asked and very glad to participate.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:34):**  I'm a big fan of your work, James.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:37):**  So it's a really, really pleasure.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:40):**  I'm an agronomist, French agronomist.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:43):**  I've been working in the tropics for more than 25 years.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:48):**  And one of the main crop I've been working with was rice.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:52):**  And rice can be grown in very different conditions.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:55):**  It can be grown, as most people know, with water in the field, in the paddy field.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:02):**  But it can also be grown as wheat and plant aerobic crop as any other crop.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:10):**  And I've been working on developing cropping system based on conservation agriculture,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:18):**  regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:20):**  And I've been working my early time for my PhD, especially in paddy fields where redox  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:28):**  chemistry is really fundamental and is very well known.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:33):**  So I asked myself why redox chemistry is so important in paddy field in anaerobic condition.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:43):**  And it would not be important in a plant aerobic field.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:48):**  And I started about 10 years ago to work on this aspect.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:54):**  And it's been quite interesting work.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:58):**  And then we can apply this to more aerobic crops, the most crops we have usually in our  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:06):**  systems.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:07):**  Olivier, there is a common perception that pH is one of the most important factors for  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:14):**  managing soil nutrient availability.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:17):**  And yet I've observed many environments and many fields where the pH was not where we  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:23):**  might have had expected it to be, but we had very good or very bad nutrient availability.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:29):**  That was really what led me to look at redox.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:32):**  What is the impact of redox on nutrient availability from the soil?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:36):**  I would say it's probably as important as pH.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:39):**  pH, of course, is a key factor for nutrient solubility, but it's not the only one.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:45):**  And if we look only at pH, we miss about half of the picture.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:51):**  In fact, we really need to assess both pH and redox potential at the same time.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:58):**  So redox potential is a measurement of the availability of the electrons as pH is a measurement  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:06):**  of the availability of protons.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:09):**  So if we draw a graph with pH and EH, we have a much better understanding of all the nutrient  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:19):**  solubility and all the plant nutrition we can get.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:24):**  I've actually, or people have asked me that question, I've said that understanding redox  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:30):**  and managing redox is perhaps even more important than managing soil pH.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:36):**  And one of the questions that comes up frequently, what is the impact of redox on nitrogen availability  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:42):**  specifically?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:47):**  You have both an impact of EH, redox potential and pH.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:52):**  In fact, the main component related nitrogen availability would be the oxygen and the hydrogen.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:01):**  So it's crossing at 45 degrees between pH and redox.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:08):**  It's really the gain of oxygen or the loss of hydrogen that will have the most impact.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:15):**  So it can be read both on pH and EH axis.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:22):**  So when you have low EH and low pH, you will have the main form would be ammonium.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:32):**  And when you have high EH and high pH, you will get mainly nitrates for the mineral forms  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:39):**  of nitrogen.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:42):**  There's a growing interest in developing microbial populations that can really suppress different  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:47):**  pathogens in the soil profile.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:49):**  What is the impact of redox and pH on the soil microbial community?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:54):**  So this is probably the most interesting thing.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:58):**  The microbial activity is very much impacted by EH and pH both.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:06):**  And in the other way, the microbial activity will have a huge impact on EH and pH.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:15):**  This control or alter the EH, pH of the environment to make it more profitable, more favorable  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:24):**  for their growth for thriving.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:26):**  So each species of microorganism will have a specific EH and pH zone where it will thrive.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:35):**  So some of them are very rather bequeathed.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:38):**  That means they can grow on a rather large range of EH and pH.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:43):**  But many, many microorganisms have a very narrow EH, pH of functioning.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:50):**  It's very much related to the energetic functioning and to the function they will fill in, especially  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:06:57):**  for the microbes involved in the nitrogen cycle.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:03):**  Nitrification will be at high pH, high EH, and the other way around nitrogen fixation  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:12):**  can be done only at very low EH.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:15):**  Wow.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:16):**  So if nitrogen fixation can only happen at very low EH, I think the experiences that  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:22):**  I've had and what I've observed generally soils tend to have commercially farm soils  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:27):**  tend to have a high EH.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:07:29):**  They tend to be fairly oxidized.

**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:15:25):**  So we need to restore the soil structure, to install plants that will improve the soil  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:15:32):**  structure, that will feed the biology in the soil.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:15:35):**  But for this, you need your plants to grow.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:15:38):**  And when the soil is imbalanced, the nutrients can be there in the soil, but not available  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:15:45):**  to the plants.

**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:19):**  the redox profile of the soil as well, particularly in the rhizosphere.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:23):**  Yes, totally right.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:26):**  It's clearly, the redox profile is coming from the photosynthesis mainly.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:31):**  The beginning of everything, it's the plant.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:34):**  We know how to grow plants without soil, but without the plants, the soil is just becoming  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:43):**  a desert.

**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:51):**  So it's the plant that makes the soil more than the soil that makes the plants, at least  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:16:56):**  in a system that works in a sustainable way.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:01):**  As soon as the plant is taking more nutrients and more energy from the soil and it provides  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:10):**  to the soil, the system will not be sustainable.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:14):**  You will lose energy in your soil.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:16):**  And this will also rapidly lead to favor pests and disease in different ways.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:23):**  That's another interesting aspect with adding redox to pH in the perspective is that we  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:30):**  can better understand in which condition the different kind of pests and the kind of disease  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:37):**  will thrive.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:38):**  And so we can identify the pH and pH condition in which the plant will be healthy.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:45):**  Olivier, I've just realized that you and I are somewhat familiar with this terminology,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:51):**  but we're using very different terms in different language.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:17:54):**  We speak about redox and pH and pH and reduction, oxidation.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:01):**  Some people speak of RH2.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:04):**  What are the meanings of all of these different terms?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:06):**  And what does for us as producers and agronomists, what do we really need to understand about  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:13):**  EH and pH?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:15):**  So it's rather simple in fact.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:18):**  pH measures the availability of proton, H+.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:23):**  EH would be a measurement of the availability of electrons.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:29):**  So if you make a diagram with pH on the X axis and EH on the Y axis, you will be able  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:37):**  to assess the different zones according to pH and EH.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:43):**  So low pH means a lot of proton and high proton availability, and that's acidic condition.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:18:53):**  High pH is a low availability of proton and it's alkaline or basic conditions.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:01):**  For redox, low EH means high electron availability because the electron is negatively charged.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:10):**  So low EH is related to a lot of electron, a lot of available electron.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:19):**  So inversely, so low EH mean reduced condition, it's the condition where energy is available  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:27):**  because there's plenty of electron.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:29):**  Inversely, high EH, high redox potential, EH stands for redox potential, is related  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:36):**  to low electron availability, so very low energy in the system.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:44):**  Then what's important to understand is that EH and pH are related, especially in organic  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:52):**  chemistry.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:53):**  And that's finally what will really make the difference to assess soil health and plant  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:19:58):**  health would be to look at the parameter.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:02):**  There's different ways we can do it.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:04):**  We can adjust EH to pH 7.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:08):**  We can also calculate the PE plus pH, which is an equivalent, PE is the electronic potential.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:16):**  It's just simply calculated from EH.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:21):**  So in fact, it's difficult to explain this without a graphic, but in fact, PE plus pH,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:27):**  if you look at it on this pH EH diagram, PE plus pH would be what drives you towards the  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:36):**  top right of this diagram.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:39):**  So high PE plus pH would correspond to low proton availability and low electron availability.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:49):**  On the other side, low PE plus pH would be high proton availability, high electron availability.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:20:58):**  So it's really where energy is gathered.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:02):**  It's where you have a lot of hydrogen and where you have very few oxygen.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:08):**  So it's very, very energetic compounds when you have such a low PE plus pH.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:16):**  And regarding the question to RH2, RH2 is two times PE plus pH.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:23):**  So it's the same kind of measurements.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:26):**  So broadly, the real accumulation of energy on a pH EH diagram, so with the proton on  
**[0:21:33-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:33):**  the X axis and the electron on the Y axis, the availability of energy, it's at low PE  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:41):**  plus pH, that mean on the bottom left of this diagram.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:45):**  And it's where photosynthesis is bringing you.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:49):**  It's how photosynthesis inject energy in all the system and on the opposite, when photosynthesis  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:21:56):**  is not working well, you're moving to the top right of this diagram where energy is  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:03):**  very weak, very limited.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:05):**  So if I'm understanding you correctly, then when you have photosynthesis, that contributes  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:10):**  to a reduced environment with an abundance of electrons.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:14):**  And this is something that I find particularly interesting is typically in agriculture and  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:20):**  in farming, the explanations have revolved around chemistry explanations.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:25):**  And I can't begin to recount the number of explanations that I have heard and read that  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:31):**  describe pH as a measurement of hydrogen, when in reality, we should look at it from  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:39):**  a biophysics perspective and not a biochemistry perspective of looking at individual elements.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:22:45):**  Yes, it's not, pH is not directly hydrogen, it's H plus, it's protons.

**[0:30:33-0:30:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:30:33):**  But it's rather freaky because pH and the pH naturally related, they are not independent.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:30:42):**  Finally, oxidations leads to acidification.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:30:48):**  So when water is losing electrons, getting oxidized, then it produce O2 and H+.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:30:59):**  So oxidation is related to acidification and inversely, reduction is related to alkalinization.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:08):**  So we have to be careful every time we are discussing with this kind of pH.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:15):**  It's not possible to assess pH without knowing the pH and inversely, knowing the pH has not

**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:35):**  And coming back to the plants and what are the impact of absorbing nitrates versus ammonium,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:42):**  the first impact is that the plants absorbing nitrates will need to transform, to reduce  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:49):**  it into ammonium before making amino acids to form proteins.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:31:56):**  So this is a huge energetic cost.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:02):**  Has eight electrons difference between nitrates and ammonium.

**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:10):**  So there's a few publication on this showing that a plant absorbing nitrates instead of  
**[0:32:16-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:16):**  ammonium will increase its root respiration by 10 to 15% to absorb because it's another  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:26):**  point is that roots is globally negatively charged, low redox potential.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:33):**  And the nitrates are negatively charged also.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:36):**  So there's a need to make very, it's an active absorption and it requires energy.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:43):**  So just the absorption of nitrates instead of ammonia will require energy and some part  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:32:53):**  also is transformed into ammonium in the roots of root respiration is largely increased by

**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:01):**  Most of it is for absorption and some parts for direct reduction of the nitrates into  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:07):**  ammonium in the soil.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:09):**  That's a first problem.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:11):**  Then a second problem is that the plant needs to reduce this ammonium, this nitrate into  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:18):**  ammonium and again, it's about 15% of its energy that will be spent for this.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:26):**  And the last part of it is that to do this, to transform nitrates into ammonium, the plant  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:33):**  will need a lot of water.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:35):**  So if there's plenty of water, it's good because the plant will absorb a lot of water.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:40):**  The cell will be to adjacent.

**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:47):**  and it's quite often a limiting factor in our agricultural system, the water use efficiency  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:33:53):**  can be reduced and the worst case can be in rice where the water use efficiency can be  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:00):**  divided by two.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:01):**  It would be just 50% of a plant absorbing ammonia.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:07):**  But if there's all this problem with nitrates, not everything is perfect with ammonium neither  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:13):**  because ammonium absorption will lead to release of protons.

**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:25):**  Then you will get aluminum toxicity, but also high ammonium content in the plants will make  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:34:32):**  it, will create toxicities.

**[1:05:16-1:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:16):**  between water and air, you can develop some magnetotactic bacteria that produce magnetite  
**[1:05:24-1:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:24):**  that are very paramagnetic.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:27):**  It's probably a research track we need to work on.

**[1:05:44-1:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:44):**  The better the soil structure, the more water-air interface we will get.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:49):**  So the highest probability we will get to develop this paramagnetic bacteria.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:05:55):**  These are hypotheses.

**[1:06:07-1:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:07):**  and things like this is probably also related to high electrical conductivity.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:13):**  Increasing the electrical conductivity probably makes it unbalanced regarding to the paramagnetism.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:22):**  We probably need to keep a balance between the two.

**[1:06:34-1:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:34):**  at low PE plus pH when increasing electrical conductivity tends to bring them to high PE  
**[1:06:42-1:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:42):**  plus pH to make them susceptible to insects and fungi and viruses.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:49):**  All these are hypotheses, but I suspect that this paramagnetism aspect to be a very powerful  
**[1:06:56-1:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:06:56):**  tool we could use with all the other tools, using all these microorganisms, boosting the  
**[1:07:02-1:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:02):**  photosynthesis through foliar applications.

**[1:07:12-1:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:12):**  we can improve all this picture by increasing the paramagnetism also.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:19):**  I'm pretty sure of this.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:21):**  Yeah, and we know that some of the gases such as oxygen is very highly paramagnetic and  
**[1:07:27-1:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:27):**  so when we have higher oxygen content soils that can increase the paramagnetism.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:30):**  So I also believe that it is a very important parameter.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:34):**  Olivier and I could continue this conversation for hours because the scope of his work and  
**[1:07:41-1:07:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:41):**  his research is so broad and so all encompassing and as he described, so unifying that it encompasses  
**[1:07:49-1:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:49):**  many different pieces.  
**[1:07:50-1:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:50):**  And so we've actually, earlier this week, we hosted a very long webinar with a group  
**[1:07:57-1:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:07:57):**  of people that was about six hours long altogether that is now available on the Academy, academy.regen.ag,

**[1:08:13-1:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:08:13):**  at plant and soil health and it's a very unfamiliar area for many people.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:08:19):**  So there's a lot of information, a lot of different perspectives that need to be shared.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:08:23):**  So this interview is just a taste of what is possible and the scope of Olivier's work.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:08:28):**  So on the webinar that is available on the Academy, we have all of the graphs and charts

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:54:03)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:32):**  Hi friends, welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:35):**  I'm back with Gary Zimmer for the second time.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:38):**  Gary is the first consultant that we've hosted  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:41):**  twice in a row.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:42):**  Gary's had a lot of thoughts and insights  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:44):**  that we wanted to follow up on  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:45):**  and get into some more detail.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:47):**  Pleasure to be here.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:48):**  And yes, we talked about some different topics and things.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:51):**  I look forward to it.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:52):**  I've been doing some thinking and searching  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:53):**  and hopefully we can share some information here  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:56):**  of my life experiences.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:58):**  Gary, one of the pieces that we spoke of a little bit,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:01):**  and this is fresh on my mind  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:02):**  because I had a webinar last night  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:05):**  where I got onto a soapbox a little bit,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:07):**  was nitrogen management and some of the challenges  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:10):**  and the opportunities with nitrogen management today  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:13):**  and ways that we can improve it.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:14):**  What have you learned about nitrogen management  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:17):**  and how we can do it better?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:19):**  So first I always start out and I tell farmers  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:22):**  that I don't know if they all realize that  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:23):**  nitrogen is a necessary evil,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:25):**  but it's also can cause a lot of trouble.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:27):**  We go way back into the early years  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:30):**  when everybody started growing corn  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:31):**  and they started using nitrogen  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:32):**  and the volume of residues grew twice as big.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:35):**  They said, man, this is gonna be great.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:36):**  We're really gonna grow organic matter now.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:39):**  Well, 50 years later, guess what?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:40):**  It went down.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:42):**  So excess nitrogen is always an issue out here  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:44):**  and they always blame tillage.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:46):**  But now even with no till and excess nitrogen,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:48):**  you burn up carbon.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:49):**  So you're always balancing that carbon to nitrogen  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:51):**  kind of a situation.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:52):**  So my whole thing on nitrogen is this.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:55):**  I think we can get people off the recommendations  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:58):**  at 1.1 pounds of nitrogen per bushel of corn,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:00):**  let's just pick on corn.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:01):**  I would say that we ought to be able to get that down  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:03):**  to 0.5 where a lot of people function.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:05):**  In order to do that,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:06):**  there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:08):**  There is a biological link  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:10):**  and they all like to talk about nitrogen credits,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:13):**  whether they be from a legume or a soybean  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:16):**  or whatever they're from.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:18):**  And I like to talk about the fact that  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:20):**  let's put it in the term digestibility and solubility  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:25):**  because we see, I was at a conference in Pennsylvania  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:29):**  a couple of years back and they had grown hairy batch  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:32):**  and it was huge and it was rank.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:34):**  And they said that we got all these nitrogen credits  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:36):**  and the corn was sick and yellow.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:37):**  They said, we don't understand,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:38):**  we got all these nitrogen credits.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:39):**  And next to it, they had a plot where they had clover  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:42):**  and alfalfa that they had worked down.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:44):**  It was only a foot tall and it was lush and green.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:46):**  And that corn was absolutely beautiful.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:48):**  It had a lot less nitrogen credits.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:50):**  So what's going on is the term digestibility.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:54):**  Of course, being a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:56):**  treating salt like treating cows is a reality.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:58):**  And so I said, you took that pure mature crop of batch,  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:02):**  ripe seeds and everything in it,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:04):**  and you fed it to a dairy cow,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:05):**  how much milk would you get?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:06):**  Not very much.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:07):**  Although you got a pile of nitrogen, it's not digestible.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:11):**  The young succulent clover was digestible.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:13):**  So I think that's a huge part of nitrogen management.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:16):**  Previous crops, that's why it was corn on corn  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:18):**  and you got corn stalks.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:19):**  Not only don't you have something that's highly digestible,  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:22):**  you don't have a very big nitrogen base.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:25):**  And so that's why starting that pre-digestion  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:26):**  a little bit earlier.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:27):**  So what this digestibility really is,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:30):**  is about managing biology.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:32):**  Bugs that eat that young succulent clover and alfalfa  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:35):**  are not the same ones that eat that mature rank thing.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:39):**  It's a whole lot easier to digest something  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:41):**  that's soluble than something that's complex carbons.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:43):**  And that's all a part of nitrogen management.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:46):**  So I tell people, first, you gotta get beyond the fact  
**[0:04:49-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:49):**  that it's a numbers game.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:50):**  It's not so many pounds of nitrogen so much.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:52):**  I've seen some pretty incredible crops growing  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:54):**  with pretty low levels of purchased nitrogen.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:57):**  Nobody grew it without nitrogen.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:59):**  They grew it without purchased nitrogen.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:01):**  There's a huge difference.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:02):**  And so my whole thing is this, that as time goes on,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:06):**  because we farm organically,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:08):**  we actually do soil nitrogen tests  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:10):**  and we look at how we manage to cover crops.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:12):**  And we always say, you gotta have a beautiful, lush,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:14):**  high digestible, high kind of a nitrogen cover crop.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:17):**  It could even be a grass as long as it's lush  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:19):**  and taken down at the right stage.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:21):**  There's a lot of milk produced on high digestible grasses.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:24):**  First, you gotta get that.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:25):**  If you don't have that good stand,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:27):**  then how do you back down on nitrogen?  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:28):**  I think there's now a couple of people out here,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:31):**  scientific researchers,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:33):**  some with the U.S. Department of Agriculture  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:34):**  and one from Australia that are now convinced  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:36):**  that as time goes on,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:38):**  once you start backing off of this soluble nitrogen thing,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:40):**  you'll start to have more biology build up in the soil  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:44):**  that actually can pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:46):**  Can we propagate that?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:47):**  It's almost like saying,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:48):**  if I put a lot of nitrogen in front of an alfalfa  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:51):**  or a soybean crop, will I get as many nodules?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:53):**  I think there's pretty good evidence that you won't,  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:56):**  because the plant determines the soil life  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:58):**  and there's a bath and nitrogen, they don't get it.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:00):**  So this whole nitrogen management thing,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:03):**  I think gets down to our biology is the link  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:07):**  and we can actually grow more nitrogen.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:08):**  That's the only thing we can grow.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:10):**  Other inputs need to be provided  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:12):**  and we gotta have these beautiful, healthy soils  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:14):**  that gotta be fed and fed the kind of materials  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:17):**  that digest well and give us out nitrogen.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:20):**  Now going through that all,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:21):**  how does a farmer deal with that?  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:23):**  We'll just talk conventionally,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:24):**  there's a lot of guys going to the organic world  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:26):**  and they wanna buy chicken manure or something  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:27):**  because they think they gotta put pound for pound  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:29):**  with the nitrogen on here  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:30):**  and I don't think they really understand that well enough.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:32):**  Well, let's just talk about a conventional one.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:35):**  My thought would be on a conventional farm  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:37):**  that best way to be is whatever we got  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:40):**  for our little starters  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:41):**  or stuff we put out there in the beginning  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:42):**  and depending upon the previous crop and whatnot,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:45):**  I would start out by side dressing my nitrogen.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:48):**  I wanna be able to split my nitrogen  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:49):**  and I tell farmers,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:50):**  nitrogen is the easiest thing in the world.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:52):**  If you're conventional and we're back on corn again  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:55):**  and I got whatever I start out with  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:56):**  and then I wanna come along and side dress them  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:58):**  and hopefully I got good enough and big enough equipment,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:01):**  I can side dress it even later season,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:03):**  I can vary my rates.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:05):**  I can test out what my farm,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:07):**  how it responds to nitrogen.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:09):**  Understanding that the longer I'm at this,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:12):**  that's why I can't do it just once  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:14):**  and say, oh, my farm needs 30 gallons of 32% or whatever  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:17):**  is to say I gotta constantly keep testing it  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:20):**  because as time goes on and my soils get better  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:22):**  because I wanna use as little as possible  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:25):**  and I wanna put it when and where I need it  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:27):**  and I wanna use it for a purpose.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:29):**  So splitting the nitrogen  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:30):**  and then I'd like to add a carbon to it.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:32):**  So our whole preferred thing is we like our molasses  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:34):**  or I could put a humate.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:36):**  I wanna put something to kind of buffer it out.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:38):**  If I was gonna use a dry,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:40):**  I would use some ammonium sulfate,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:42):**  possibly some, we use ESN,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:44):**  environmentally smart polymer coated nitrogen  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:47):**  on a lot of our conventional farms  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:48):**  or I would use a sulfa  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:50):**  because sulfa can replace part of our nitrogen.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:53):**  So this whole nitrogen thing I think can be made simpler,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:55):**  although I went through this maybe too fast,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:59):**  but it can also be a fairly simple out here on this thing.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:03):**  Just like we had this meeting the other day  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:05):**  and this guy's a hog farmer  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:07):**  and he keeps getting a response  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:09):**  from putting on more nitrogen.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:10):**  I finally said to the guys,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:11):**  maybe it's not the nitrogen,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:12):**  maybe it's the carbon dioxide that's giving him a response.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:16):**  So when he puts on this extra nitrogen,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:19):**  later in the season, he still got residues.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:20):**  You know that Francis Childs,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:21):**  the first guy to grow that 400 bushel corn,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:23):**  what did he say?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:24):**  If you're gonna grow 400 bushel corn,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:26):**  you probably should follow 500 bushel corn  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:28):**  because you need those residues  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:29):**  for the carbon dioxide release.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:31):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:33):**  I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:34):**  I still see farmers applying nitrogen in the fall  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:38):**  and that to me is,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:42):**  I'm just gonna say exactly what I think about it.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:44):**  That is dumb.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:45):**  That's the dumbest thing.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:46):**  I cannot see that making agronomic sense  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:49):**  from any perspective, no matter how you look at it.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:51):**  And I was thinking about this to a grower  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:54):**  and I was asked the question as well,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:55):**  why do we get such a big response from nitrogen applications?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:59):**  I believe a large part of it  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:00):**  is coming from the carbon dioxide,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:02):**  from the CO2 response,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:03):**  because nitrogen is going to solubilize our organic matter,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:08):**  which going back to a point that you made at the beginning  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:11):**  is why have we lost organic matter  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:15):**  with continued increase nitrogen applications  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:17):**  over the last 50 years?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:23):**  Yeah, because Roy's balancing that carbon nitrogen ratio,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:26):**  that basis.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:27):**  And the other thing is when the guy puts that nitrogen  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:29):**  on the fall and I don't disagree with you,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:31):**  and I struggled with this one for a little while,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:33):**  because the way I say,  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:34):**  well, let's say you're growing corn on corn,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:36):**  let's start the digestion process,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:38):**  because if I can get that digested down,  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:40):**  I cut down on my disease and insects.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:41):**  I said, but you're boiling carbon dioxide  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:44):**  off into the atmosphere and there's no plant to absorb it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:47):**  If you want to drive your higher yields,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:49):**  you want to save all the carbon you can to release it  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:51):**  during the growing season,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:52):**  when the corn needs all that carbon dioxide.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:55):**  But putting a little bit, like we're saying,  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:57):**  even if it's a light coat of manure,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:59):**  or maybe only 10, 15 units of nitrogen,  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:02):**  we like to maybe add a biological to it.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:04):**  Maybe we'd add a little sugars to it with our molasses,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:07):**  and we'd spray that on those corn stalks  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:09):**  right behind the harvest and lightly work them in the ground  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:12):**  so the digestion process starts,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:14):**  and then the carbon and a little bit of nitrogen we add  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:17):**  can go into bodies of bugs,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:18):**  and it's not really a boil off of carbon dioxide  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:20):**  in the atmosphere.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:21):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:22):**  Yeah, that's different from applying 100 pounds  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:24):**  of nitrogen in the fall.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:26):**  Yes.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:27):**  And I think the other thing on this,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:28):**  that's why nitrogen is such a,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:30):**  it's not, that's why it's not a numbers game.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:32):**  I tell people, just think,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:33):**  if you're a farm, every year it should get better,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:35):**  and once you get down to having a huge population  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:37):**  of earthworms doing all that digestion,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:39):**  there's 72% protein, there are 11% nitrogen.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:43):**  Our numbers that I read, and I don't know how accurate,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:45):**  maybe someone's gonna argue with the scientific behind it,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:48):**  but 25 worms in a cubic foot,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:50):**  we always said is 80 units of nitrogen,  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:52):**  just some old dead nine worms,  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:54):**  if they're there throughout the season.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:55):**  So now how do you put that in your formula?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:58):**  Exactly, and so you've mentioned that comment  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:00):**  a couple of times, that a pound of nitrogen  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:02):**  is not a pound of nitrogen is not all the same,  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:03):**  and this is something that we've observed as well,  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:06):**  is that there's this idea that it takes so many units  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:08):**  of nitrogen to grow a bunch of grain crop,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:11):**  and yet we sometimes see pretty extraordinary yields  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:14):**  with sustained nitrogen levels in the soil  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:17):**  without those volumes of nitrogen application,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:20):**  or even those volumes of nitrogen credits showing up.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:22):**  How does that work?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah, and that's exactly right,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:25):**  and it's because there's this biology link,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:27):**  and we're getting it there, and someone says,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:29):**  well, if I build my organic matter,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:30):**  I'll get more nitrogen, and he says,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:31):**  well, you know, that might be a 10-year project,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:33):**  and we can have responses really quick,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:36):**  because we just transitioned some more land organically.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:38):**  Now we grew oats, we left the straw out there,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:41):**  we underseeded with clover and alfalfa,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:44):**  we did it two years in a row.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:46):**  So last year we worked that all back in,  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:48):**  and just like people put on manure,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:49):**  and they said, well, you only can count 40% of the credits  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:52):**  for your nitrogen on that manure.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:53):**  I said, what if I did it three years in a row?  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:55):**  So last year we put the cover crop back in the ground  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:57):**  along with the straw, which would help build up  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:00):**  my organic matters in my soil possibly,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:02):**  or at least gives me more fiber structural things  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:05):**  to help improve my soil structure.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:07):**  Now we do it again this year,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:09):**  and then that clover and everything is out there right now,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:11):**  we'll mow it down this fall.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:12):**  Next spring when that gets a foot tall,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:14):**  we'll likely work that in,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:16):**  I'm a real believer in my shallow incorporating,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:18):**  and then we'll plant the crop.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:20):**  So how much nitrogen have I really built?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:22):**  Some came from last year, some came from this year.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:25):**  I got some older stuff,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:26):**  and I got some fresh succulent stuff I'm breaking down,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:29):**  so I got almost a time to release nitrogen.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:31):**  Now we probably will put a little dairy manure on  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:33):**  because we're a dairy farm,  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:34):**  but we will not see any issues that I know of  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:38):**  that we never see yellowing corn,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:40):**  we never see nitrogen is not our limiting factor.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:43):**  It's one of the pieces that we've observed as well.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:45):**  I can't even begin to describe how many farms  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:47):**  we begin working with,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:48):**  and of course we're working with sap analysis.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:51):**  We start working with sap analysis  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:52):**  and the plants tell us, and the sap analysis,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:55):**  and the lower older leaves  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:56):**  that they don't need more nitrogen.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:58):**  Many cases after we've cut nitrogen applications  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:01):**  by anywhere from 30 to 60%, huge numbers,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:05):**  where we're dramatically reducing nitrogen applications.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:08):**  And I think this goes to atmospheric nitrogen fixation  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:12):**  and the fact that that might not happen as well  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:16):**  if you apply a lot of nitrogen upfront.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:18):**  So I guess the question that I have in that for you is,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:21):**  what have you observed or what have you experienced  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:23):**  with atmospheric nitrogen absorption?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:26):**  Well, that's like I said, it's a hard one.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:28):**  I'm totally convinced that there's certain organisms  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:32):**  that this whole system was designed to work  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:33):**  for a while in the beginning.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:34):**  There's certain opportunities  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:36):**  that the plants determine soil life,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:38):**  and if they need more nitrogen out here,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:39):**  there are certain organisms  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:41):**  that are gonna rise to the occasion,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:42):**  especially if we got a base of carbon to digest from.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:45):**  Now that all takes time, and as time goes on,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:48):**  my observations were that our need for nitrogen  
**[0:13:51-0:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:51):**  also goes down.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:51):**  We actually cleared some land that was in Christmas trees,  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:54):**  which was 20-year-old pine trees,  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:57):**  and so there's nothing been grown on it  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:58):**  for a long period of time,  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:59):**  and it was already could be certified organic.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:01):**  And so we actually put a fair bit of manure out there  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:03):**  and grow corn, and guess what happened?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:04):**  It turned yellow.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:06):**  Now, the bottom ends, it wasn't a disaster,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:08):**  but even putting on manure nitrogen,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:11):**  but I guarantee you by next year or the year after,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:13):**  give us three years and that'll all go away.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:16):**  So what happened?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:17):**  We had to change the biology,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:19):**  had to rise to the occasion to fill in the gap  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:21):**  that right now we don't have enough exchangeable nitrogen.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:25):**  One of the pieces that I see being important  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:27):**  to build exchangeable nitrogen, which you've mentioned,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:29):**  is that we talk about building biology,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:30):**  but we also have to build a food source for that biology,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:33):**  which is not just nitrogen,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:34):**  but really the soluble carbon, digestible carbon,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:36):**  which you referenced a couple of times.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:38):**  Mm-hmm.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:39):**  If you go together.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:40):**  Yep, that makes, yeah, that's why it's perfect sense.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:42):**  So I go back and I tell the farmers,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:44):**  it's really quite simple to manage nitrogen.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:46):**  You treat a crop that needs nitrogen  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:48):**  like you treat a cow given 100 pounds of milk.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:50):**  If you're not a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:52):**  those guys pretty well got it figured out.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:54):**  What kind of feed you got to feed that cow?  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:56):**  Just go search it out.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:57):**  If you want to grow a legume or a soybean crop,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:00):**  you feed that like you feed a dry cow or an old beef cow.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:02):**  You just kind of keep it around and keeping it alive  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:05):**  and you use less soluble nutrients  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:07):**  because you don't want that animal to have all this gain  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:09):**  and excess energy and digestibility and protein  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:12):**  if she's just not performing well.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:13):**  So I think if we put that mindset onto the soils  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:17):**  and look at them and quote,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:18):**  oh, that's a grass or a legume, I don't really care  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:21):**  as much as I do that digestibility,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:22):**  but this is the hardest topic to get across to farmers.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:26):**  They just don't care.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:27):**  They have a really hard time grasping this thing  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:29):**  and I think it's common sense.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:32):**  And it's so much fun when it starts working.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:35):**  Yes, it sure is, it sure is.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:37):**  Let's talk a little bit about  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:39):**  actual nitrogen applications on commercial farms.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:41):**  You mentioned stabilizing nitrogen by adding carbon,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:44):**  by adding sulfur, perhaps using ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:48):**  What are some of the common tools that you use  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:50):**  to stabilize nitrogen applications  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:52):**  to make sure you get the greatest crop response?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:55):**  So first of all, if we go to a farmer  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:56):**  and they've been just putting on,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:57):**  whether it be urea or even some anhydrous,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:00):**  we pretty well don't work with too many that do that,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:02):**  but there's always a few that are hard to wean.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:05):**  And if they all say they're just using nitrogen,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:08):**  the first thing we want to do,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:09):**  because ammonium sulfate is more of a slow release,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:11):**  time release, there's some carbon with it.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:13):**  We tell that that you can replace 25 units of your nitrogen  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:16):**  right up front by using sulfur.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:19):**  Both nitrogen and sulfur have a similar effect.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:21):**  They have that greening effect on plants.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:23):**  And so whether that's all 100% scientifically in line  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:26):**  with what people think, but we're pretty well convinced  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:29):**  that if a guy's putting on straight urea,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:31):**  and if I take out a hundred pounds urea,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:34):**  which is 46 units of nitrogen,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:36):**  and I put in ammonium sulfate,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:38):**  which if you add the nitrogen and sulfur together, it's 45.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:42):**  21 in nitrogen and 24 sulfur.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:45):**  So we treat those first hundred pounds ammonium sulfate  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:48):**  as we would a hundred pounds of urea and we just switch.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:52):**  So now we've reduced this nitrogen,  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:54):**  but we haven't really induced any effect yet.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:57):**  So then how do I make urea more stable?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:00):**  That's why we struggle with that one a little bit.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:02):**  So I like to use a little,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:03):**  our upfront nitrogen preferably is ammonium sulfate.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:07):**  If a farmer's not set up to come back and side dress  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:09):**  or do some of the other things we'd like to do,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:12):**  then we use the ESN and that's that polymer coated urea  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:15):**  cause that gives us a bigger time release  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:17):**  cause we're trying to get,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:18):**  I don't wanna bathe that thing with nitrogen upfront.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:21):**  Our preferred thing come back and side dressed  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:24):**  and we make a molasses product called Boost,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:27):**  which is really, it's got a lot of sugars in it,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:30):**  some molasses and there's some other things  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:32):**  and there's some yeast and stuff to help stabilize that.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:34):**  So I'm not one that wants to put an inhibitor in my nitrogen  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:37):**  cause it doesn't just inhibit that nitrogen transition.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:41):**  All these chemistries that we add to the soil  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:43):**  have other side effects.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:45):**  It's just, it's more to it than,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:47):**  oh, I'm just gonna slow my nitrogen release  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:48):**  cause it's an anti-biological.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:50):**  I'm uncomfortable with those.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:52):**  I'd rather put in, I could do some humic acid.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:55):**  I could put in something that's gonna give that nitrogen  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:57):**  something to bind you.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:58):**  Now the sugars don't perform like the humic acids.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:02):**  The humic acids in my opinion are a sponge  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:04):**  and a holder of nitrogen.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:06):**  Whereas molasses is actually a feeder of biology  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:10):**  and I'm trying and putting a sugar,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:12):**  it's kind of buckling around,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:12):**  trying to get that nitrogen as fast as I can  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:16):**  into the bodies of bugs.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:18):**  And so then I got it stabilized  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:19):**  in a carbon biological cycle.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:22):**  And then of course we always add some thiosulfate  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:24):**  and make sure we got a little sulfur  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:25):**  cause that helps stabilize that nitrogen.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:28):**  And then putting on both sides of the row,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:30):**  splitting it out a couple of times is certainly well,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:32):**  you've seen a lot of farmers now set up to do that.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:35):**  Having high boys and going in their late season  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:37):**  with their wide drops or whatever they do  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:39):**  to put on a little extra nitrogen  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:41):**  is a way that we can get most efficient  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:42):**  cause they're all worried,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:43):**  oh, if I don't put a lot on early,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:45):**  it's gonna get away from me and I'll miss it.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:47):**  So I think we got tools and equipment  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:48):**  to be able to do that.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:49):**  Depends on how the farm is set up.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:51):**  So I don't know if you have other things  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:53):**  besides the sugars and the humics  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:55):**  that you would add to nitrogen,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:56):**  but that's kind of the camp that we stick in.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:59):**  I think doing nitrogen applications later  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:01):**  when the plants are taller,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:02):**  just makes very good agronomic sense  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:04):**  almost irregardless of what you're describing  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:06):**  because how much nitrogen does a six inch tall corn plant  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:09):**  really actually need?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:10):**  Yep.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:11):**  And then I tell everybody my story about plants  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:14):**  and life is this, everything is basically lazy.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:16):**  And so what'll happen, we get all that nitrogen,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:18):**  we get this big top lush green growth,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:21):**  but the roots got lazy because all the nutrients were soluble  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:24):**  and they were stuck right next to that four little plants.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:26):**  So later on, when it runs out,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:28):**  he hasn't built the root base  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:30):**  and we may have burned up some of that carbon  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:32):**  we wanted to save the later,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:33):**  but they haven't really set themselves up for what's coming  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:35):**  because they have no idea.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:37):**  They go, wow, this is the way the world is.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:38):**  I don't need to grow that big,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:39):**  that bigger, better root system  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:41):**  so I can tap into more things.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:43):**  And so that bigger root system now,  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:45):**  the plant puts its exudates in the soil  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:47):**  and is again feeding bacteria,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:48):**  which we should be able to scrounge  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:49):**  and get more nitrogen availability.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:52):**  And there's not only the root system effect,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:54):**  but also the effect on biology,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:56):**  which you mentioned earlier,  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:57):**  is that when in the case of nitrogen application,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:00):**  you may not get legume nodulation.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:01):**  And I think the same thing happens with azotobacter  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:05):**  and other bacteria that are known to have the capacity  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:07):**  to fix atmospheric nitrogen.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:10):**  That isn't likely to happen in an environment  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:12):**  where there is already an overabundant supply of nitrogen  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:15):**  that is going to suppress biology.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:16):**  Yep, that's exactly the way we feel about it also.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:22):**  Yeah, and to your earlier question about,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:26):**  we also use and make recommendations for sulfur  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:31):**  using lots of thiosol in liquid nitrogen applications  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:34):**  and humic acids.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:35):**  We typically use humic acids at about 3% of the solution.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:40):**  We find that that's enough to really hold and stabilize  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:44):**  the nitrogen.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:45):**  Yes, and so on.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:47):**  Yeah, and we will actually,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:48):**  because obviously in the molasses,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:50):**  we tell the farmers it's an easy way to do us  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:52):**  in a side dressing 32%.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:54):**  We'll take, if they're putting on 20 gallons,  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:56):**  we like to treat the solution and take out 10%.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:00):**  Now that's about a 30% sugar kind of a thing in that molasses  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:04):**  and there's other things in this water.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:05):**  So we actually tell the farmers,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:07):**  if you're set up the side dress 30 gallons of nitrogen,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:09):**  and that's what you're gonna do,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:10):**  take out 10% of that solution  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:12):**  and put 10% of this boost molasses mix in  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:14):**  and you'll achieve,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:16):**  now we reduced your nitrogen a little bit.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:18):**  We've never seen anybody go backwards doing that.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:21):**  And a lot of times they'll move forward  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:22):**  because now we've actually done them a favor  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:24):**  and we actually started reducing his nitrogen.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:27):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:29):**  Have you used any molybdenum with the side dress  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:33):**  or are you looking at molybdenum at all  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:35):**  for the effect that it can have on nitrogen in the plant?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:37):**  As a company, we don't really distribute  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:39):**  and work with molybdenum.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:40):**  Years ago, I put a lot of work and effort into it  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:42):**  on molybdenum and of course, products like that,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:46):**  Idaho phosphate that we've been marketing,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:49):**  everybody doesn't use it as a pretty good source of molybdenum.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:51):**  I'm not saying it shouldn't be done.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:53):**  I think to me, the future lies  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:56):**  in what we're doing out here, these guys,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:57):**  we'll start putting a starter fertilizer down that road  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:00):**  that's got just NP and K in it.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:02):**  It's gonna have that little cholesterol mix  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:04):**  like I talk about.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:05):**  It's gonna have root stimulants,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:07):**  it's gonna have some maybe some Calp,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:08):**  and it's gonna have some maybe some sugars  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:09):**  and it's gonna maybe have in some plant compounds  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:12):**  and maybe some of these very unique compounds  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:14):**  like molybdenum and things belong  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:17):**  because I got such a small amount  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:19):**  that they belong in that little trench  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:20):**  when I'm starting that thing out,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:21):**  some root plant protective kind of compounds.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:24):**  I think we can do more in that root zone at planting  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:27):**  or that little cholesterol mix zone.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:29):**  And but as a company, we have not moved into that category.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:33):**  And now we do use a lot of natural mined materials  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:36):**  for our fertilizers,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:37):**  which some of them have some of those rare kind  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:39):**  of minerals in them.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:40):**  I know one of our topics we're gonna talk about  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:42):**  was trace mentholseed because if you look at the earth  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:45):**  and what's been marketed,  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:46):**  whether the companies are real or not,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:47):**  within the years ago, we had planters and longfoscals  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:51):**  and we had all these different compounds, sulfur plus,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:53):**  I don't know, zeolites are a little bit different,  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:55):**  but these mined materials,  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:56):**  there's certain mines out here that people search for  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:59):**  to find those little rare, what's in there after?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:01):**  Maybe some of those little rare minerals isn't molybdenum.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:03):**  You actually add it on your guys into the fertilizer mixes?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:08):**  We do and we've observed this very interesting effect  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:12):**  when we're looking at sap analysis,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:15):**  we've observed that there is this trio  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:17):**  of three different nutrients,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:19):**  magnesium and sulfur and molybdenum.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:21):**  When we look at plant saps, we're measuring,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:24):**  we measure ammonium and we measure nitrate  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:26):**  and we measure total nitrogen  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:28):**  and our desire, our goal from a plant health perspective  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:31):**  is to have an adequate or a generous supply  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:34):**  of total nitrogen with a non-detectable  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:36):**  on nitrate and ammonium.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:37):**  We want those numbers to be zero.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:40):**  Wow.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:40):**  We can get there very reliably  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:43):**  when we have magnesium and sulfur and molybdenum,  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:47):**  all three at adequate levels,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:48):**  but if one of them is missing, nitrate levels go up.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:52):**  Of course, it's always difficult,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:54):**  it's a juggling act to get all that exact into that plant  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:57):**  and I guess that's where you got to recognize  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:59):**  that a lot of the farmers we work with are,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:02):**  I'm not being critical or anything,  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:04):**  I'm saying they're in kindergarten  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:05):**  as far as understanding all these things.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:07):**  If we can just get them to run better sources of minerals  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:11):**  and look at a few more things  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:12):**  and do just a few of these practices  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:14):**  like even putting a cover crop in is a giant step forward.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:17):**  So whether we take it to this level or not,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:19):**  I think it's gonna go there eventually  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:21):**  and I respect what you're all trying to do,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:23):**  but I think for the base of the customers we work with,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:26):**  that might be a little more shocking than they can tolerate.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:29):**  So we've been talking about nitrogen management  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:34):**  and a few moments ago,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:36):**  we were describing humic substances.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:38):**  One of the pieces that you and I spoke about  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:40):**  in our prior conversation  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:42):**  was the idea of delivering nutrients much more efficiently  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:47):**  and much more effectively using carbon-based fertilizers.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:50):**  And I think this ties in directly  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:52):**  to our nitrogen management conversation  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:54):**  because really what we're talking about  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:56):**  is the need to have a balanced carbon and nitrogen ratio  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:00):**  in the soil profile and to hold that and stabilize it  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:02):**  and keep the plant available.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:04):**  And how does that concept  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:07):**  of carbon stabilizing nutrients  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:11):**  transfer to other nutrients in addition to nitrogen?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:14):**  How do you utilize that?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:16):**  Yes, and I think back to my little word of digestibility,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:18):**  that carbon to nitrogen thing,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:20):**  and we're saying that in order to have the biology  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:22):**  really do its work and break it down,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:24):**  trace minerals, so what about all the other minerals  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:26):**  and how do we get them available?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:27):**  Some of them are just like that malevolent.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:29):**  They're pretty small additions.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:30):**  So how do we take that addition in very small amounts  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:33):**  and make sure we can actually get it plant active  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:36):**  and plant available?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:37):**  And so balancing carbon and nitrogen  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:40):**  and just burning up all my carbon,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:41):**  those nutrients then get lost or mixed  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:43):**  or tied up or hooked somewhere.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:45):**  So that's the whole other thing with carbon.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:47):**  I like that whether it be within a plant,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:50):**  let's say I just put some of this stuff out there  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:52):**  and grow a plant and then manage the digestibility  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:54):**  of that plant, I'm now gonna be more time-released  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:57):**  and I'm gonna be distributed better.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:59):**  We had a farmer the other day was asking  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:02):**  if he's growing his cover crop now,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:03):**  if he should put trace minerals on it.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:05):**  I said, the cover crop is not a cover.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:07):**  It's not covering anything.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:08):**  It's actually a crop that you're using  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:10):**  to distribute minerals for the next crop  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:13):**  and you're gonna manage it accordingly.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:14):**  So that nitrogen to carbon ratio comes in line  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:17):**  in terms of digestibility.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:19):**  If I'm way too high on carbon, low on nitrogen,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:21):**  it's gonna take a long time to break down.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:23):**  I can set myself up for disease in insects  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:25):**  and I don't get my availability of my minerals.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:27):**  So if I get that high level of mineral uptake,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:30):**  see me as a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:32):**  that's how I got introduced to some of these things  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:34):**  way back 40 years ago was to create better feed for cows.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:38):**  When we started, I spent nine years at the university  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:41):**  balancing rations based on a set of numbers.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:44):**  If you turn to get better digestible feed  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:46):**  and the mineral levels in that feed are higher,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:49):**  that high digestible feed might have 95% of that mineral  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:53):**  available to the cow.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:54):**  The stuff you buy in stones and bags  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:57):**  might only be 40% available.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:59):**  So that's where we started balancing rations to cows.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:02):**  I think it's the same thing with soils.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:04):**  We'd say, look, once you start getting  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:06):**  these high mineralized digestible  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:08):**  and you're managing that just to build those feeds,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:09):**  you can actually cheat on numbers  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:12):**  and cut down what you apply by at least 25%.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:15):**  So they would back off that ration numbers  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:17):**  with a lot of success once they started getting  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:19):**  this minerals mixed in high digestible feed.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:22):**  So in the soil, it would work the same way.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:24):**  That was why it takes several years  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:26):**  to really get this thing to crank out to the level.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:28):**  I know for us as an organic farmer,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:31):**  the two years in transition from conventional to organic,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:34):**  all we do is re-mineralize and grow cover crops  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:37):**  to get that soil built up.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:38):**  So when it is organic, it's always perfect.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:41):**  But we started this whole thing  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:42):**  about getting a higher nutrient exchange,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:44):**  but it's all based on first getting them out there  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:46):**  and then getting them in a form where they go  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:47):**  through their carbon biological cycles  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:49):**  with plants and biology.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:51):**  Essentially, Gary, what you're describing is  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:54):**  farmers should grow their cover crops  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:56):**  as a ration for soil biology,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:00):**  similar to growing a ration for ruminant biology.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:04):**  So in saying that, do you believe that farmers  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:06):**  should manage their cover crops as carefully  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:09):**  and as well as they do their actual crops  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:10):**  that they're growing?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:11):**  Yes, I think those cover crops need to be treated as,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:14):**  they are my reserve to hold and release  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:17):**  the kind of minerals that I wanna release.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:19):**  And so then this guy the other day, he said,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:22):**  well, I don't, I like using my homogenized trace minerals.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:24):**  He said, well, I don't have those available.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:26):**  He said, what if I went and just sprayed some on  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:28):**  my cover crop?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:30):**  I said, why?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:30):**  Obviously, whether they get absorbed or where they go,  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:32):**  I think that's certainly not a bad idea.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:35):**  And then he said, well, can I use a cheaper source of those?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:37):**  I said, well, they still gotta be able to get  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:39):**  into the plant and I'm not sure.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:40):**  We like our sulfate trace minerals or our chelates.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:43):**  I'm not sure how that would really work,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:44):**  but it starts that process.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:47):**  The last thing I want them to do is spend money  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:49):**  and buy something and dump it on the land  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:50):**  and just another stone added to another big pile of stuff  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:53):**  that we already got laying in our soil.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:55):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:57):**  What I can say is what we have observed  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:00):**  is our most successful growers,  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:02):**  those who have regenerated soil health the most rapidly  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:05):**  and have achieved the greatest crop responses,  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:08):**  manage their cover crops as carefully  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:10):**  as they do their crops.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:11):**  And they'll use foliar sprays.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:13):**  They will put on fertilizers.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:14):**  They will manage those crops as well as they do the crops  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:17):**  that they're actually harvesting.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:19):**  Yep, I'm 100% in agreement.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:21):**  That's what I tell people.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:21):**  I was just at some farms and they had some really poor stands  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:24):**  of alfalfa and their cover crops were half a stand  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:27):**  and they said, we're not getting a success.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:29):**  I said, but you don't really have a very good cover crop  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:32):**  or a very good alfalfa stand to work back into the ground  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:34):**  to feed the soil.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:35):**  If your stand of alfalfa is half gone,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:37):**  so obviously you're not gonna get all the benefits.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:40):**  I think you're absolutely right.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:41):**  I think that's a huge ticket to using cover crops  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:44):**  or even our rotation.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:46):**  See, we as a dairy farm,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:47):**  we only leave our alfalfa in one or two years.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:49):**  We like to take that beautiful lush stand  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:51):**  of alfalfa grasses and let it get up  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:54):**  to that high digestible stage and work it back in the soil.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:56):**  And everybody's, oh my gosh, I could feed that to my cows.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:59):**  And I said, well, I am feeding it to my soil livestock  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:01):**  and they need to be fed just as well as your cows do.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:03):**  Yeah, they certainly do.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:07):**  And I can imagine that would be difficult  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:10):**  for some farmers to learn how to do.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:13):**  I had an old neighbor, old farmer, older than me.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:16):**  I mean, this goes to his 90 and he stopped in one day  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:18):**  and he said, Zimmer, you're gonna wear those soils out.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:21):**  You're constantly growing something.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:23):**  I didn't know what to say.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:27):**  I said, yeah, but I'm putting it back.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:29):**  I'm not taking it all.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:30):**  And then they got the mentality,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:31):**  you plant something, you take it.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:35):**  So you've spoken a couple of times about trace minerals.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:37):**  What is the optimal way to apply trace minerals  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:40):**  from your perspective to get the greatest crop response?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:43):**  Yes, so what my whole thing is gonna,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:46):**  because we're putting on in such small amounts.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:48):**  First, we gotta look at sources.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:49):**  We got our oxides, our sulfates, our chelates,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:52):**  and then we got them mixed with other things.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:53):**  And so, see trace minerals in such a small amount  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:55):**  to put a pound of zinc oxide, zinc oxide,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:58):**  I'm not sure what I get out of that.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:00):**  Let's just take a better source like sulfate.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:02):**  I put a pound of the acre.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:03):**  I got one little crystal of zinc sulfate per square foot.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:07):**  Now that's from measurements actually,  
**[0:31:10-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:10):**  but it's kind of crazy.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:10):**  So then I said, what if I did a homogenized blend  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:13):**  and I took my array of trace minerals,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:15):**  let's say zinc, manganese, iron, copper, boron,  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:18):**  and we do it in a base of natural rock materials  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:21):**  where there's other minerals like there's nickel,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:23):**  there's silica, there's all kinds of other things  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:25):**  that are in that source.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:27):**  And then we add humates and we homogenize.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:29):**  And so that whole mix, every BB's got the same analysis.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:32):**  Now, if I put on 25 pounds of that per acre,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:35):**  I got the same one pound of zinc, let's say,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:38):**  but now I got it distributed out here.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:40):**  So I got 50 of those in that square foot  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:42):**  and I've already got them hooked to a carbon.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:45):**  So my chances of having them just tied up and gone,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:48):**  I got better distribution to see now  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:50):**  when I grow my next crop,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:52):**  I wanna make sure some people say,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:53):**  well, I tested my next crop  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:55):**  and the level isn't any higher in my crop.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:58):**  Sometimes they forget the fact  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:59):**  that we've just increased their yield also.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:01):**  So pounds per acre removed might've gone up,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:03):**  but then in that next crop, see,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:05):**  now I got those minerals distributed in the stalks  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:09):**  and the residues and as this whole cycle  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:11):**  keeps going round and round,  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:12):**  I over time, I just keep building those numbers up,  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:14):**  cycling through carbon,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:16):**  there's all these levels of minerals have moved up also.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:19):**  If I'm gonna remove all those,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:20):**  and of course I'm gonna have some issues.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:22):**  So my whole thing about is these homogenized blends  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:26):**  have been something I've been working on for 30 years.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:29):**  And then it's about putting them in that base of carbon.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:31):**  And we also try to control the pH.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:33):**  We wanna make sure the pH is a little lower in that mix.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:35):**  So around each little bb,  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:37):**  we can keep those analysis higher  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:38):**  cause we're trying to get them exchangeable.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:41):**  Gary, this is a fascinating topic for me.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:44):**  And I'd like to get a little bit of context  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:48):**  and background to some of the work that we've done.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:50):**  So we started using SAP analysis  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:52):**  to measure the trace mineral absorption  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:54):**  and nutrient absorption of what crops are actually absorbing.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:57):**  So the SAP analysis, we measure 22 different parameters  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:01):**  and it is extremely sensitive and very accurate.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:04):**  It shows very quickly what's happening and what's going on.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:07):**  And when we put on an application  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:09):**  that the plants actually absorb,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:11):**  the needle moves very quickly.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:13):**  So about 2012 or 13, somewhere in there,  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:17):**  we're working in Southeastern Pennsylvania  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:20):**  where there's calcareous soils, limestone based soils  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:23):**  with pH of 7.2, 7.4, sometimes higher.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:27):**  And there's challenges with chronic manganese deficiencies.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:31):**  Historically, growers have been applying manganese sulfate  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:33):**  as a dry soil broadcast or even as a foliar spray.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:38):**  And we thought we were getting crop responses  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:40):**  when we're using tissue analysis,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:42):**  we would see the tissue analysis levels increase.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:45):**  When we started using SAP analysis,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:48):**  all of a sudden we realized that even the manganese sulfate  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:51):**  foliar sprays were not being absorbed effectively.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:53):**  They were still on the outside of the leaf,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:55):**  but they weren't actually being absorbed.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:57):**  As a result of that,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:58):**  several different growers that we've been working with  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:00):**  out there, we did experiments where they,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:04):**  we blended manganese sulfate in with humified compost  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:09):**  and we applied it at different plots of rates of 20 pounds,  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:15):**  40 pounds, 100 pounds, 200 and 400 pounds per acre  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:18):**  of manganese sulfate,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:20):**  the small plots on an experimental basis  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:21):**  to observe the plant response.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:24):**  How much do you think the manganese increased  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:26):**  on those small plots,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:28):**  even where we applied 400 pounds per acre?  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:31):**  I got to feel that one probably is greatly different  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:33):**  as one would think.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:36):**  Not a single point.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:39):**  There was no manganese absorption  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:42):**  from the applied manganese to the soil  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:44):**  when it was applied with compost.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:46):**  We measured plant absorption for three years  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:48):**  after the application and there was not on a single crop,  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:52):**  was there an actual crop response or plant absorption?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:55):**  And I have a couple of ideas of why that is  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:58):**  and why that was going on,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:00):**  but I'd like to ask you the question.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:03):**  Your carbon-based fertilizers and your homogenous blends,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:05):**  you mentioned a couple of different pieces  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:07):**  that I think are important.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:08):**  How are those different from what I described  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:10):**  and how are you able to get those plant responses?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:13):**  Right, so now you used a humified compost to put them in  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:17):**  and we tried to put them to a sponge  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:19):**  that would hold onto them.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:20):**  I think here's the whole thing.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:22):**  Let's go back to even the testing on trace minerals  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:25):**  and I think some of your comments that came through loud,  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:27):**  you're like, oh, you're feeding manganese  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:29):**  and doing a tissue test.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:30):**  Yes, it might come up because it's on the outside.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:32):**  You just put it there.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:33):**  It all got washed off.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:34):**  But my whole thing is this,  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:36):**  that every soil and every biology and every tillage  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:39):**  and every farm is kind of different  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:40):**  on how they see and perceive things.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:41):**  Your soil has a certain ability to dish out minerals.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:45):**  And so then if we dump down three, 400 pounds an acre,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:47):**  there's interactions and there's other things happening.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:49):**  So now you've got that mineral in the soil.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:52):**  It tied up with something and went somewhere,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:53):**  but did not necessarily go into the plant.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:56):**  Was that a good or a bad thing?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:57):**  Now, if we go to soil testing,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:59):**  manganese is one that I'm most critical of,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:01):**  but soil testing,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:02):**  these things are just giving us a little bit of clues  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:04):**  and maybe your SAP analysis is more accurate.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:07):**  My thing on the SAP analysis,  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:08):**  and I'll let you address it here,  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:10):**  is that you got to do it on a lot of basis  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:12):**  because the weather changes, the day changes,  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:13):**  the plant maturity changes, there's interactions  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:15):**  of how long ago I put my fertilizers on  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:18):**  and all these other things.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:19):**  But manganese is one of those minerals  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:21):**  that to me is a biological mineral.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:23):**  Because we're dairy people,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:24):**  we're constantly testing our feeds.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:25):**  Our feeds are more than double in manganese.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:27):**  So it's more than double in my feeds  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:30):**  than what average feed would have,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:32):**  like alfalfa for a dairy cow.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:34):**  And of course, years ago,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:35):**  I tell people that's why my father fed oats to cows.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:37):**  He didn't understand,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:38):**  but oats are a good source of manganese  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:40):**  because they're a fairly acidic plant  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:41):**  and they can take out manganese where others can't.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:43):**  So then that gets in that oats.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:45):**  So that manganese is double in our feeds,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:49):**  but my soil test, if I sent it in,  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:50):**  it says it's low in manganese.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:52):**  Now putting on more doesn't necessarily drive up more.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:54):**  So I tell people,  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:55):**  that's why you do have to really look at the plants  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:57):**  because we're testing a lot of feed for our cows.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:59):**  So manganese on the chemistry extraction from a soil  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:02):**  shows low and it might be not,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:04):**  maybe I don't have a big reserve out there.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:06):**  Now we'll add a small amount every year  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:08):**  because that gives more than what my soil can dish out.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:11):**  But because there's a biological link and really strong,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:14):**  I think on both phosphorus and manganese  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:16):**  and maybe some others,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:18):**  I got a huge uptake of manganese in the plant.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:20):**  So that's really what I'm after  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:22):**  because that's one of the signs to me.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:24):**  That's one way to measure good biological activity  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:27):**  is by watching manganese.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:28):**  I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:30):**  When you said that manganese is a biological mineral,  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:32):**  it's one of the things that we've observed  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:34):**  is that manganese and phosphorus and iron as well,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:37):**  cobalt, copper,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:38):**  the quantity that is absorbed by the plant  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:41):**  is in direct correlation to the level of biological  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:44):**  integrity and biological soil health.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:46):**  Biology trumps chemistry.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:48):**  You can have really screwed up chemistry in the soil  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:50):**  and as long as you have good biology,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:52):**  you can overcome that to some degree.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:53):**  But the opposite doesn't really be true.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:55):**  And that's why I think if you look at research out here now,  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:57):**  your little plots here using humified compost,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:00):**  which should have been some biological food and things,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:01):**  but what was the biological activity  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:04):**  and balance within those soils?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:05):**  And that's when you go to university research,  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:08):**  you've got to go to their farms and look around.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:10):**  If their soils are really dead and yours are not,  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:13):**  and you're a farmer and you're just down the road  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:15):**  and yours got a different biologic  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:16):**  and you're growing different varieties of crops  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:18):**  and cover crops and you're doing  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:19):**  some really positive things out there,  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:21):**  not using all these negative inhibitors  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:23):**  and pesticides that go on and on.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:24):**  The list goes just because they did the research  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:27):**  at their farm doesn't necessarily help you.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:31):**  That's very true.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:32):**  Gary, why use trace minerals?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:34):**  Why the emphasis on manganese and zinc and boron  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:38):**  and all these various trace minerals?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:39):**  What do they do for you from a crop quality  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:42):**  and health perspective?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:43):**  So I'll back up just a little bit  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:45):**  because we were talking about nitrogen.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:47):**  See when we added the sugars or the molasses  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:49):**  to the nitrogen, we were trading dollars.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:51):**  We took some of the nitrogen away  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:52):**  and we put some carbon with it.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:53):**  When we're taking our insecticides or our fungicides,  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:56):**  we trade dollars on nitrogen.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:57):**  We trade dollars on a phosphorus starter fertilizer.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:00):**  We take some of that out and we put our sugars in its place.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:02):**  When we go to add in these trace minerals  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:04):**  in today's world of economy, we just added a cost.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:07):**  They are not cheap.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:09):**  And if you go out to buy them, they're very expensive.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:10):**  So now to a farmer, I gotta live within their budget.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:13):**  So how do I shuffle dollars out of the farmer?  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:16):**  Or I'm gonna have to expect a huge increase in yield  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:19):**  when I think another really hard message  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:21):**  to get across to farmers is the fact that plant health  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:26):**  is really related to a balance of minerals  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:28):**  and trace minerals are huge for fungal diseases  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:31):**  and insect pressures.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:33):**  On our farm, we live right in an area,  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:35):**  we've never seen the need for an insecticide.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:37):**  There's a lot of corn dying from fungal disease out here.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:39):**  We see very little activity of that on our farm.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:42):**  So part of that is that excess nitrogen  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:44):**  you suck up in that plant.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:46):**  And I'm sure you've been a lot of time, probably more  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:48):**  than I have studying that looking at this DHism,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:50):**  what were the fungal diseases set up.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:52):**  The trace minerals are huge.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:53):**  And we've got a lot of evidence from farms.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:55):**  And we actually did some research  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:57):**  at the University of Wisconsin on corn  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:59):**  and we put our homogenized trace minerals on there  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:02):**  and just testing the trace minerals.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:03):**  Well, they put it on a field  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:05):**  where they didn't use any biotechnology  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:07):**  because they thought we didn't wanna use it, which we don't.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:09):**  But the corn was just diseased and brown.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:12):**  And we had a huge response from just a small amount  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:15):**  of trace minerals out of it  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:16):**  because we really stopped the diseases.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:18):**  So for a farmer, they've got to recognize that  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:21):**  as we get this, because of health and benefits and enzymes  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:24):**  and where do trace minerals fit in there?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:25):**  All those regulatory things within a plant  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:27):**  that actually promote health,  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:29):**  stimulate its immune system,  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:31):**  stimulate its ability to protect itself.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:33):**  I guess we'd wanna say so.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:35):**  When you start spending money on trace minerals,  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:37):**  you should be able to take the money away  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:39):**  from insecticides, fungicides, pesticides  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:40):**  and biotechnology to pay for it.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:42):**  But you can't say that to a farmer right up front  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:45):**  because he has to earn the right to do that.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:47):**  That should be his goal.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:48):**  I was at a huge Hutterite colony in South Dakota last week.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:52):**  They dropped all their insecticides.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:54):**  Now they're growing huge cover crops.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:55):**  They got livestock involved.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:57):**  They're doing better balanced fertility  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:58):**  and they've cut their nitrogen's way down.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:00):**  They've taken their soybean yields up by over 20 bushel  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:03):**  on just 20 inches of rain.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:05):**  One soybean plant with 508 pods on.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:07):**  It's unbelievable.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:08):**  Since their biology has really changed,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:10):**  they've dropped all their biotechnology  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:11):**  and they're slowly getting rid of all the chemistry.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:13):**  So all that money now I can make up by buying nutrition.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:17):**  I'm going to make my livestock and things better,  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:19):**  make my soils better in the future.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:20):**  So that's the hard one to be able to stay  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:23):**  within the farmer's budget with the day's economy.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:25):**  Cause that takes time and we just can't say,  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:28):**  look, drop all your biotechnology  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:30):**  and insecticides, fungicides  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:31):**  and put our trace for us on cause I don't know,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:32):**  maybe your experiences are different,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:34):**  but this doesn't always work 100% that way.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:37):**  I think that's one of the strengths  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:38):**  that we've observed with sap analysis is that,  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:40):**  yes, we do have to be on top of it and manage it.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:43):**  Like you have to manage a dairy ration.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:44):**  You have to measure constantly throughout the growing season  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:46):**  but you can actually be very accurate  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:48):**  and predict what's happening and what's going on.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:52):**  We have had successes quite consistently in the first year  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:56):**  when we started working with a grower.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:57):**  And we've done a lot of work in Southwest Kansas,  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:01):**  working with commodity crops, corn and soybeans  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:03):**  in these very hot, dry environments  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:05):**  with both irrigated and dry land corn.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:07):**  And one of the things that we've observed  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:09):**  with trace minerals,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:10):**  when growers begin applying trace minerals,  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:11):**  the great majority of the time,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:14):**  we cut out the miticide applications.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:16):**  Well, you're talking a miticide application  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:17):**  that costs $40 an acre and you apply it once or twice,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:20):**  all of a sudden you can afford trace minerals really easily.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:23):**  Yes.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:24):**  And I agree.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:25):**  Now we got to whether I put those trace minerals,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:27):**  we did a lot of work.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:28):**  I think that's done quite a bit over in Australia  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:30):**  where they put all these trace minerals  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:31):**  in their compost pile.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:32):**  They put a lot of minerals and things in their compost.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:34):**  Well, hopefully that can really work.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:36):**  There's all kinds of ways to do it.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:37):**  We also got to recognize that health and insect pressure  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:40):**  also gets a little bit out of repurposed diseases.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:43):**  Phosphorus uptake is huge.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:44):**  We got to get a high levels of phosphorus uptake.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:46):**  We got to make sure we got a nitrogen  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:48):**  and sulfur ratios in line.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:49):**  We got to make sure we got adequate levels of calcium uptake  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:52):**  and we got to have these ratios between those minerals.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:54):**  If you have really high potassium levels  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:56):**  and low magnesium, all those things stress a plant.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:59):**  So the trace minerals are a piece of it,  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:01):**  but there's more pieces to the puzzle.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:03):**  That's why this is a system  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:04):**  and we have to put that whole system in place.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:07):**  When you do your sap test and do this kind of thing,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:09):**  are you doing it at critical or certain stages  
**[0:43:12-0:43:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:12):**  throughout the season?  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:13):**  Is that your approach?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:15):**  Yes, we're doing it at critical stages.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:17):**  And if we're doing it for research to,  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:20):**  or in field research to try to get an understanding  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:23):**  of what is happening with that crop  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:24):**  throughout the entire season,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:25):**  we'll do it once every 14 days.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:27):**  And that can be incredibly revealing.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:30):**  You learn an awful lot about a crop and a soil system  
**[0:43:32-0:43:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:32):**  and how it's really functioning  
**[0:43:34-0:43:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:34):**  and how you can manage it better in the future.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:36):**  If you do that just for one year on one crop,  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:39):**  you'll learn a lot about  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:40):**  what's really happening on your farm.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:41):**  That makes perfect sense.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:42):**  And that to me, I think the farmers right now  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:45):**  are kind of down in the mouth and understandable  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:47):**  and kind of bummed out, how do I pay my bills?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:49):**  I think the fun and excitement in farming  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:52):**  is doing some of the things you're talking about  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:54):**  and some of the things I'm talking about here  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:55):**  is to get back and take charge of their farm.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:58):**  Otherwise I think they feel like  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:00):**  they're just kind of a slave to agribusiness out here  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:03):**  and they got all the fancy new stuff.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:04):**  But the fun in farming is getting this whole thing to work  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:07):**  and that's the part they kind of probably miss.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:10):**  So Gary, one of the conversations that we've been  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:13):**  kind of circling around all these pieces  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:14):**  when we spoke about nitrogen management  
**[0:44:16-0:44:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:16):**  and carbon and nitrogen and carbon-based fertilizers  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:20):**  is the importance of biology,  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:23):**  importance of having manganese and phosphorus  
**[0:44:26-0:44:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:26):**  delivered by biology.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:28):**  How do we regenerate soil microbial communities  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:31):**  after they've been severely compromised  
**[0:44:33-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:33):**  by challenging farm management practices, et cetera?  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:36):**  Yeah, and that was why I mentioned a little bit earlier,  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:39):**  she asked when we take on land,  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:40):**  we just took on some more land, the other 300 acres  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:43):**  and we're transitioning.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:44):**  I want to tell you, it was pretty dead.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:47):**  It was in pretty bad shape  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:48):**  and had not been fertilized very well,  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:50):**  been rented for numbers and numbers of years  
**[0:44:52-0:44:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:52):**  and everybody took whatever they could  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:53):**  with putting a little back they possibly could.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:55):**  So yes, we did revitalize.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:57):**  And maybe it's not capable of everybody to do this.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:00):**  First I'll say the organic guys,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:01):**  I think this is just such a beautiful  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:02):**  two year period of time.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:03):**  And everybody's, how can you afford to do that?  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:05):**  And I said, how can you afford not to do that  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:07):**  because they yield?  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:08):**  So we go out and take our soil tests  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:09):**  and we always start with calcium and phosphorus,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:11):**  drive our calcium and phosphorus levels,  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:13):**  make sure they're in line.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:14):**  And then we start doing these cover crops,  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:16):**  shallow incorporating them.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:17):**  And we just kept feeding the soil.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:19):**  Yes, I'd like to be able to put on compost  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:21):**  and yes, I'd love to have some livestock manure  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:23):**  if it's available.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:24):**  I do like my dairy manure.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:26):**  If you look in the world of biologicals,  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:27):**  a lot of our extracted from cattle punch material,  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:30):**  certain biologists and certain chemistries  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:32):**  because that's a pre-digestion going on,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:34):**  which you're not going to necessarily get  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:35):**  out of chicken manure or hog manure,  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:37):**  that old fermentation bat within a cow  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:39):**  and some other wonderful things, these digestate stuff  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:41):**  because we use a lot of manure coming out  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:43):**  of anaerobic digester on dairy farms  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:45):**  as our base for our fertilizers.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:47):**  So all these little things to regenerate that soil,  
**[0:45:51-0:45:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:51):**  would I go out there and spray a biology or a bug?  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:54):**  Ah, I haven't and I know there's a lot of people  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:58):**  selling bugs in the jug out here  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:00):**  and maybe they have their place  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:01):**  and maybe there's some special unique ones,  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:03):**  but me, I want to change that whole system.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:05):**  So organic, then I got those two years  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:07):**  and put everything back in the soil.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:08):**  So then when it is certified organic,  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:10):**  I hit a home run the first year.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:11):**  I mean, it just, we grow some seed corn out here  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:14):**  and we can get our 200 bushel corn that first year at $10.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:17):**  The bushel covers all my losses there in those two years.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:20):**  And you also got to recognize that 300 acres,  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:23):**  taking on 300 acres, we farm 1500.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:25):**  It's not a whole farm.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:26):**  We're not sacrificing a whole farm.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:28):**  Oh, that's a big cost, don't get me wrong.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:30):**  But next year that's organic.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:31):**  It's kind of all exciting because we get a high return  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:34):**  for a couple of years of high pay crops.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:36):**  We rent that land that we fix and the landlords,  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:39):**  the owners, they are just in shock at what we do.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:42):**  But I do get a seven year rent of two years to transition  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:44):**  and five years to farm it.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:46):**  We've never lost a piece of land yet that we've taken on  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:48):**  because they like what we do to it  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:50):**  and how we change that thing.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:51):**  So now let's go to a guy that corn beans,  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:54):**  corn beans and chemistry.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:57):**  It's a real struggle because of where the cover crops  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:59):**  even fit in.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:00):**  They have to be kind of committed.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:02):**  I maybe can bring on some compost or some livestock.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:05):**  I need to get so I don't have so much bare soil  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:08):**  and I'm more of a fibrous rich system.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:09):**  I need to get plants and food out there.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:11):**  Can I do that all with compost?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:13):**  I can make progress.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:15):**  But until I get, whether it be another crop  
**[0:47:17-0:47:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:17):**  or these guys down in Illinois,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:19):**  I see everybody's out of rye.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:21):**  The rye is all gone, the rye seeds.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:22):**  So more people are doing it.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:24):**  And rye is the only thing that you can plant late.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:26):**  It's not everybody's favorite thing.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:27):**  But how do I fit that in?  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:30):**  Us organic guys, the inner seed corn with the cover crop  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:33):**  really doesn't work very well because we plant later  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:37):**  and because we make a cultivation  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:39):**  when the corn is knee high.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:41):**  If I planted my corn earlier  
**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:43):**  and when it's six, eight inches tall,  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:44):**  now hopefully my chemical herbicides won't interfere with it  
**[0:47:47-0:47:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:47):**  I would then drill my cover crop in between the rows  
**[0:47:50-0:47:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:50):**  to get it established early May.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:53):**  Us organic guys, that would be mid June  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:54):**  and it's so hot and dry  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:56):**  but then the cover crops don't make it  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:57):**  and the corn's too big and it shades it out.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:59):**  I gotta be committed to have a diversity of plants  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:02):**  and something to recycle those nutrients  
**[0:48:04-0:48:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:04):**  and something for that biology to live on.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:06):**  Otherwise bugs in the jug, I was out in the coat  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:09):**  as these guys seem to be happy with $20 an acre  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:11):**  worth of bugs in the jug.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:12):**  I said, you're not gonna ever get away from this.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:15):**  This is an addiction that now you're spending $20 an acre  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:17):**  for the rest of your life  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:18):**  because you're not doing anything  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:20):**  to have them grow on their own.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:22):**  Yeah, our experience has been, we use microbial inoculants.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:25):**  We've seen a lot of successes with them  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:28):**  with one qualification, biology still needs a food source.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:31):**  And I think everything that you're talking about,  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:32):**  cover crops and developing this whole system  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:34):**  is all about developing the soluble carbon  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:37):**  in the soil profile they can use as a food source.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:39):**  The food source is the biggest limiting factor.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:41):**  It's not oxygen, it's not water, it's food.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:43):**  It's food.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:44):**  On a lot of farms.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:45):**  And I think that's the piece  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:46):**  that you're really talking about  
**[0:48:47-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:47):**  is adding microbial inoculants and bugs in the jug  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:51):**  and adding all these pieces, it's a temporary fix.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:54):**  You have to fix the entire system  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:56):**  so that that population desires to live there on its own.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:59):**  Yep, and you can make progress on a farm on soil health  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:03):**  just like right behind that combine  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:05):**  just spray on, like you said, a biological,  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:08):**  that's more of a fungal kind of  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:10):**  because you've got a complex carbon, old dead corn stalks  
**[0:49:12-0:49:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:12):**  and a little bit of nitrogen and some biology,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:14):**  a little bit sugar can really improve that digestion  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:16):**  and you can help to start improve your soils.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:18):**  But that's really just a small piece  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:20):**  because you still have one food source  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:22):**  that's complex carbon.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:23):**  So I don't have enough soluble carbon.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:25):**  Now, that's why, see Michigan State years ago  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:27):**  did research on interseeding that corn  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:30):**  and eight out of 10 or six out of 10 years  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:32):**  having that cover crop going in their corn  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:35):**  improve their yields of corn.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:36):**  And they were saying, how is that possible?  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:38):**  I said, because that thing is photosynthesizing  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:40):**  and putting its exudates down in the soil  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:42):**  to feed the biology.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:43):**  The biology feeds the plants.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:45):**  And so I can get those sugars  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:47):**  and maybe some of our humus has built out of those sugars.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:48):**  So you think, well, I'm robbing moisture  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:50):**  and I'm robbing nutrients, but you're giving back  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:52):**  because the plants give back a fair bit into the soil  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:55):**  to make this work.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:56):**  How else do I get these soluble carbohydrates  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:58):**  to work within my soil?  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:01):**  Which reminds me of something,  
**[0:50:03-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:03):**  I had some experiences recently that reminded me  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:05):**  of a Gary Zimmer quote that I heard many, many years ago.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:08):**  Something to the effect that we generally tend  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:12):**  to misdiagnose what is actually happening,  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:14):**  what's actually going on.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:15):**  Can you refresh my memory on what that quote was?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:19):**  Oh gosh, yes.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:21):**  50% of the time, I always say,  
**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:22):**  when we see and observe something,  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:24):**  we give the credit to the wrong thing  
**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:25):**  and we blame the wrong thing.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:27):**  50% of the time, I don't care who you are,  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:29):**  research your scientists.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:30):**  So you gotta always take that with a grain of salt  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:32):**  because your observation, they might have a,  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:33):**  it's got a chain reaction that took place  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:35):**  way long time before that.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:37):**  50% of the time, that's a really big,  
**[0:50:39-0:50:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:39):**  that's a big proportion of the time.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:40):**  That's a big proportion of the times.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:42):**  What I always want people to,  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:43):**  not to get hung up on one little piece of research,  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:46):**  I want them to focus on a system  
**[0:50:48-0:50:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:48):**  and all those things that can be taken  
**[0:50:49-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:49):**  with a grain of salt.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:50):**  And yes, there's tools out there today  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:51):**  and understandings we never had years ago.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:54):**  I said, my grandfather wasn't a biological farmer.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:56):**  He didn't understand.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:57):**  He was in battle with weeds.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:59):**  He didn't understand fertility and all these little,  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:01):**  he didn't understand why he plowed.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:03):**  And he was certainly,  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:05):**  he wasn't using a lot of harsh chemistries,  
**[0:51:06-0:51:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:06):**  but he was not necessarily doing all good things  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:08):**  for his soil either  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:09):**  because they were always in battle with something.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:11):**  Yeah, we've come a long ways.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:13):**  We've learned a lot of things the last couple of decades.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:16):**  And I was at a meeting in Illinois,  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:18):**  right down by Peoria, Illinois,  
**[0:51:19-0:51:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:19):**  in a heart of corn and bean ground, that $12,000 acre,  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:22):**  black soils that I don't know how they're going to pay  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:25):**  for my 10% interest when it gets there.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:26):**  But anyway, another story.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:28):**  And down those beautiful, rich black soils  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:31):**  at the meeting, there was at a farm  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:33):**  and it was kind of,  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:34):**  they were at least biological companies  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:37):**  selling their bugs in a jug.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:39):**  And not a single one,  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:40):**  they just wanted you to buy their bugs and spray them out.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:42):**  Not a single one was ever talking about a system.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:45):**  Because I had, you know, me on it,  
**[0:51:45-0:51:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:45):**  and I was joking and teasing around.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:47):**  And I said, all you guys,  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:48):**  if you're going to go buy those bugs in a jug,  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:50):**  maybe you ought to talk to us first  
**[0:51:51-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:51):**  and set the conditions up  
**[0:51:53-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:53):**  so they have a chance of making it.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:54):**  I can imagine Gary doing that very well,  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:58):**  because I remember, I recall Gary giving me  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:00):**  a hard time years ago.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:05):**  I would have done that job.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:06):**  I like to challenge people's thinking.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:09):**  And sometimes you gotta be rattled a little bit.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:12):**  And I've earned the right to do that.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:14):**  Cause see, I've been around a long time.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:17):**  Gary, what other topics are important for us to talk about?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:21):**  Well, I think we covered on this nitrogen thing,  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:23):**  which brought on a lot of this carbon-based fertilizer  
**[0:52:25-0:52:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:25):**  kind of a thing, and these sources of nutrients,  
**[0:52:28-0:52:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:28):**  and when and how we add them.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:30):**  And I tell people out here,  
**[0:52:32-0:52:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:32):**  we got this other movement going on in agriculture  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:34):**  that, you know, this regenerative thing  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:36):**  where they absolutely think that, you know,  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:39):**  you don't really need fertilizers.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:40):**  You got enough reserve in the soil,  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:43):**  you can pull them back out.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:44):**  And I think you and I both know  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:45):**  there's certain nutrients like salt,  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:46):**  for available calcium and boron  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:48):**  that might not work real well without ever adding them  
**[0:52:51-0:52:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:51):**  cause they're anions and they leach.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:53):**  But I think we get distorted views.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:56):**  Now that system I kind of find really interesting  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:58):**  cause they say you got a no-till  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:00):**  and you got to have livestock.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:01):**  Cause if you no-till and you got all these residues out here  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:04):**  that someone's got to break and digest them down  
**[0:53:06-0:53:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:06):**  so they graze them in the winter time.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:08):**  Well, they're in a place in the Nicodas  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:09):**  where they get 20 inches of rain.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:11):**  Now let's go where you get 40 inches of rain.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:13):**  There's a neighbor of ours that started to graze cattle.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:15):**  We had this 10 inches of rain two weeks ago.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:17):**  He never took them off the pastures.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:19):**  How long do you think this is going to work?  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:21):**  So we always got these different systems out here.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:23):**  And so I think some of the topics we covered  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:25):**  is how this management fits in it  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:27):**  and how they got to treat that soil  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:28):**  as this living live entity and make sure that,  
**[0:53:30-0:53:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:30):**  would you leave your cows out on a pasture  
**[0:53:33-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:33):**  for several days when it just rained 10 inches?  
**[0:53:35-0:53:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:35):**  Or would you lock them up off that field  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:37):**  and give that chance back?  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:38):**  They've destroyed that field for a long time, in my opinion.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:41):**  So that management part of it,  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:43):**  they got to really understand us and say,  
**[0:53:44-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:44):**  how do they put this management end together on that farm?  
**[0:53:47-0:53:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:47):**  And they got to be able to understand where they're going.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:50):**  I think it's like I said,  
**[0:53:51-0:53:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:51):**  they just automatically think that diseases show up.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:54):**  Oh, the population of bugs in the county  
**[0:53:56-0:53:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:56):**  are really high this week.  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:57):**  I was over in England at a conference  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:59):**  and they developed a meter  
**[0:54:01-0:54:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:01):**  that you can put on the corner of your farm.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:03):**  And when the spore levels get so high  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:05):**  on certain fungal disease,  
**[0:54:06-0:54:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:06):**  they want you to go out and spray.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:08):**  And now, I'm at the conference, I just couldn't keep quiet.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:12):**  I stood up and said,  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:12):**  I just came over on a plane.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:14):**  If one of those sat in the corner of the plane,  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:16):**  I'm pretty sure I'd be on antibiotics today.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:18):**  And yet I have an immune system  
**[0:54:19-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:19):**  and I don't take antibiotics unless I absolutely need to.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:22):**  And I'm not sick today.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:23):**  And so everybody laughed kind of,  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:24):**  because it just seems like,  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:26):**  how do we get them to understand  
**[0:54:28-0:54:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:28):**  that this system was designed to work  
**[0:54:30-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:30):**  and when everything is in its little place,  
**[0:54:31-0:54:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:31):**  we should have healthy, high producing crops  
**[0:54:33-0:54:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:33):**  without having to spend all our money  
**[0:54:35-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:35):**  on plant protective things that never make my farm better.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:37):**  And they have terrible side effects.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:39):**  How do we get that little discussion  
**[0:54:41-0:54:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:41):**  is the one that there's a certain topics  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:43):**  that are really hard to get through people's head.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:44):**  Like we talked about nitrogen numbers and credits,  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:46):**  understanding that health is something you can achieve  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:49):**  without putting an insecticide or a fungus on  
**[0:54:51-0:54:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:51):**  just because spores are in the area, doesn't need to use it.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:52):**  There's certain things they gotta believe and understand.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:55):**  And yet there'll be bumps and obstacles in the road  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:58):**  and they can use those tools if needed,  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:00):**  but they don't have to depend upon them.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:01):**  I think what's exciting about agriculture  
**[0:55:03-0:55:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:03):**  is there's so much pressure being put on  
**[0:55:05-0:55:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:05):**  the chemistry companies,  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:06):**  whether it's Bayer or Monsanto or whoever it is,  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:09):**  all these different companies  
**[0:55:10-0:55:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:10):**  that are coming out with huge amount of more safer  
**[0:55:14-0:55:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:14):**  control agents, whether it be for fungal diseases  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:16):**  or for insects or whether they be for whatever.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:19):**  I think they're coming out with safer kind of things  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:22):**  to be able to handle and put on our land.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:23):**  Now, herbicides are a really big battle out here.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:26):**  People are having much, much stronger, harsher herbicides.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:29):**  Those weeds wanna survive on this planet also,  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:31):**  and they're gonna come back against us no matter what we do.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:34):**  So we better learn how to live with them in a system.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:37):**  Mother nature always bats last and she always wins.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:40):**  I know, isn't that terrible?  
**[0:55:44-0:55:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:44):**  Or not.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:45):**  It's always designed to get rid of the sick  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:47):**  and the undesirable too.

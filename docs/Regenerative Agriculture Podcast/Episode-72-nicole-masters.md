### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Fri, 25 Jun 2021 18:27:46)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture podcast.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  Welcome back.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:06):**  On this podcast, we talk about agronomic science and the cultural management practices that  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:11):**  regenerate plant health and soil health, that regenerate ecological health, and ultimately  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:16):**  that regenerate animal and public health, of course, as well, because those are all  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  pieces that we care about and that are all important.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  My guest today is someone that I've been wanting to speak with for quite some time.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  I grew up, spent a lot of her time and career on the other side of the planet, Nicole Masters  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  from New Zealand.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  Welcome, Nicole.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  I'm really honored to have you here.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:35):**  Thank you for being here.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  Thanks for having me, John.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  I'm really excited to be here with you.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  Nicole, I've really enjoyed reading your book, For the Love of Soil, and I really like the  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:47):**  title as well.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  Because I think all of us would do well to have more empathy and more appreciation for  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  soil and for the landscape and everything that is within that landscape because the  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  degree that we have empathy, of course, is the degree that we are able to affect change  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  and to influence change.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  I'd love to learn a bit more about the things that you're working on and have you share  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:13):**  some of those with our audience.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  But before we go into some of those, can you tell us a little bit about your story and  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  the context?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:21):**  What brought you to this work today?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  What are some of the memorable moments on your pathway?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  Great.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:26):**  Thanks, John.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  Yeah, it's always such a big question.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  You go, wow, which bit do you pick from?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  And I was having a conversation with my grandmother recently, and she revealed that my great-grandfather  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:37):**  was one of New Zealand's first extension agents.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:41):**  It blew my mind because I'm like, am I genetically programmed to want to be involved in agriculture  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  and have some genetic threads around education?  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  It just blew my mind how maybe sometimes I don't have as much free will as I think I  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:57):**  do.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  The epigenetics and memory transfer are very powerful things that we do not appreciate  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  fully.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  It does.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  It boggles my mind.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:05):**  And I often think about it in terms of, as New Zealanders, we really came from some pretty  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:10):**  tough stock of people that were travelers and traveled across the seas to one of the  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  last places that was discovered.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:17):**  And so these people were tough.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:19):**  And so, yeah, I feel like I've come from tough blood that are also travelers.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  So most of my life has been traveling.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  My father was a pilot.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:27):**  We never lived in a place for longer than two years.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  So we lived in the North Island and the South Island and in Hong Kong, of all places.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  And all of that had a really formative impact on me in terms of seeing land from above,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:43):**  so looking down from aircraft and just being really impacted by, in New Zealand especially,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  like the amount of erosion.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  And so from five years of age, my parents remember me pointing out erosion and being  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:53):**  really worried about where was the soil going, which maybe I'm a weird kid.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  I don't know.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  But living in Hong Kong, the thing that I saw was like people will live in smog that  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  was covering all the vehicles.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  Everything's covered in this black stuff that you could wipe off.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  And if I get into the bottom of a car parking building that's full of carbon monoxide,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  I always feel nostalgic because that's what Hong Kong smells like.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  And there's like all these plastic bags and garbage.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  And I just remember thinking, wow, people will live in their own filth and it doesn't  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  create behavior change.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:27):**  Like what is it that actually will lead people to change?  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  And so part of it became a real driver for me in terms of I need to speak my truth and  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  be willing to speak up because if we don't speak up, nothing's going to change.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  We're just going to go off the rails.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  So when I was 25, my dad actually bought a property and said, yeah, let's do this together.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  He left lying and I left university.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  And I think it was that, what do they say, green on green makes black and blue.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  It was a little bit like that with both of us not understanding much about working with  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  landscapes.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  But we restored a wetland and we planted 700 avocado trees, ran a galphy, bull stud.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  And it was a very deep dive.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  And at the time, well, I think it's still true now.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  I was a single parent and it is really hard to find work in rural communities.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  And my dad actually helped me out by setting me up with a worm farm business.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  So I brought a deceased worm farm estate and got into vermiculture.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  I had a background in soil science.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  That's what I'd studied at university.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  And no one had mentioned that the darn stuff is alive.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  And then I went to a session with Elaine Ingham and she just talked about soil being alive.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  And I'm like, nobody mentioned this and it's such a critical part.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  So I started to make a vermicast product specifically for strawberry producers, for pastoral producers  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:52):**  and for avocados.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  And so catered that biologically for what we were doing and saw some incredible results.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  So it just seems like a journey that we never stopped learning and it never stops evolving.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  And because I'm not afraid of traveling, here I am right now, I'm in my horse trailer in  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:08):**  South Dakota working with the Intertribal Agriculture Council.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  Yeah, I'm just always in different places living with ranchers and farmers and living  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:17):**  in people's worlds and I love it.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  So you've certainly gotten to observe and experience agriculture in many different ecosystems  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  and many different types of environments and both to see what the challenges and where  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  the opportunities are, which are often opposite sides of the same coin, aren't they?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:34):**  I'm really intrigued by your mention of producing vermicompost for specific applications because  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:40):**  this is something that is perhaps not appreciated is how you can really customize microbial  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:45):**  applications to produce a specific outcome.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  Can you tell us a little bit about that?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  What were the things that you were doing to try to produce specific changes for a given  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  crop?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  So if you think about vermicast or you think about feeding worms, worms will eat pretty  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  much anything that's lived before, any kind of organic matter.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:04):**  And they are happy just eating manure or just eating vegetable scraps.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  You meet people and you've got like little worm farms in their houses and they stink  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  and they make all this liquid and they're just feeding vegetable scraps.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  And that makes a very, very, very bacteria dominated vermicast.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  And one thing you can do is you can actually take some vermicast or compost, put it in  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:28):**  a seedling tray and then just leave it outside and then observe what is it that grows.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  So that germination signal is determined by microbiology, as you know.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  And so what will signal will either be, hey, here's a whole lot of broadleaf weeds or here's  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  a whole lot of things like kosher or nettles, your nitrate weeds, or actually here's soft  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  perennial grasses.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:52):**  So it's a really interesting observation as to if you are buying compost is just leave  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:57):**  it outside and see what grows.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  And if it just grows a whole of those annual or nitrate loving weeds, I wouldn't be using  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  that in my garden or certainly not in agricultural context.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  It's quite interesting.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  So we did get into larger scale composting and we had a sitler turner.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  What I found is as I've got older, maybe I've got lazier, but by the time I left my farm,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:21):**  like I sold it seven years ago and I've been on the road for seven years, is we were just  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  making vermicast basically from wood chips, white wood chip species.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  So willow, poplar, and over here it might be cottonwood, aspen, species like that.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  So fast growing soft white woods.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  And we would put in maybe a little bit of manure, maybe a bit of fish hydrolizate into  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  that blend.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:44):**  And then at the start of when, so we'd get like 200 cubic meters or 200 cubic yards of  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  wood chips, and then we would actually leave the pigs on it.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  So feeding pigs on wood chips and it's amazing how many wood chips they'll actually eat.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:58):**  But then when you take the pigs off and the worms come in and we just leave it to mature  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:02):**  and it's really that maturation that really brings that fungal diversity out and the,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  you know, the saprophytic fungi just go nuts.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  So the ones that are breaking down that complex wood chip.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:12):**  So by the time it's finished, you know, you can still see that there's some wood chip  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:16):**  in there, but it's the most beautiful vermicast and the smell and it's amazing.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  And when you look at underneath the microscope, it's absolutely a 10 out of 10 in terms of  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  beneficial nematodes and all your protozoa and everything.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  And so really it was from being really lazy that I could make a great fungal product,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  which you know, things like in horticultural situations, you know, you've picked fruit  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  industry, certainly avocados and strawberries is where we're pushing for a very, very fungal  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  dominant type blend.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:47):**  What I found was if we were doing stuff for vegetable production, then that could be the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  vermicast that we harvest earlier.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:53):**  We were using, I say we, it was me.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  I was using a lot of pig manure, so using pig manure as part of that food material for  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:00):**  worms.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  So still mixing it with some cardboard and wood chips and maybe, you know, putting a  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  little bit of guano or whatever it was that vermicast, I don't know, it was a lot of intuition  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  actually John that I think about it.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  And then that product, if you harvested early on, would be really good for vegetables.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:15):**  So I was looking at it under the microscope as I was going and I had indoor beds and outdoor  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  beds and I actually found that they produce different types of microbial diversity.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  So then I could choose which beds to use for which type of crop.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:30):**  I think it's interesting as we're learning more about bacterial and fungal dominated  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  crops and how we can influence plant nutrition of those different crops.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:37):**  But of course, one of the challenges, the reason I asked the question about vermicompost  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  production is one of the challenges that we have is actually producing materials that  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  move the soil in one direction or another.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  Or particularly in the fungal direction.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  Like it's, we can, there are dozens of effective bacterial inoculants available in the marketplace,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  but when you want to talk about establishing fungal populations, for the most part, those  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  are materials that you have to produce on your own in some way, shape or form by vermicompost  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  or by the Johnson-Sue bioreactors or some form of composting that will lead you in that  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  direction.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  So true.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  And what's kind of interesting is that, so mycorrhizae obviously aren't going to grow  
**[0:10:17-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  in vermicast or compost, but what we found was by that, and I guess it's the quorum signals,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  those metabolites that we're putting on when we're putting in these vermicasts, is that  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  we saw massive increases in the colonisation of mycorrhizae, even though there's no mycorrhizae  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  in it, it's that signal to germinate that the mycorrhizae was receiving from either  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  the biopriming of seeds or putting materials down with the seed.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:45):**  So we're doing some really cool stuff here in Montana on rangeland by putting small amounts  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  of vermicast down the drill.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  And what we're seeing is the germination of species that we're not planting, the perennial  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  grasses that are responding to that signal.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:59):**  So let's talk a little bit about this because I've been studying quorum sensing and quorum  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  signaling for quite some time, but I haven't yet talked about it here on the podcast because  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  I feel like there's always more to learn before I dig into that a little bit more.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:15):**  So what's happening with quorum sensing?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  First of all, what is quorum sensing or, and also quorum signaling?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:21):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:23):**  And it's so interesting, John, that I hadn't realised you haven't covered this topic.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  I mean, if you look in the literature, in the last three years, this space is just blowing  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:31):**  up and it's so fascinating because it's something that has been done by indigenous  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  people for a long time and you look at like natural Korean farming, it's all on this basis  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  of these quorum signals.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  So if you think of a cell, like just any kind of bacterial cell, on the outside of that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  cell wall is a hundred thousand receptors.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  And those receptors are waiting for some kind of signal because they can't see, they can't  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  hear.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  And so those signals they're receiving could be electromagnetic, it could be temperature,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  and it could be some of these chemical byproducts.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  So the secondary metabolites and the different types of signals that either biology releasing,  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  so there's different types of signals that the microbe will say, well, are you my friend  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:14):**  or are you about to eat me?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  So they can recognise each other and there are organisms that will actually send signals  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:21):**  to try and pretend to be a different type of organism so they can blend in or they can  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  signal to each other to hunt.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  So they saw this really cool example of this where a bunch of protozoa actually hunted  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:33):**  down a nematode like wolves chasing down its quarry and it's all based on these signals.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  So quorum sensing literally means that you have enough organisms to form a quorum of  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:45):**  agreement.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  So we have enough organisms and they get to a certain critical moment and now they switch  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  on that gene expression in that organism.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  So that might be for bioluminescence or it might be for biofilms or it might be for virulence.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  So you might have these organisms in your body and you're not sick and then they reach  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:03):**  a critical threshold, they send a signal, now they go virulent, they start to produce  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  very quickly and now you're sick.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:10):**  So they've developed one for cholera that you can actually drink the chemical signal  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  to turn cholera off and it's parts per trillion that we're talking about.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  So these signals are very, very, very small amounts of these signals and it'll signal  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  to the cholera that basically there's too many other cholera here, you should just leave  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  and then it will actually flush out of the body.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  So we're seeing breakthroughs in this in terms of medical science because it could actually  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:34):**  replace antibiotics.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  We could be very specific.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  Now what's interesting about the cholera signal is it was the same signal to turn off  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  botrytis in a plant.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:44):**  So there's massive capacity out there to be thinking how subtle can I be, how little does  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  it need for a system to change?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:52):**  And we've seen some stuff we've never been able to explain until now and we're seeing  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:56):**  it coming through in the literature.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  Why is it so important to have a seed microbiome?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  Why is it so important to have that microbiology right at the start?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:05):**  And then what are these signals to turn something on or turn something off?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:10):**  So that's what these different metabolites are for.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  And so the plant's doing it all the time.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:14):**  It's signaling to say, hey, I'm under attack, you know, I'm going to signal to some type  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  of biology.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  And if that biology is there to respond, then it induces obviously all your induced systemic  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:24):**  responses and all the other things happen in terms of plant defense.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:28):**  But if that plant signals and there's no microbe there to respond, that defense mechanism doesn't  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:34):**  kick in.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  And now what's really interesting, and we're seeing this with breeding, is that there are  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:39):**  plants now that no longer have the ability to signal.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:42):**  So there's wheat that can no longer signal to protozoa or there's wheat that will no  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:46):**  longer signal to mycorrhizae.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  So we've corrupted this system by selecting for specific cultivars.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  And I'm sure you know a lot more about that than I.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  But I mean, I just I get so excited about it because we're seeing like phenomenal stuff.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:02):**  I just had someone yesterday ring me up and they were so excited because for decades they've  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  just grown dandelion.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  And we talked to them last year about doing something different.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  And this year she was like, the dandelion's totally gone.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:12):**  And it's just it's so hard to explain it until you get into these mechanisms of what are  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  these signals?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  What is it that we're putting down that's changing?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:22):**  Especially with annuals, how quickly we can change it.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  And what I'm seeing is when we're putting stuff down the drill and cropping is they  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  might do a pre-emergent spray, but they're no longer requiring a post-emergent spray  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  because those signals are basically setting the scene in that soil and they're not signaling  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:39):**  to the primitive weeds to germinate.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  There's a couple of different aspects here that are worth unwrapping a little bit.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  I find this entire topic really intriguing because one of my mentors who passed away  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:52):**  a number of years ago was Bruce Tainio.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  And he was a leading microbiologist here in North America.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  And he spoke all the time about quorum sensing.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:01):**  And I didn't hear anyone talk about it for 15 years.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  And now we're having this conversation again, which I find really enjoyable.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  So there's kind of two aspects in my understanding.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:13):**  One of them is I like to separate out quorum sensing versus quorum signaling.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:18):**  So quorum sensing is, as you described, when you have a large enough group of organisms  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:25):**  that they change their behavior and they begin behaving as, for lack of a better term, they  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:31):**  begin behaving as a single organism rather than as a group of individuals.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  Then of course, there's also the signaling aspect of how that group or how those individuals  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  both perceive signals and respond to those signals.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:43):**  So you've been talking about germination of different crops and in signaling for defense  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  mechanisms and weed seed development.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  But it's really interesting how we all know that we can have a large bank of a certain  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  weed seed in a given soil profile, but it doesn't germinate.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  And there's never been particularly good explanations for that.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  There've been some people who've talked about, described the nutritional profile, say when  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  you have a certain nutritional profile that influences the weed profile.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:16):**  But we all know that there's more to the story than that.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:19):**  So I know you spoke about that a little bit, but can you give us some examples of specific  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  case studies of what you have done to produce different weed populations?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  It's probably the thing I'm most fascinated about in terms of the soil is because it's  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:33):**  so obvious above ground.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  And I often think of it like being someone's fingerprints.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  You can kind of see what someone's been doing across the landscape by the different types  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  of plant communities that are growing.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  And so if we think about weeds, and whatever a weed is, a weed to you might be forage to  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  somebody else, but thinking about these plants as indicator species.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  And so there's more than just a nutritional element involved because it could be something  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  like we have bare soil, right?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  That's going to create some plants to germinate.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  Could be a light response as well.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  Could be low organic matter is going to cause a response.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  It could be the microbial communities or imbalances, a mineral community or imbalances, and then  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  a toxin release.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  And so one of the ones I found really interesting was seeing milk thistle, and it was in a gully.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  You guys say gullies, coolies, gulch, I don't know.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:28):**  And it was only this one place on this whole farm where all this milk thistle was growing.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  And I said to the farmer, what's under the ground there?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:35):**  Why?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  You know, that's interesting.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  So it's an old dump and we have a whole lot of batteries in there.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:40):**  So the batteries had been leaking and this milk thistle had responded to it.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  And then the second time I saw milk thistle, I was on the San Andreas fault line.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  And all along that fault line, as far as you could see, was milk thistle.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:53):**  And I'm like, that's fascinating.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  I wonder what's happening.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:56):**  And then of all the things, I sat on a plane next to a woman who was a nuclear scientist.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  And she started to tell me about how, you know, deep down in the ground, when you get  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  the plates moving, they grind and there's uranium down there and what's released is  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:09):**  radon gas.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  And then it got me thinking, well, milk thistle, we use that in the human body as a liver detox.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  I wonder if it's detoxing these soils.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  And sure enough, when we've tested in soils now, we were seeing these heavy dense populations  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:23):**  of milk thistle, there'll be some kind of contaminant.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  Because we saw this blow up as well after the Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  we saw milk thistle just turning up everywhere.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  So for me, it's the patterns of what is it that this particular plant might be doing.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  We know that some are really good at pulling radiation out of the ground.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  You know, sunflower has been used to do that.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  Even like marijuana and hemp, you know, they have the ability to phytoremediate heavy metals  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  and different types of toxins.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  So observing where do we see these things grow naturally.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  And what we see is how when we do have major mineral imbalances, we have what we call the  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  dynamic accumulators.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  And these weeds will specifically be making nutrients available that are low in the soil,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:05):**  but making them high in the plant.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  And then they will actually exude some of those minerals in a bioavailable form back  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:10):**  out their root system.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  So not only in their leaves, but also in their roots, and then they're making that available  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  to the next plant community.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  So they're actually shifting soils to become more advanced, if you're willing to sit there  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:22):**  for 100 years and wait for them to do this shifting.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:25):**  So we did some pretty extraordinary stuff by measuring or doing leaf tissue testing  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  of that specific weed and saying, what is it that this weed is trying to tell me?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  What is it high in?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  What is it trying to balance out?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  And the only time we find, the only exception to that rule would be sodium or nitrates.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:43):**  So a plant that where soil is high in sodium or nitrates, we might find high sodium and  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  nitrates in that.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  But otherwise we find mostly low soils, you'll find these nutrients high in the plant.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:54):**  So I don't know if you've come across Betsy Ross down at Sustainable Growth Solutions  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:58):**  in Texas.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  She's absolutely incredible, but she does the same practice as I do.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:03):**  And what she was doing was measuring mesquite and found that mesquite was very high in some  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  trace elements, including copper.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:10):**  And I can't remember what the other ones were, but she basically made like a nutritional  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  profile based on what the mesquite was high in.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  And then she brewed that with a fulvic acid and some other materials, then sprayed that  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:21):**  back onto the mesquite.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  And within a couple of weeks, all that mesquite Cambrian growth, the bark cracked open.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  And so you can go where she's done these spraying and all of these mesquite trees are dead.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  So by looking at what is it that this plant's actually trying to address, you know, is it  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  a microbial or a mineral, then it actually gives us a whole new access to can we shift  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:41):**  the soil so that it no longer suits that plant.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  Looks like magic basically.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:46):**  This brings several pieces to mind.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  One of them is the story of giant ragweed.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:51):**  So when you speak about bioremediation from milk thistle and also from marijuana and hemp,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  I perceive that there is a similar bioremediation effect from giant ragweed.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:00):**  And I look at the way that the behavior of giant ragweed has changed over the years.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  I suppose the simple way to say it is that giant ragweed went from being an aggressive  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:10):**  weed that grew several feet tall to a superweed that would germinate at all times of the year,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  all the way up into September or into the fall and seed in a matter of 30 to 40 days  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  after germination and into a plant that would grow three or four meters tall in all the  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  environments that had chronic systemic pesticide applications.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  Across the Midwest.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:39):**  The worse the pesticide applications became, the crazier the giant ragweed went.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:43):**  Totally.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  So there's a parallel correlation if you look at the timeline, you look at the history.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  Fifty years ago, giant ragweed was a relatively benign plant compared to what it is today.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  And I think kosher as well.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:57):**  So you can measure kosher and see the same thing.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  And there's another element to it too, which I guess comes down to herbicide resistance,  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  which is still part of what we're talking about in terms of gene expression.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  And so we think about how glyphosate operates on the shikimate pathway.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  These herbicide resistant weeds have the ability to have an overrunning of that shikimate pathway.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  So it's just spinning like a treadmill.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  And so the herbicide can't work on that because it's spinning so hard.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:27):**  And what they found is it's aromatic amino acids that shut that spinning down.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:32):**  And so people that are really looking at nutrition and they are maybe buffering the herbicides  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  that they're using or they're using products that are these amino acids, which I'm sure  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  that you are using, shuts that over expression of that gene down.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  So there's so many different angles, I guess, to this weed thing that I just find so fascinating.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  The next piece that I'd like to dig into following up on these healing herbs, which we sometimes  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  call weeds, is what are the practices that you have observed?  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  What are the tools or practices that people can use to shift what is going on in an environment?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  Yeah, I guess it depends if we're talking cropping or viticulture or if we're livestock  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  operations.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  Just think everything that we do is a signal.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:23):**  It's either pushing for more disturbance or less disturbance.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:26):**  What is our timing?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:27):**  So thinking if you're in a grazing operation, you're grazing, trampling manure, urine early  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:34):**  in the season is actually a different signal than that grazing and trampling late in the  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  season, depending on what we're trampling or what we're feeding.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  I mean, I do think cover crops are an extraordinary jumpstart for people that are looking to kind  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  of start.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  You know, what are some of the things that will reboot a system?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  That really is just getting diversity out there, especially if we've been in a monocultural  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  environment for a while or asking the question when we're in horticulture of where would  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  this plant grow in nature and what would be its companion species?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:04):**  We saw some interesting stuff in apple production where using high fungal compost and humic  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  acids is suddenly wild strawberries started to grow everywhere.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:16):**  The guy was kind of worried.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:17):**  He's like, where are all these wild strawberries coming from?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  Maybe it's the neighbors who was a strawberry producer.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  And I'm like, well, no, these are different species.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  They were only responding where he applied the humic acid.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  So where the humic acid had gone, you could see the line and that's where these plants  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:31):**  were germinating.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  And you know, strawberries, wild strawberries are a natural companion to apple trees.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  So thinking, you know, if we got clover in there, have we got low growing perennial species  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  instead of these tall grasses or these weedier species?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  I lost the beginning of your question.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:49):**  I'll reframe a little bit.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  You mentioned how application of vermicompost in a drill has caused different plants to  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:00):**  begin germinating.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  So my question would be, what are tools or practices that farmers can use to kind of  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  jumpstart and shift the microbial population in a different direction?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  Yeah, I do think that's one of our best tools is if we are seeding or even if people are  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:18):**  using any kind of mechanical interventions is to set your system up so that you can drip  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:23):**  some of these microbial down.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  And if that's a Johnson Sue, if it's some of the Korean natural composting, if it's  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  vermicast, it doesn't take a lot of material.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  Like we're typically using about two pounds an acre of vermicast in rangeland and we're  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:38):**  putting that down.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:40):**  So we might be actually spraying that as a liquid or a liquid slurry, or we're putting  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  that down directly with the seed.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:47):**  And then what that does is, especially if you can coat the seed first, that's going  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:51):**  to give that seed a competitive advantage because a lot of people are concerned obviously  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:55):**  about sowing into existing pasture.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:57):**  But that bio-priming, so that's that coating of that seed with some of these diverse extracts  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:03):**  really sets that plant up for success and it buffers it against any issues around, let's  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  say aluminum, see my good American pronunciations, aluminum or sodium.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:15):**  It's not aluminum?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  Come on.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  I try.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  I'm not sure what I'm saying if I say that or changes in pH or anything that's really  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:23):**  going to affect that plant's success in germination is we can get these extracts down at very  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  low rates.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  And then what it's also doing is waking up a dormant seed bank.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  So I think Diane Ian Haggerty in Western Australia, many of your listeners have probably heard  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  of them, just the most extraordinary cropping operation over in WA.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  What we saw one year when I was there was after they'd harvested their crops, they had  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  a light summer rainfall, just a little bit of rain came through and what germinated where  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  that crop had come off down the rows.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  So only down the rows was this serratia grass species that has been locally extinct for  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  like 60 years and it only germinated where that worm extract had gone down the drill.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  It just looks like someone's sowing this native grass.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  It's just absolutely amazing.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:12):**  And so that's given them summer forage now because they allowed that to go to seed, they're  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  increasing that seed bank.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:18):**  But that seed was just responding to that signal that it was getting from this worm  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  extract.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  And so we're seeing the same thing here in Montana is we're just seeing perennial grass  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  species that haven't been seen and certainly not in high numbers suddenly turning up and  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:34):**  increasing, which is really exciting.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:36):**  There's so many different dots to connect in this conversation that my thoughts go in  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  half a dozen different directions at once.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  About wheat losing its capacity to signal soil biology.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  And of course, I'd like to talk a little bit about the function of biology in responding  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  to plant signals to actually enhance plants immune system and to give them disease resistance.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:01):**  Because I think this is a piece that is not widely known is that when we talk about plant  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:07):**  immune systems and the systemic acquired resistance pathway and the ISR pathway, both pathways  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  can be triggered by biology in the root system that are responding to signals by the plant.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:21):**  So there's that aspect that comes to mind.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  And then there's also the aspect of when we talk about quorum sensing, James White in  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  the conversation that I had with him here on the podcast talked about how organisms  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  that we label as pathogens can actually shift their behavior and begin behaving as beneficials  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:41):**  and have a positive relationship, a beneficial relationship with a plant.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  And ultimately what we're talking about is similar to the example that you shared of  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  cholera or an organism producing an infection in our body.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  It's when you reach this critical threshold.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  And so what changes when you have a critical threshold of beneficial organisms versus a  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  critical threshold of potential pathogens, you have signaling happening between these  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:11):**  two groups behaving as an entire organism.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:14):**  I want to hear your take on all those.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  I put a lot out there fairly quickly.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:19):**  You did indeed.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  I think one example might be trichoderma.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  So if you think of trichoderma can be a plant pathogen, it can actually invade into plant  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  roots.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:33):**  But what we find is in symbiosis with mycorrhizae, they both benefit each other.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  So trichoderma is a fungus that eats fungi basically, but together and together with  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  Pseudomonas as well, that we see this cascading positive effect by introducing them to the  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  plant if you are doing some kind of seed treatment with those organisms.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  But that valuable role in trichoderma in terms of if that plant is under attack, it will  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  signal to trichoderma and trichoderma will respond back to the plant with different types  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  of chemical metabolites that then induce things like jasmonic acids or proteinases, depending  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  on what the plant is under attack from, that don't happen without trichoderma.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:16):**  And I remember years ago, maybe in 2006, I saw this photograph and it was a brassica  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  that had all of this white hyphae around its root systems.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  And the farmer told me that he had sold it with Pseudomonas and mycorrhizae and it had  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  mycorrhizal colonisation.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:35):**  And I went, well, no way, man, that's not true.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:39):**  And in the literature, it wasn't true at the time.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  There's no evidence for that.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:43):**  Brassicas are non-mycorrhizal, they won't form this relationship.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  Well, sure enough, I've had to eat some humble pie in the last few years because the research  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:50):**  is showing that actually with the presence of trichoderma and Pseudomonas, mycorrhizal  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  colonisations can happen in non-host plants and it will benefit, which I just think that's  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  just...  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  We experienced that a decade ago as well to say, well, the literature must be wrong because  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  it's happening.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  It's happening, that's right.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  And to listen to people when they say that.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  But I think this space is moving so quickly that if we're dogmatic and think we have the  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  total answers to any of this, we're dreaming, but I think that essential role of microbiology  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:22):**  in plant defence has been probably undervalued and is now what we're really seeing showing  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  up.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:28):**  And we can't predict what species is going to be needed in these relationships because  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  we still don't really know.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  So that's where I think the biodiverse compost, the biodiverse cover crops in terms of cover  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:43):**  crops are feeding different types of microbial communities.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  It's having all of this diversity in there is what's going to build resilience and what's  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  going to build immune function for your following crop.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  And there's some cool stuff that happens with weeds as well in terms of who they're signalling  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  to and how they control dynamics.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  So they'll actually feed disease organisms to control other plants or things like nap  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  weed has specific types of carbons that it's exuding that suppresses your entomopathogenic.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  And I always hate saying that word, but entomopathogenic meaning insect controlling diseases, it will  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  suppress that system in the soil around it.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:21):**  And it's like that those complexities are so fascinating.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:26):**  They are really intriguing.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  You mentioned a little bit ago and I referenced it as well.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  You mentioned that modern wheat varieties, some modern wheat varieties are losing their  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  capacity to transmit signals to soil biology to signal that they are being infected.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  Can you tell us a little bit more about that?  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:46):**  Well, I mean, I think that any time we're breeding for some single trait that we're  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  wanting to select for, you know, people know this in breeding cattle or sheep, you know,  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:56):**  we create unintended consequences when we start to do that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  And so there really hasn't been a focus on root systems or this need, vital need that,  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:06):**  you know, plants have evolved to have these relationships and actually through breeding  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:10):**  we're switched off those genes that will signal to mycorrhizae or switch off the genes to  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:15):**  communicate.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:17):**  And it's been interesting talking to plant breeders who are starting to realize what  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  they've been doing has been undermining resilience.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:24):**  It certainly undermines nutrient density of what we're growing because it's just like  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  in our gut system.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:30):**  If you think, you know, 90% of serotonin is produced by gut microbiology, they're now  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  saying a hundred percent of immunological disorders come from gut dysbiosis and the  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  same is true for soil.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  So if we undermine all of this different types of microbiology and signaling, we basically  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:47):**  have gut dysbiosis in the soil and then that's going to affect the quality of what we're  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:52):**  producing because we now don't have the hormones or the enzymes or the vitamins coming through  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:56):**  to that end product and as a result, we're basically growing garbage and garbage that's  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  in signaling to insects and diseases to clean it up.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  So if you think about it, if you were a seed producer and you were supplying fungicides  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  and pesticides and herbicides, it's the perfect sales model because here, use this product,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:15):**  you're now going to need this product and then you're going to need that product.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  And what we're finding is we can set plants up for insect resistance by getting these  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  biopriming on the seed basically and setting that plant up nutritionally if that's what  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  the problem is or some of these natural, like the entomopathogenic fungi for instance, won't  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  live in soils that are really, really compacted and have had high chemical use.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:40):**  So those natural organisms that control insects that are in the soil, so they actually live  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  like endophytes.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:47):**  So these fungi are inside that plant root system.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:51):**  So if something comes to chew on it, they'll infect it and when that insect dies, they  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  actually go out and they bring that nitrogen back into the plant or that phosphorus or  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  whatever's inside that insect and then supply that to the plant in exchange for living inside  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  its root systems.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  So if we change that signal and we're messing with that plant and it no longer allows an  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  insect, like an insect control vector like that into its root system, we're basically  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  undermining that whole plant.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:17):**  So there's another pathway, another mechanism for us to produce insect resistance in the  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  soil for wire worm and corn root worm for all these larval insects and so forth.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  Totally, totally.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  You know, we dug some holes once and it was in a kiwifruit orchard and like they'd use  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  so much chemical, like you can smell it coming off the ground and it was all covered in like  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  slime molds and I didn't even want to dig a hole.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:40):**  And then when we dug holes, there was like in a spade shovel by shovel, we counted 20  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:46):**  years and that was all that was in that soil.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  There wasn't any earthworms, there wasn't anything beneficial and it was like through  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:52):**  all that chemical use and compaction and loss of mineral cycling and organic matter, we  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:57):**  create the conditions for insect pests and then we're in a monoculture as well.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  So we don't have anything else growing and you know, off the thing runs rampant.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  So we really do see a big relationship with compaction and your redox potential with insect  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  pressure.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:12):**  You know, speaking of breeding and some of the perhaps unhealthy pathways that modern  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  breeding has gone down, it reminds me of a couple of examples of things that I've observed  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  and experienced.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:23):**  One is there are two breeders that I know personally who have both developed varieties  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  that they developed parent breeding lines that lasted for longer than five decades,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  over years because they were so robust and so strong.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  And these two different breeders were working on completely different crop species, but  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  they shared one characteristic in common that their breeding and their breeding work, they  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:48):**  focused specifically on developing vigorous root systems and large vascular systems.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  So large strong pipelines and large robust root systems.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  And their parent breeding material was so strong that it is still being used today 50  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:04):**  years later.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  And that to me, perhaps gives us an indicator of some of the directions that we should look  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:11):**  at and go down in our breeding work rather than focusing exclusively on specific quality  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:15):**  characteristics or whatever the case might be.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  When I think about wheat losing its capacity for signaling, when we think about plants  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:24):**  from a biophysics perspective rather than from a biochemistry perspective, then we recognize  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  that a plant is essentially an electrical antenna plugged into a magnetic grid that  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  we call the soil.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  And from this electro-magnetics perspective, DNA is essentially an antenna.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  It's vibrating at different frequencies and those various frequencies produce different  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:48):**  compounds through signaling mechanisms.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:51):**  But what has happened with wheat is more the ancient parent wheat genetics.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  When we used to have wheat that was five feet tall, six feet tall, had 18 chromosomes.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  And as a result of mutation breeding to develop short, sturdy wheat varieties that don't  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  lodge, modern wheat now has 44 chromosomes.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:16):**  So it is genetically bears no similarity to original parent wheat, or I shouldn't say  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  no similarity, but very limited similarity.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  So, when you look at that from a biophysics perspective, you'd say, well, this plant has  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:32):**  such a dramatically different plant genetically that it's no surprise that it can no longer  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  signal biology the way that the parents used to be able to.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:41):**  Well, though you'd wonder with all the extra chromosomes, shouldn't that give it more opportunities  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:47):**  to click into something else?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:49):**  And I think that's where we're seeing more of this focus on epigenetics in breeding.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  You know, if it's animals or plants, it's people realizing that five generations impact  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:00):**  that you can have through breeding.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  And I wonder if potentially that could make wheat even better in terms of being able to  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  adapt, because we've maybe built in some more adaptability than it would have.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  But yeah, I think the epigenetics is getting more and more focused now and I'm hearing  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:17):**  more producers talking about it, or even if they don't know that they're talking about  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:20):**  epigenetics, that's what they're talking about, which is, you know, how can you grow a plant  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  and stress it intentionally for, you know, heat or cold or wet or dry or low nutrients  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  and then continue to breed that plant that then has that expression so that plant has  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:36):**  the ability to kick in and survive when things go wet or dry.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  You know, and I think with what we're seeing globally right now is we need to be thinking  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  more about resilience.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  And I don't think you need to be necessarily buying seed from somebody to be doing that.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  But what is it that we're doing with our own cultivars or our own livestock to set them  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  up for resilience?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:55):**  When you speak about the capacity of additional chromosomes, what appears to me to be happening  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  is that the antenna functionality shifts from being a resonant antenna to becoming a dissonant  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  antenna and it's no longer resonating well with the entire ecosystem.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:11):**  And so you actually produce signals in the ecosystem that we probably don't very well  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:15):**  understand at this point, or largely because we don't know about them and are not measuring  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:19):**  them.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:20):**  But there's one example that comes to mind that I think speaks to this.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  This is actually a cotton grower that we have worked with who has noticed very distinctly  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  he's working with both Roundup Ready cotton and then he has some cotton that is both Roundup  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:33):**  Ready and BT and might have some other traits in it as well.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  I'm not entirely sure.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:37):**  But he has kept these different cultivars on separate soil.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  He has not rotated the different cultivars.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:45):**  And so the soil that only has the Roundup Ready cotton has a very distinct weed profile.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:54):**  The soil that has been growing cotton for the last decade that is both Roundup Ready  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  and has BT and has some of these other genetic modifications has a completely different weed  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:05):**  profile of much more aggressive weeds that are much more difficult to control.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  The herbicide program has been the same.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  All the other many characteristics have been the same, except we have different genetics  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  being grown on one soil.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  And so we know that there is horizontal gene transfer.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  We know that the material of one plant is transferred to biology and then onto other  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:23):**  plants.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  And so my sense is that we are growing plants.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  This is one of my concerns about genetic modification of some of the unintended and unknown second  
**[0:42:37-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  and third order consequences is that we are introducing a dissonant signal into the ecosystem  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  that is carving different types of weed and disease and insect expression that we may  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  not fully grasp or comprehend at this point.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:55):**  I'm totally with you on that.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:56):**  And I think the research that's coming out now on horizontal gene transfer, and it's  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:00):**  like we knew this over, you know, probably 30 years ago.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:04):**  And I mean, I was part of a group that we managed to create GU free New Zealand.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  So New Zealand does not have genetically engineered grown plants commercially in the country.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  The horizontal gene transfer was one of the arguments for that.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  It's like we don't understand this.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  We don't know how far it moves.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  And what we're seeing is that those genes can be moved way through the environment.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:28):**  I mean, biology moves.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  And it moves much faster than we might anticipate.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:33):**  Particularly when we're talking about biology and the soil profile.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  So coming back to our conversation about signaling and biology and the impact of biology and  
**[0:43:44-0:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  shifting this profile, producing disease suppressive soils, you mentioned a term that is not yet  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  widely known, I think, at least here in North America, and that is biopriming.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  All right.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:57):**  Tell us a little bit about biopriming seeds as in the example you provided of the Hagerty  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:02):**  operation and how farmers can dig into that a bit deeper.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:08):**  And what I like is my passion is how do we reduce inputs and basically have closed loop  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:13):**  systems on farm or ranch?  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:16):**  So that's been something that I've been really passionate about for a long time.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  So biopriming is very simple in terms of we're just looking at coding that seed in some kind  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:26):**  of diverse microbial inoculant or extract.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  So the Johnson Sue, which looking under a microscope, I see that as being very similar  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  to vermicast, good quality vermicast, some of the compost, some of the natural Korean  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:41):**  farming forms, and there's commercial inoculants obviously involved too.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  Basically we see more rapid germination.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  I just had a client send me through a whole lot of photographs that he's doing in Australia  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  with a GRDC project, which is pretty exciting to get the conventional grain guys on board.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  And looking at how much faster we see root development on seeds that have been bioprimed.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:05):**  And you've probably had this too, John, is someone will call you and say, my crop's not  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:10):**  up yet, but the neighbor's crop is and they're panicking.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  And I'll be like, well, dig a hole and take a look.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:14):**  And you'll find that you've got two or three inches of a root system before that shoots  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  even popped up above the ground.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  That happens from these biological signals basically.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  So all the different metabolites, all these things that microbes are exuding by getting  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:28):**  that extract.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  And again, it's parts per trillion onto the seed is setting that seed up because you think  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  these microbes produce things like oxens and gibberellins.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  And so, you know, your plant growth hormones for root development and also microbiology  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  that are really good at releasing bound phosphate or dealing with excesses of nutrients or whatever's  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  going on in your particular soil is by biopriming it.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  We really give that seed a headstart out of the gate.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:56):**  And then as that plant grows up and down, it's got microbiology all over it.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  So it's like a just this racetrack across their whole system.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:05):**  So as they grow, that microbiology is also populating and then making sure that it's  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  coating leaf surfaces.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:10):**  So if you look into, you know, what is it that breaks down waxy coatings, for instance.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  So you've got a hydrophobic soil, which is a big problem in Western Australia.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  Those waxy coatings are formed by bacteria trying to protect themselves.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  In vermicast, there's four different organisms that are actually responsible for chewing  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  up and breaking down those waxy coatings.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  And then some of the microorganisms in vermicast are known to actually change how that plant  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  experiences leaf stress or wilting or water stress and actually increases the humidity  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  around that leaf zone, which is really cool.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  And then we want to see these great big rhizosheets.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:47):**  And I call them the rustafarian roots, is that with biopriming, the minute that seed  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  comes out, we see that connection.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  So you'll see soils totally covering those root systems.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:58):**  So you can't actually see bare roots.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  And that is the interface for health.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:03):**  As far as I'm concerned, if you've got naked roots, you're in trouble.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  You've got no resilience.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:07):**  It's this, it's this rustafarian root that can do incredible stuff.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  Like it can actually buffer the pH in that rhizosheath by two units.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  So you might have a pH of five or nine and that plants experiencing seven.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  So they can buffer against heavy metals and all sorts of stuff.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  So we're seeing shrinking patches of alkali soils where we couldn't grow anything anymore.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  By biopriming that seed and then drilling seed into those areas, we're seeing those  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:32):**  areas shrinking.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  So that's been some of the cool visual stuff that we can see, but definitely seeing a reduction  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  in plant stress and better resilience against temperature fluctuations.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  Our observation, our experience has been that the use of high quality inoculation at planting  
**[0:47:49-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  is the lowest cost, highest return application that we can make in the transition to regenerative  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  agriculture.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  It just, oh, I love it.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:58):**  It's it wins economically over and over and over again when you compare different applications  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:02):**  on various crops.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  We, we reckon it's costing because we're making it ourselves.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  It costs anywhere from like 6 cents to maybe 30 cents an acre is what we're, what we're  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  spending.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  And it's like, that's a no brainer.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  I mean, I've been trying to encourage one of my clients forever to build a worm farm  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  because he's got, you know, he's got yards, he's got organic material, he's got manure  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  and straw and it's like, what, you know, just build some worm farms.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  And he finally did two years ago after about seven years of nagging and we figured out  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  his return on investment, like his cost per hour, he's earning maybe $500 an hour on his  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  vermicast production.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  And it's like, yeah, we need to be focusing on this stuff instead of like getting spread  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  very thin, vermiculture doesn't have to take a lot of time or investment into and a little  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  goes a very long way.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  And what's kind of cool is they're figuring out ways to kind of get those signals out.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  So we're dropping bags of vermicast or compost into like irrigation ditches, you know, just  
**[0:49:01-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:01):**  a burlap sack and just throwing it in a ditch.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  You know, it doesn't have to be high technology or high cost and just starting to think every  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:09):**  time we do anything, how can I get more microbiology out there?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  So one of my guys is actually feeding vermicast to his cows.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:17):**  So he's putting a little bit of that in his mineral and he puts it in his water and he's  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:20):**  like, I'm just, I'm going to inoculate that manure and use it as a probiotic and seeing  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  that manure breaking down so much faster.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  His dung beetles have now gone through the roof.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  We counted 700 dung beetles in one dung pie and he sent it off to Jonathan Lundgren, 700  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  dung beetles in this.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:41):**  He counted a very similar amount and you want to see it.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  And it was kind of scary because we were doing a workshop and I pulled this cow pie out of  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:48):**  the way because it was in the trench that we were looking at and it stank.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:52):**  And suddenly it sounded like a swarm of bees, like it was scary.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  And then there's all these dung beetles coming in.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  And this guy, before we started working together and using the bio-priming, he had no dung  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:03):**  beetles on the ranch whatsoever.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  Now he has all this diversity and it's kind of terrifying.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:09):**  Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:11):**  It's so fun.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:13):**  So Nicole, you've had the benefit of observing and working with many different growers in  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:20):**  different climates and regions and developing a very different perspective on agriculture  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:24):**  than the mainstream perhaps.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  What is something that you believe to be true about agriculture that is very different from  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:31):**  others in the community?  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  And given your work in regenerative agriculture, I might even narrow that context a little  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  bit and ask the question, what is the perspective and a point of view that you have that is  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:42):**  different from others in the regenerative ag community?  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  Oh, very good.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:45):**  I have a strong background in adult education and systems thinking and organizational learning  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  and extension.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:52):**  So I think for me, a lot of the time I come back to who are we being in this space?  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:00):**  Like our observations and our actions are given by who are we being about whatever's  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:06):**  happening.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  And what I find is that world of being shifts when people enter into regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  because you go from being someone who's about control and dominance, about having things  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  look really, really pretty and whatever you think pretty looks like, to being someone  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  who's willing to step outside of the norm.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:24):**  And that is one of the most challenging things that we can do.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  But if we just reach for a practice, if we just reach for a cover crop, if we just reach  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  to, hey, the answers here, we're back into that industrial mindset.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  So for me, the mindset stuff is probably the biggest part of my work and the stuff I'm  
**[0:51:43-0:51:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  most excited about.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:45):**  And we're doing some pretty big, I guess, behavior change type programs that we're seeing  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  some incredible success with.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  And so I think for me, I'm really deeply rooted in the sense of being and that being also  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  means where are we response able?  
**[0:52:00-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:00):**  Where are we accountable for ourselves and our lives and our landscapes?  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  And like for me, there's no separation.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:06):**  So I see that inner landscape so reflected in the outer landscape, but there's no separation.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  We're seeing degraded, parched, dysbiosis across the world.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:18):**  And we're seeing that in people as well.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:20):**  And so I think I kind of connect a lot of what's happening with people with the land.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  And I'm really interested in that angle.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:26):**  I've had conversations with people that have blown my mind, but I can really see how that  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:31):**  has shifted someone's entire world in terms of how do we look at land and how do we interact  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  with it?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:37):**  And I came across something recently that I wanted to share with you that I was reading  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:41):**  this book called The Longest Echo.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:44):**  Sorry if this is a trigger warning for some of you, but it was about World War II and  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:48):**  during the German genocides.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:52):**  The true story is based in Italy and basically these SES agents come in and they kill all  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:57):**  the women, children, grandparents, everybody.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:01):**  At the end of the book, they were looking at what happened to those SES agents after  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:05):**  the war.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  And what they found was, you know, those people, many of them were very educated, very intelligent.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  They went back to having normal lives with their families and settling down.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  You know, they didn't continue to be these mass murderers.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  And they looked at a hundred different case studies of people that went to court for atrocities.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  And they're like, you know, were these people threatened with their lives?  
**[0:53:27-0:53:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  Were they threatened with something equal to what they were going to dole out?  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:30):**  Was it going to be a horrible punishment if they didn't do these terrible things to people?  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:34):**  And what they found was that was not the case.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  And so her take home was that, I'll just quote you this, that there's a simple truth.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  It takes unimaginable strength to be different, to break away from what your peers are doing  
**[0:53:48-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  is one of the hardest things for anyone.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  That those people, the SES agents were more concerned about fitting in and doing what  
**[0:53:55-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:55):**  everybody else was doing and worrying about what the neighbors would think.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  And it's one of the most powerful things around behavior change.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  And we can use that for good.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  We can use that talent because people are concerned about, especially in agriculture,  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  what do my neighbors think?  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:11):**  And so I'm working with a producer right now who's, he's very humble.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:16):**  He's very kind.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  He's doing a great job with his land.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  I mean, you see the water sink into his property.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  You see, you know, really, really healthy livestock.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  He's just doing awesome stuff.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:25):**  He doesn't tell anyone else what to do, but he talks to people quietly.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  We've done quite a few workshops at his place and we calculated in a 10 mile radius that  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  50% of his neighbors now are running regenerative adaptive grazing management.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  And so my take home from all of this is we need to speak up.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  We need to be willing to be at the pub or the saloon or wherever you hang out and start  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  speaking our truth because it's our truth that's going to make the difference here.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:51):**  It's sharing our own personal stories and starting to communicate what's working well  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:56):**  for us is what changes things.  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  It's not data.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:59):**  It's not having more information.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:01):**  It's not more trials.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  It's us being willing to communicate.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:04):**  And this is what I'm seeing with the Corum Sense Group in New Zealand is this extraordinary  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  network.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:10):**  They're a WhatsApp group.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  They share their stories.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  There's no dogma.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:14):**  And I think that's what I love about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  This is not dogmatic.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  If you want to do a certain practice, you do that, you know, and sometimes you might  
**[0:55:21-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  use antibiotics.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  Sometimes you might be using herbicides or whatever, that there's this space that we  
**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  are all working through this and doing the best that we can do.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:30):**  But through sharing our successes and our failures, we're creating this this world that's  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  actually changing really fast, John.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  And I'm very excited.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:38):**  Yeah, one of the thank you for that perspective, that review, I completely agree with you that  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:45):**  it is it is up to each of us to help create the change that we wanted to see in the world  
**[0:55:50-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:50):**  by speaking up and by making our voices heard.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  And within that context, there is a quote that I've shared many times with our team  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:59):**  here at AEA and I've even talked about it occasionally.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  It's a slight paraphrase of a quote from Otto Scharmer, who's a MIT researcher on systems  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:08):**  change.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:09):**  The quote is, the outcome of an intervention has nothing to do with the skills of the intervener.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:16):**  It has everything to do with the place within from which the intervener comes.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:21):**  Yes, yes.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:22):**  And so when you think about that, when you think about having empathy for the landscape,  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  having empathy for our neighbors who have a different perspective than we do, who haven't  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:31):**  yet heard the things that we've heard, they haven't experienced what we've experienced.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  It's when we are able to truly empathize with people and communicate from that place of  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  empathy, that will determine our ability to actually make a difference.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  Yeah, I'm totally with you.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:49):**  And I think sometimes people feel like, who am I in this space or who am I to speak up?  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  Or, you know, I'm just doing this small part.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:57):**  And it's like all of those smart, small parts of what's making the whole.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:00):**  And I think don't undervalue that.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  And yeah, this has been my joy, I guess, of being able to live with people.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  So I live on the road and I live in people's houses with families is that empathy is so  
**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:13):**  important because we all have these different challenges going on.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:17):**  And I think no matter where you go in the world, people still care about the same things.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:21):**  You know, they care about their families.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  They you know, they want to they want to be healthy.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  They those relationships are the most important part.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  And it's it is too easy to focus on the wrong and right when there's no wrong and right  
**[0:57:34-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  in this space at all.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  Yeah, it's just a journey of discovery.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  Yeah, painting things is wrong and right.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  And negative or positive or black and white is generally not very helpful.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  And I'm thinking specifically about till versus no till.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:51):**  Yeah, yeah, I think one of the biggest the biggest fights I've ever seen was with a group  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  of biodynamic practitioners.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:58):**  Like it was it was so funny to be an observer of the minute we start to get really like  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:04):**  it has to be this way.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  That's where conflict arises.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:08):**  And I think we're just all going to be open to you know what works well for you.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:12):**  And I think that's the context thing that's so important is, you know, we can read something  
**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  or see something or hear something that you know, so and so did this in Argentina and  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  it worked really well and therefore it's going to work well for me and Alberta, Canada.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:25):**  And I think always, this is what I love about this space is it's it is innovation.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  And this is why I'm really resistant to this idea of like, we're gonna say what regenerative  
**[0:58:35-0:58:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:35):**  agriculture is, because for me, the only way to frame it is through its outcomes.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:39):**  You know, are you improving wellness?  
**[0:58:42-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:42):**  Are you improving water infiltration?  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  Are you improving the quality of what you're producing, instead of you know, regenerative  
**[0:58:48-0:58:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:48):**  agriculture must be these things because it's an incredibly innovative space right now.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:52):**  And it's a lot of fun.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  This is really intriguing because I've not had this conversation publicly yet.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:58:58):**  I'm intending to write a blog post about it in the next week or two, but I share your  
**[0:59:02-0:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:02):**  sentiment that regenerative agriculture should not be defined yet, maybe never.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:10):**  And the reason I have that perspective is because first of all, if we have the desire,  
**[0:59:16-0:59:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  and I think we should have, to have regenerative agriculture become mainstream globally, then  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  that by default means we have a desire for regenerative agriculture to be inclusive,  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  to not have people who are in or out.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  And we also need to recognize, as you pointed out, that regenerative agriculture is not  
**[0:59:34-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:34):**  the destination.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  It's about the journey.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:36):**  It's about a journey, a constant improvement and constant further development.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  So I think one of the challenges, one of the reasons organic agriculture, organic certification  
**[0:59:46-0:59:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  has not been more widely adopted is because the moment you create a standard and a certification  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:53):**  where there is an in-group and there is also by default an out-group, and that is not a  
**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:59:58):**  situation that we wish to see in regenerative agriculture, at least for the foreseeable  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  future.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  No.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:05):**  You know, and there are a number of organizations obviously that are wanting to create certification  
**[1:00:10-1:00:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  around this space, and for me it does come back to those measurable outcomes.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:17):**  You know, and then someone said to me, well, if you have an asphalt car park and then you  
**[1:00:21-1:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  have one weed growing in it, is that regenerative?  
**[1:00:24-1:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:24):**  Because we've got now a weed growing in there and we didn't have anything before.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:29):**  You know, these challenges of, oh, how do you define that something is improving?  
**[1:00:33-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:33):**  At what point is something improving or not?  
**[1:00:35-1:00:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  But I think to have very clear, measurable outcomes of the things that we're concerned  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:40):**  about and I think we've seen some great studies on the reduction of greenhouse gases, you  
**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  know, from regenerative practices or even nil residue for me, which is really interesting,  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:51):**  is we can still be using some agriculture chemicals and be measuring nil residues in  
**[1:00:56-1:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:00:56):**  the crops that are produced because we have this biodiverse, very robust biological system  
**[1:01:02-1:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:02):**  that is actually able to break those materials down.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:06):**  So for me that's kind of fascinating in terms of what are some of the things we could measure.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:10):**  You know, we see more and more people coming to the table who have proposals around what  
**[1:01:14-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:14):**  could be measured.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  Nicole, from your perspective, what most limits farmers from achieving the tremendous untapped  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:21):**  potential that they're capable of?  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:23):**  Their mindset.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:25):**  Their mindset about what's possible.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  It was quite funny.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:29):**  I was talking to a cropping guy in Australia and he said, every time you talk to me, I  
**[1:01:32-1:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  get a headache.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:33):**  I'm like, oh, thanks buddy.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:37):**  But what I was finding with him is he would just immediately go into overwhelm and I'm  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:42):**  too old was the story he was telling himself.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:44):**  And I'm like, dude, you're the same age as me.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:46):**  You know, I don't want to hear that you're too old.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:49):**  Is there's this thinking that even in the back of their minds, they're going to do some  
**[1:01:53-1:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:53):**  kind of practice.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:54):**  All right, we're going to put in a cover crop.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  In the back of their mind they're thinking, this is going to fail.  
**[1:01:58-1:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  I know this isn't going to work.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:01:59):**  I'm not going to get rain or this is going to be disaster or what will the neighbors  
**[1:02:02-1:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:02):**  think?  
**[1:02:03-1:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:03):**  But actually that mindset, that really is what drags the system down.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:07):**  And I know you've had quite a few people that have tapped into the energy component of intent  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:12):**  and you can see where intent can have an impact on landscape.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  So I think if you've got a bad attitude, if your mindset is that you're not going to do  
**[1:02:22-1:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:22):**  things well, then you won't.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  You'll get the timing wrong.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:24):**  You'll seed at the wrong time.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:26):**  You'll use the wrong crops if that's what you're using.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  You won't manage your livestock.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:30):**  You won't move them in time or you leave them for too long or whatever because of your thinking,  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  I don't have the time.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:37):**  I don't have the money.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  I don't have all of this.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:40):**  And it's all just an internal story.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:42):**  So one thing that my entire team goes and trains in is they go and do the Landmark Forum,  
**[1:02:47-1:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:47):**  which is offered by Landmark Worldwide.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:50):**  And it's a personal and professional development program.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  And what it does is it enables you to see your blind spots.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:02:56):**  And for me, that is the biggest part of the story is what is your blind spot around success.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  We're actually going to do, we're doing a number of courses that we've got online, but  
**[1:03:05-1:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:05):**  one of them is going to be about the ecology of money and around how people see money and  
**[1:03:10-1:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:10):**  how we have stories about money.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:12):**  Like I can't have too much money because therefore I'm greedy or I've got a lot of Irish blood.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:18):**  So life is struggle and money is struggle.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:21):**  We walk around with these stories about money and if we can uncover those stories of what  
**[1:03:26-1:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:26):**  we have around success and money, it's extraordinary what then becomes possible.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:30):**  So I really recommend people do professional development on themselves because we're running  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  businesses here.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:37):**  And I think actually that was my biggest shock coming to the US is New Zealand farming is  
**[1:03:41-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:41):**  very much a business.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  And I came here and it's like, it's especially ranching.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  It's like a lifestyle.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:47):**  That business component isn't necessarily there.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  So yeah, there was a bit of a surprise.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  I find your perspective on money really intriguing.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:03:57):**  The non-agricultural book that I recommend the most is Secrets of the Millionaire Mind.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:02):**  When you go through that, it's first of all, it's an incredible book, but it really reveals  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:07):**  your perspectives on money and economics and success, which you described, which then also  
**[1:04:13-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:13):**  those patterns, those beliefs, those hidden beliefs that you picked up from your family  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  or your community or surroundings really limit your potential.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:20):**  And you may not even be aware of them.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:22):**  And to your point about having negative beliefs about your individual capacity to create change  
**[1:04:30-1:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  and that those intentions manifesting, I've actually observed that to be true also when  
**[1:04:37-1:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:37):**  some members of the team are not bought in to making change in the farms.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:41):**  If you have a larger organization, larger operation, there's multiple levels of management.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  Sometimes a farmer farm owner wants to make changes, but the farm managers aren't bought  
**[1:04:51-1:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  in.  
**[1:04:53-1:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:53):**  They will find a way to make it fail.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:56):**  Not intentional.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  They may not intend to have it fail, but it will not be successful if they don't believe  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:01):**  it's going to be successful.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:02):**  It's quite remarkable to observe how that pattern repeats itself over and over again.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:07):**  It's so very true.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:08):**  And it's actually why we created what we thought of as our ideal client.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  And what was at the bottom of the list were the corporate organizations or absentee owners.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:17):**  And they actually became, these are not clients that we want to work with.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:20):**  And actually of this moment, and this is the first announcement I've made of this, Integrity  
**[1:05:24-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:24):**  Soils, my company, is going back to its roots and we're no longer offering consultancy or  
**[1:05:29-1:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  coaching in the field.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:30):**  We're just focusing on the education, which is where we came from.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:35):**  And part of it is this complexity of working with corporate structures.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:39):**  All it takes is one out of that entire machine to unwind everything that people were out  
**[1:05:44-1:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:44):**  to create.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:45):**  And they're going to have the best of intentions and just things don't go well.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:48):**  It was part of the reason I left New Zealand was working with three corporates and just  
**[1:05:52-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:52):**  going, I just don't have the stomach for it.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:05:55):**  What's something I want to have a follow up conversation with you about?  
**[1:06:00-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:00):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  Nicole, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[1:06:04-1:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:04):**  Something I wish all farmers knew is, oh gosh, there's a few things.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:07):**  But I think that to really recognize and celebrate the contribution that we add to the planet,  
**[1:06:14-1:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:14):**  I mean, what are we up to now?  
**[1:06:15-1:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:15):**  Like 98% of the world feeds upon the 2% on the ground.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:20):**  And what we are doing is growing food and growing extraordinary food.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:26):**  And I think if you keep that in mind of just that beautiful creation that we're involved  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:31):**  in, it becomes very hard to do some of the inhumane practices that I see on some farms,  
**[1:06:36-1:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:36):**  or it becomes very hard to go, I'm going to do this desiccant, this chemical desiccant.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:42):**  You know, I hear from some producers how they grow their own organic food behind the house,  
**[1:06:48-1:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  but they would never eat their own food that they're producing.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:51):**  And I think to remember what it is that we are producing and to keep honoring that because  
**[1:06:56-1:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:56):**  if we all get back to that, then so much of this becomes abhorrent.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:06:59):**  We can't be producing this chemical laden industrial food anymore.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:03):**  Well, it's not even food because we are holding everyone's health in our hands, the health  
**[1:07:07-1:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:07):**  of the planet and the health of the people.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:10):**  So interesting, I've heard that sentiment expressed as well that we're growing our own  
**[1:07:14-1:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  separate patch of food for our own family.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:17):**  And you know, that food that we would not, the stuff that we are growing that we would  
**[1:07:21-1:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:21):**  not consider feeding to our family, there's a very good probability we're feeding that  
**[1:07:25-1:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:25):**  to our future sons-in-law or daughters-in-law that will become family.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:31):**  So we do have a larger responsibility.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:33):**  Yeah, and I think especially when we see what's coming out in epigenetics around fungicides  
**[1:07:39-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:39):**  and pesticides and the effect on grandchildren and great grandchildren is we've already set  
**[1:07:44-1:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:44):**  this wheel in progress.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:46):**  So how to kind of halt it now, we have an opportunity to halt that now.  
**[1:07:50-1:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:50):**  And we used to produce just a small number of lambs and we had lamb farmers come and  
**[1:07:56-1:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:07:56):**  buy lamb off us because they're spraying fields out with glyphosate and then feeding lambs  
**[1:08:01-1:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:01):**  and ewes on it.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:02):**  They know what they produce didn't taste as good.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:06):**  And I think if you're not happy eating your own food, you should really be questioning  
**[1:08:09-1:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:09):**  what you're doing.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:10):**  What is a topic that you would like to speak about more frequently, but you hesitate because  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  you sense farmers may not be ready to hear it yet?  
**[1:08:19-1:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  Ha ha ha.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:20):**  Oh, you're good, John.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:22):**  Yeah, I think it's a conversation that's opening up more and more.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:26):**  And I think particularly, I think it's part of why I am a good educator because I feel  
**[1:08:32-1:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:32):**  like I'm a good educator is that I listen to people, I listen to their body language,  
**[1:08:38-1:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:38):**  I'm listening to all of the nonverbal signals and it's the same on landscapes.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:43):**  So I'm listening to land all the time from animals to hearing things.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  And what's been interesting is how more and more I'm hearing the land speak.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:54):**  And I was really reluctant to share that.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  And so like last year I was on Olderspring Ranch, which I highly recommend people go  
**[1:09:00-1:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  and look up and I spent two months out there and they practice what they call in herding.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:05):**  So they're basically moving cattle like the bison would have once moved.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:10):**  And I look back over my shoulder and what I saw coming over the hill was bison, but  
**[1:09:16-1:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  it wasn't, there were no bison there.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:18):**  And I felt them come past me like I could actually feel their fur and the wind move  
**[1:09:24-1:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:24):**  and hear the sound.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:25):**  And then I heard this voice very clearly say, we are so grateful that you are here.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:30):**  Like the people, like the ranches themselves.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:32):**  And so I went, I was kind of embarrassed and I was like, hey, this is going to sound really  
**[1:09:37-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  weird, but I need to tell you this.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  And so yeah, the ranch himself got quite teary and he's like, I know.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:45):**  And how much of this we actually know.  
**[1:09:47-1:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:47):**  We know that the land is grateful.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:49):**  We know that the animals are grateful.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:51):**  And there, I've gone and shared it publicly now, but I feel larger from that experience.  
**[1:09:57-1:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:09:57):**  Like my chest and my whole body expands when I'm in that space of just deeply listening.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:03):**  And so this is why it's weird these days for me to do podcasts, because I'm feeling like  
**[1:10:08-1:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  it's not a time for me to be speaking.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:10):**  It's a time for me to be listening.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  And I think that's what's coming out of COVID is we've kind of grabbed onto this commodity  
**[1:10:16-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:16):**  of knowledge and we're consuming information at this rapid rate.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  And what it's creating is more and more overwhelmed, more and more sense of like, either we're  
**[1:10:24-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  stupid or we don't know enough or we got to learn more.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:27):**  We're filling up this bag when really it's time to be still.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:31):**  COVID is asking us to just stop.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:34):**  And I think just go and stop and be with your animals, be with your trees and listen.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  And I've heard things from trees.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  I've heard things from animals.  
**[1:10:42-1:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  My mom's going to love that I share this because she talks to trees.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:47):**  But some of my mentors, Bruce Tainio that I mentioned, who was an amazing microbiologist  
**[1:10:51-1:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:51):**  and who was one of the breeders also that I talked about who produced this incredible  
**[1:10:56-1:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:10:56):**  parent seed stock, used to have conversations with trees all the time.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:00):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:01):**  Well, yeah.  
**[1:11:02-1:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  And what's often interesting to me is there is research that backs that up too.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  So my analytical mind is like, there's no research for that.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:09):**  But actually there is.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:11):**  Yeah, there is.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:12):**  But the voices that I'm hearing are very much not my voice and they're very clear and they're  
**[1:11:17-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:17):**  very encouraging and kind.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  And I'm like, I don't know where it's coming from and I don't need to know where it's coming  
**[1:11:23-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:23):**  from.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  I just want to celebrate the fact that while we're busy, busy up above the land, that the  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:30):**  land is actually listening and the microbiology are listening.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:33):**  You know, you go into walk into a field and there is a signal that runs right through  
**[1:11:37-1:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:37):**  that field and that those microbes are communicating to plants on the other side of that hill to  
**[1:11:41-1:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:41):**  say, oh, you know, John's back.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:43):**  You know?  
**[1:11:44-1:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:44):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:45-1:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:45):**  It happens instantly.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:47):**  Instant.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:48):**  Magic.  
**[1:11:49-1:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:49):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:11:50):**  Nicole, thank you very much for being here and for sharing your wisdom and knowledge.

**[1:12:23-1:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Nicole_Masters_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  And since 2006, we've worked with leading professional growers to help them do just

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Thu, 24 Feb 2022 19:28:22)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:04):**  talk about the agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate plant health,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:09):**  soil health, and public health, and of course very importantly, regenerate farm profitability  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:15):**  and the pathway to achieving all these other outcomes. I'm really excited to be having a  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:20):**  conversation for this episode with Joe Lewis who has been on the forefront of a lot of foundational  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:27):**  research on how insects communicate with their environment, with their plants, and with identifying  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:34):**  target insects. So I'm really excited to have Joe here. He has also published a new book recently  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:40):**  titled A New Farm Language and this is a topic that's really important to me personally because  
**[0:00:46-0:00:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:46):**  I think we constrain ourselves a lot by the choice of words that we use. Words are powerful and if we  
**[0:00:56-0:01:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:56):**  constantly refer to things as pests or weeds or pathogens, then to some degree we're creating the  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:04):**  reality that we expect and we would be wise, I believe, to choose better words and to develop a  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:10):**  new lexicon and a new language. So, but Joe, the title of your book really spoke to me a lot. I  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:15):**  really appreciated it and thank you for being here today. Can you tell us a little bit about your  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:21):**  background and your story and what brought you to doing some of this foundational research?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:27):**  Sure, John, and let me say it's a delight to be with you today. I'm looking forward to the  
**[0:01:32-0:01:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:32):**  conversation. I've seen some of your work and your broadcast and I'm excited to be a part of  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:40):**  it today and it's an exciting thing and we share so much of the same view and hopefully we can  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:48):**  have a good conversation and communicate some of those to the audience. So I look forward to it.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:54):**  My background, of course, I just completed an exciting career as a scientist in the field  
**[0:02:03-0:02:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:03):**  of entomology and agriculture specifically, but after 40 plus years of academic  
**[0:02:13-0:02:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:13):**  research and being in that field, I want to point out my earlier years were far from scholarly.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:23):**  I grew up in a very remote rural area of South Mississippi as a sharecropper's son. My father  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:31):**  was illiterate, couldn't read or write a single word. The earlier years of my life,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:39):**  no electricity, no running water, none of the modern conveniences.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:44):**  And then I had the opportunity later to go through and have a good education and to be a part of the  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:54):**  modern technology in the world from a very different view for 40 plus years. So I've seen  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:01):**  the world from both sides now and let's talk a little bit, if I could, about those earlier years.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:10):**  I refer to it and I speak of it as being like Charles Dickens. It was the worst of times  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:16):**  and best of times. It was the worst of times. That type of life can be very rugged  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:22):**  and particularly from a perspective of today when we're used to our air conditioning and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:30):**  all the modern conveniences of running water and those kind of things. But it was the best of time  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:39):**  in that we were a part of nature. We didn't just see nature, we were of nature. When you  
**[0:03:48-0:03:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:48):**  do not have any electric lights and those type of things, number one, you have to live as a part of  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:57):**  nature and hear the sounds of nature, see and feel nature. You have to do things by the light  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:05):**  because you don't have the convenience of electric lights and other kinds of things.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:11):**  You don't have the commotions of all the commerce and you hear and see and experience nature in a  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:19):**  very, very different way. You can read and you understand the language of nature.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:27):**  I think that is huge. You also see the true marvels and understand and appreciate the fact  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:34):**  that nature is a web. You don't see it in the reductionist view that we do at the current time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:44):**  As Rachel Carson said, in nature nothing exists alone and you see and experience that and you  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:52):**  see it's truly a system. Nature and our world is made up of systems within systems.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:00):**  But in our modern world, we centralize and specialize things and you see it in parts.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:14):**  We lose so much in the power and we've become very interventionist oriented.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:20):**  So I watched that occur over my life in the earlier stages as that took place.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:25):**  This process of fragmentation and this mechanistic view of trying to identify and understand the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:33):**  parts, I think is based on the premise of the mistaken belief that if you understand the parts,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:40):**  then you can also understand the whole. I think we're beginning to recognize that that is not the  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:45):**  case. You cannot understand the whole just because you recognize the parts. This is really a  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:50):**  challenge in our agricultural research because if anything is a description of managing an ecosystem,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:57):**  it should be agriculture. Yet our agricultural science has all been fragmented to where we have  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:04):**  people studying very specific things rather than the whole ecosystem. Absolutely. Let me compare  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:10):**  that a little bit about kind of what I saw earlier and go back to say a couple of things of that  
**[0:06:15-0:06:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:15):**  because of the way I grew up and saw those things. It helped me to see things different and observe  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:24):**  things as I got into my research. So hold that. I want to come through that and not forget it.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:29):**  But see as you grow up in true subsistence farming, the way we lived and farmed, we were  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:37):**  a sharecropper. We didn't own the land, so we lived on, maybe had access to maybe 50,000  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:44):**  acres or something like that where we had to make our living and actually grow our food.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:49):**  We had five acres of cotton as a cash crop. That was the only, I guess, money that we had.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:58):**  Everything else, we grew our food. In that kind of living, you see the interaction of the parts.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:05):**  You have chickens, you have cows, and you have your mule, and you have the cotton and  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:13):**  corn to feed the cattle and the chickens who all were free-range chickens. So you  
**[0:07:20-0:07:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:20):**  knew your connection to the land. You had the cows, you milked them, you had the churn of butter,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:28):**  all those things all the way back to the land. You understood those connections and the interactions  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:35):**  of the part. You also saw things like if you had marten houses and so forth to see them to  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:45):**  chase the hawks and to protect the chickens. You saw all the interactions.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:53):**  For a child with a robust curiosity, which I have, you're exploring and you see the adventures,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:02):**  the beauty, and also the power within the natural world and how interactive and integrated it was.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:12):**  You didn't see it in its part. Seeing the world in that way, I think it helped me in the research  
**[0:08:22-0:08:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:22):**  not to break things in its part. We understood that even as we studied, I got into a very strong interest  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:36):**  very early in my career of biological control and natural enemies of herbivores, primarily the  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:44):**  parasitic wasp. That became the primary subject of my study. I could see when you took  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:53):**  those little parasitic wasps out of nature and start producing them and left, once you  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:00):**  unplug them from that natural system, you didn't have the same organism. It was very different.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:07):**  So that gets at the point that you were making. I think it helped to understand  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:19):**  the world is an integrated system and to get the best of the research and to understand  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:27):**  natural systems, you have to study it in its whole. That's the way we did our research.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:34):**  So tell us a little bit about the research. I mentioned briefly that you were a pioneer or  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:42):**  an early group of researchers looking at developing biological controls and  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:48):**  kind of practical entomology from an agricultural perspective. Tell us about what brought you there  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:55):**  and what got started. Well, as I was saying, I got developed interest real early just from  
**[0:10:02-0:10:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:02):**  looking at insects and agriculture and particularly production of cotton and corn and row crops in the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:10):**  south. I developed a strong interest in the natural enemies and particularly the model  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:17):**  that we can discuss a bit here that we use were the parasitic wasps.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:23):**  What we recognized, if we were going to use biological control and to remove away from so  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:32):**  much emphasis on pesticides and interventions and capture the natural power built within,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:41):**  these were very important things. The key to their reliability and successful implementation  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:50):**  was how does a female parasitic wasp find those herbivores.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:57):**  That became the key point of our study very early because you think about it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:04):**  Here you have a little parasitic wasp that can develop only in a certain types of caterpillars  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:11):**  that's playing hide and seek with them in a huge,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:15):**  field of cotton and all the vegetative growth. How do they find those little caterpillars and  
**[0:11:24-0:11:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:24):**  deposit an egg within them? That was the heart of this. As we begin to uncover some things,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:34):**  it really got exciting because one of the things that we found was the plant has attributes we had  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:45):**  no idea that existed. We found in the first discovery, the first report of the fact that  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:55):**  plants when they're being fed on a plant, they're being fed on a plant that's not  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:02):**  plants when they're being fed on by a caterpillar or any other herbivore.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:09):**  They have an attribute that we did not know and that was they have the ability to begin to produce  
**[0:12:17-0:12:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:17):**  and emit body odors like an SOS signal sending out a cry for help to their natural enemy and recruit  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:27):**  them to their aid. The wasp is able to locate the holes based on that signal from the plant.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:37):**  Had we suggested that a few years earlier, we would have been laughed out of the profession,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:43):**  but it is an inducible response. We really got into working out how does this occur? What's  
**[0:12:51-0:13:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:51):**  the mechanism by which a plant can talk and send signals to their bodyguards? We will call them the  
**[0:13:02-0:13:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:02):**  parasitic wasp. What we found is that when the caterpillar or any herbivore we later found,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:12):**  all plants have this ability as we went on, but when we first discovered we were working primarily  
**[0:13:17-0:13:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:17):**  with corn and cotton, when they wound the plant, they start munching on the fruit or leaf or  
**[0:13:26-0:13:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:26):**  whatever, the plant detects this feeding and begins to crank up a set of chemical factors  
**[0:13:38-0:13:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:38):**  and produce a group of six, seven, ten compounds, a blend of body odors and emit those odors.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:50):**  These are quite volatile materials. You don't see it,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:58):**  but the wasp can see it. It's kind of like a smoke signal that the plant is emitting to recruit them.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:04):**  Now what we found using wind tones and other study methods is if you just wound the plant with say a  
**[0:14:17-0:14:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:17):**  razor blade or somehow cut it or wound it, this doesn't happen. What happens is that there's an  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:27):**  elicitor we found in the spit of the caterpillar. If you take the spit of the caterpillar and put  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:34):**  on you wound it artificially and put the spit of the caterpillar, you get the same thing that  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:40):**  happens naturally. There's an elicitor and we are working with Jim Tomlinson who was my chemist  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:47):**  friend that did all this work with me. This elicitor triggers the plant to do that. So  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:56):**  you have to have the spit of the caterpillar. He and his group identified that chemical which was  
**[0:15:04-0:15:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:04):**  a fatty acid. Anyway, this is the way that it's heard. Now each herbivore they do it for any feeding,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:17):**  but they produce a different blend slightly different for each herbivore.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:23):**  So if you have an army worm and a bow worm, aphids, any other insect feeding on it, they're  
**[0:15:34-0:15:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:34):**  producing these body odors for each one of these. Now because of that, it would be of low value  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:45):**  if the natural enemy, if the parasitic wasp couldn't recognize the difference between  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:51):**  these. If you see what I'm saying, then the blend is a little different and they recognize  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:59):**  the blend for each. Only their whole family would be able to distinguish it.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:04):**  So basically, I want to hear your comment, but just to say it is because they're sending  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:13):**  a little different. It's like you're going into the store and you're getting different items and  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:18):**  you have a barcode and the barcode is a little different for each. They are sending a different  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:26):**  signal and the parasitic can, they're talking to the wasp and they're telling them something's  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:33):**  feeding on it and what it is. So there it's actually truly like a language if you see what I'm saying.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:39):**  Wow. So plants produce a unique signal for every pest, every insect herbivore. Just look at that.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:49):**  I just used the word pest again. For every insect herbivore that feeds on them, a unique one for  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:55):**  each one. What is the distance that this signal reaches? What's the sensitivity of these parasitic  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:02):**  wasps and how accurately can they perceive which plants are infected or which fields are infected?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:11):**  We know it's like parts per billion. It amounts to the fact that if you're sitting in this room  
**[0:17:19-0:17:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:19):**  and you have a few molecules just emitted, they can pick it up. It's incredibly sensitive  
**[0:17:27-0:17:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:27):**  and they can navigate and follow these odors in a little turbulent environment. We actually  
**[0:17:36-0:17:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:36):**  did those kind of studies and found that they're able to navigate those very good. So it really is  
**[0:17:46-0:17:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:46):**  an incredible sensitive system that is certainly in the range of the same thing as the bloodhound.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:56):**  We did those types of studies. Now there's another side of this, John.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:04):**  Since there's a different blend and because they're emitting these all these odors  
**[0:18:15-0:18:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:15):**  in response to any herbivore feeding on it and they also the plant let's say you have a  
**[0:18:23-0:18:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:23):**  the bowworm for example that's feeding on cotton. These are the cornea worm or an army worm.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:34):**  Our study was really with wasps of the bowworm. Primarily we did some with army worms too.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:42):**  These are polyphagus insects as we call them. They feed on a variety of different plants.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:49):**  All these plants are signaled. The signal is the same basic mechanism in the plant  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:58):**  but it's different on different plants. What I'm saying is they've got to follow a different  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:06):**  signal in cotton or corn or some early season annual that their host is feeding on.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:13):**  So they can't afford to hardwire this signal. They just don't have the innate ability  
**[0:19:22-0:19:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:22):**  in a specific plant signal sent to them. So how do they respond to a different blend or a signal  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:33):**  variation from one plant to the next or one age of plant to the next? They can't hardwire that.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:41):**  So we find they accomplish that. That's exactly it. They learn and they are incredibly good at  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:52):**  learning and we really work that system out. So let's talk a little bit about that learning  
**[0:19:59-0:20:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:59):**  mechanism. What they do is the same as occurs in vertebrates. In 1988 we actually reported in nature  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:14):**  the first demonstration with these wasps of true associative learning with these insects.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:21):**  What happens when they encounter the site and there's the caterpillar host and they have feces  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:31):**  where they have fed or they touch the caterpillar they've set. There is a chemical in the feces  
**[0:20:39-0:20:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:39):**  that actually comes from the peritropic membrane and are only insect itself, the caterpillar.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:47):**  We find that we didn't identify that but it's a glycoprotease, a real heavy compound chemical  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:55):**  that is host specific. This is hardware. This is what you call in associative learning the  
**[0:21:03-0:21:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:03):**  unconditional cue. It's hardwired and when they touch this with their antenna they have  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:12):**  a taste receptor and also taste receptors on these on the overposid.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:21):**  They make this contact. They link whatever volatile odors are with that. So it's an associative  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:30):**  link. When they taste while they smell they learn this odor which is the conditioned cue.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:37):**  They learn this odor means host. It's like saying this is what the host is feeding on. This is what  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:43):**  they smell like in this patch of host and they start following that specific signal. They can  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:50):**  learn and update every time they encounter a different patch of host and know what they're  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:55):**  feeding on, how it smells. They then learn that plant signal for that situation. You see what  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:03):**  I'm saying? It's an incredibly quick. In the learning process, if you release a  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:10):**  have a wasp or it naturally occurs in a patch of host for about the first two or three hosts,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:18):**  they encounter it's a little slower but then they learn what's occurring in this patch and  
**[0:22:25-0:22:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:25):**  the efficiency gets real strong through learning. So the wasp learns and the caterpillar plant  
**[0:22:34-0:22:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:34):**  sends its signal and they are working together as allies competing and managing this sneaky  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:43):**  caterpillar that's caught between the two kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:49):**  When we think about the capacity to learn, there's the capacity to learn these various odors which is  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:58):**  really remarkable but plants also change in structure and shape as they grow and mature as  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:04):**  well. I would imagine that the locations where caterpillars are found on plants also change as  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:09):**  plants mature. We know that some larval insects focus on feeding on blossoms or  
**[0:23:15-0:23:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:15):**  on corn silk for example or something like that. Is there also learning that goes on in regards  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:24):**  to the location of where these caterpillars might be found or these larvae might be found?  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:28):**  The deeper the well, the sweeter the honey. The further we get into this, the richer it gets.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:35):**  Yes, not only did they learn this wasp, we're talking about smart insects.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:42):**  That's the reason they use the title, you know the subtitle, talking plants smart insects.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:52):**  These little wasps, yes, they learn color as well. So if you have a caterpillar feeding on  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:03):**  plant at one time and it's feeding on a bud that's shaped a certain way and most of them are only  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:11):**  tender buds that in that situation or another as the plant grows further along and produces  
**[0:24:19-0:24:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:19):**  like cotton a white bloom, they not only learn the odor, if they are feeding primarily on white blooms  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:28):**  they learn to go for those colors as well as the odor or the shape. We found they can  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:36):**  learn shape. Now there's a hierarchy of those that if you had the right shape and the wrong odor  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:44):**  that would it's they actually use the odor as the primary but it's an overlay so they learn  
**[0:24:52-0:25:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:52):**  the combination of those but it is really learn all that information and make use of it. So  
**[0:25:01-0:25:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:01):**  they are very good at this. Now they also, let me point out, are nectar feeders. The adult  
**[0:25:14-0:25:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:14):**  parasitic wasps, they are free living. They don't even though they produce the young,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:23):**  they've got to lay the egg and the larval and other stages grow on the caterpillar.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:32):**  The adult wasp is free feeders and they feed on nectar. So plants like cotton produce what's  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:42):**  called extaflouro nectary and that's under the leaf. They have a little nectary source.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:49):**  When the plants produce this nectar that gives them a stronger alliance with the wasp. If they  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:58):**  can provide that food for the adult wasp as well as the source for reproduction of the young,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:06):**  they are able to support those natural enemies strong. But the wasps actually learn to locate  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:14):**  odor sources in the same way. They taste sugar water. We could do this in the lab.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:22):**  Taste sugar while they smell an odor. They learn that odor means food. You could at the same time  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:29):**  train them one odor for food and another odor for host. If they're hungry, they'll go to the one  
**[0:26:36-0:26:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:36):**  that's associated with the food. If they're well fed, they'll go to the one. So what they can do  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:44):**  is learn. Let me, I'm maybe getting a little head. Let me back up. It's an incredible system.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:52):**  They have these different repetitive needs. They have a need for food. They have a need for host.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:58):**  These repetitive needs, they're able to integrate that in a brain no bigger than a pinhead.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:05):**  And learn these different, and retrieve it and respond based on current need.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:15):**  If they're hungry, they go to the odors that they've learned associated with food. If they're  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:20):**  well fed, they go to the one with the host. So a plant actually, the other thing we saw John,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:27):**  is that if the plant is being attacked and has caterpillars feeding on them, they increase the  
**[0:27:36-0:27:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:36):**  flow of extra floral nectary. So they are competing. What it amounts to is these different  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:44):**  plants out here are competing for different bodyguards. If you have a plant that's producing  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:50):**  the food, as well as the whole state, you'll see that the wasp kind of develops an  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:58):**  affinity for that plant. So they're actually able to support the bodyguards better.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:07):**  This leads me to a question I was going to ask just a moment ago. You've already partially  
**[0:28:12-0:28:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:12):**  answered it. And that was from a practical perspective, what is the capacity of these  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:22):**  parasitic insects and particularly parasitic wasps, which we're talking about, what is their  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:26):**  capacity to provide effective control over an entire field? Particularly, I mean today we have  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:33):**  these really large fields, hundreds of acres in size. And I would almost have had the assumption  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:40):**  prior to what you described a moment ago that there would be a pronounced edge effect where  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:44):**  these parasitic wasps might come in from weed strips and so forth along the edges and have an  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:51):**  edge effect. But it sounds from what you're describing that they may be able to cover an  
**[0:28:55-0:29:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:55):**  entire field. Yeah, they can. Now that's on the assumption that, see what the plant has these  
**[0:29:05-0:29:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:05):**  attributes. If you predict, you know that one time they bred a line of cotton that was nectarless  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:17):**  with the assumption that if you don't have the nectars because things like the moth, the pests,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:24):**  certain pests feed on the nectar too. And so with the idea that if you didn't have the nectar,  
**[0:29:31-0:29:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:31):**  you would have less things like bollworms and armyworms. But what we didn't think about  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:39):**  at that time was, well the natural enemy has this too. So you know you need that. And so yes,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:47):**  if the plant is not producing the food directly, then they've got to travel away and go get food.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:57):**  And once they get hungry, because they've got these searching parasitic wasps have got to  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:04):**  find their food once in a while and stop and feed and then go back because  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:08):**  when they get hungry for their energy, they've got to move. So  
**[0:30:14-0:30:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:14):**  understanding these attributes and what resources the wasp needs is very important. But yes, if you  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:22):**  understand that and assure and make a point to see that the plant provides all those needs,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:28):**  it can operate just within the field and they're much more efficient. That's the value of having  
**[0:30:35-0:30:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:35):**  this kind of information. It not only allows you to develop plant with maximum attributes to  
**[0:30:43-0:30:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:43):**  support the natural enemy, it also allows you to provide the right agronomic practices so those  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:55):**  attributes are maximized. For example, we found with the signaling ability, if you get too much  
**[0:31:03-0:31:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:03):**  nitrogen, you can disrupt this or certain varieties of cotton production don't produce it as well.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:12):**  And we were losing some of this in our domesticated varieties because we didn't know this attribute  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:17):**  exists. That's really intriguing because excessive applications of nitrogen are a common  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:23):**  characteristic of commercial cotton varieties. It is true. Now just to go a bit further and talk  
**[0:31:31-0:31:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:31):**  about how not only does the plant produce and the parasitic wasp learn in association with food  
**[0:31:43-0:31:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:43):**  as well as the host, it's important to understand that they mark their where they kind of  
**[0:31:54-0:32:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:54):**  carry a map within their searching area. They search a patch and they encounter a site for a  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:05):**  caterpillar host and they crawl around on the leaves or sting that caterpillar. They leave a mark  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:13):**  so that they don't come back and waste time on that again. So as they're operating, they kind of  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:20):**  map where have they been and they have trails to tell them, hey you're going back over the same  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:27):**  territory. And you know what is interesting is they recognize the difference between their mark  
**[0:32:34-0:32:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:34):**  and other wasps of the same species mark. And not only that, they recognize whether this  
**[0:32:45-0:32:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:45):**  is their mark or another female's mark and whether it's a sister mark versus  
**[0:32:54-0:33:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:54):**  not a sister. We actually did studies in situations where we would compare the  
**[0:33:04-0:33:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:04):**  response to their mark, their own mark, that of other sister females and another unrelated  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:18):**  member of the same species, con specific but not a sister. If they have  
**[0:33:25-0:33:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:25):**  a choice and have to operate only in the duplicated space, they will go  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:34):**  and operate in that space versus their own. They avoid, they recognize the difference between  
**[0:33:41-0:33:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:41):**  odors is the point. And also there's the question, what about the very first when the wasps emerge  
**[0:33:57-0:34:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:57):**  and they are completely naive, they haven't encountered, how did they know what host  
**[0:34:05-0:34:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:05):**  plant to research? And they have preferences for some plants over others that's built in.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:13):**  But also when they're coming out of the cocoon, they get certain information. They carry a  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:22):**  knowledge. It's called mother learning when they emerge within a cocoon and the host that they  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:30):**  developed in, they spin the cocoon, they weave a little bit of the frass and odor of the plant that  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:36):**  they had developed on and they emerge from that with that preference for that plant. But it's  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:45):**  not hardwired, it's learned information they get from their cocoon. So would that be some of the  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:52):**  information, the learned information that is lost when you raise insects in the laboratory?  
**[0:34:57-0:35:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:57):**  You're right on John. We actually did that demonstration and it explains some of the  
**[0:35:09-0:35:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:09):**  release of lab reared parasitic insects in attempts to use them like bio pesticides,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:19):**  mass produce them and relieve it. We were seeing situations where they just didn't respond good  
**[0:35:26-0:35:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:26):**  and that's the explanation is that if you rear these wasps on artificial hosts feeding on  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:34):**  artificial diet, they're not able to respond until, now you can train those wasps and get them  
**[0:35:42-0:35:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:42):**  but you have to provide that training and that rearing for them because if you, those wasps,  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:51):**  we actually did comparison wasps feeding from emerging from hosts feeding on artificial diet  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:58):**  versus natural plants and the natural plant was much stronger from the first because they,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:07):**  you know, you see this and it looks like it's built in but it's not, it's learned information.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:16):**  So the take-home from what you're describing in essence is that rather than thinking about these  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:22):**  predatory insects as biocontrols and purchasing them from a lab and releasing them, we really need  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:28):**  to create ecosystems on our farms that propagate them naturally and that they're naturally present.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:34):**  We came to the conclusion that we refer to it as input substitution. You're still using inputs and  
**[0:36:44-0:36:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:44):**  using natural enemies or other kinds of things as biopesticides kind of thing. Your most powerful  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:55):**  method of first choice is to use the built-in natural system. They're much more effective  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:02):**  because of a number of these types of attributes that we didn't understand. As I was saying,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:09):**  as this interaction is going on, it's built to operate together because of the feedback loops  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:21):**  and so things that we're describing. You've got the power of the whole is greater than the sum  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:29):**  of its part and you take any part of it and you try to use that as putting it together  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:35):**  by mass re-airing and releasing. It's not the same as those natural systems because all these things  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:41):**  that we don't fully understand and come together with, it's much more powerful than  
**[0:37:48-0:37:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:48):**  mass re-airing and releasing. There are certain ways you can improve on these. For example,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:59):**  in Europe, they use certain parasitic insects in greenhouses. The way they get this to operate  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:09):**  rather than mass re-airing these in laboratories, they actually, for example, deal with  
**[0:38:16-0:38:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:16):**  parasitic insects of white flies and other kind of things in the greenhouse. They  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:24):**  take donor plants and they grow the white flies in the little cages that's over. They have a system  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:32):**  where the wasp as it grows from its host on these donor plants and they place them, they emerge  
**[0:38:41-0:38:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:41):**  naturally in that greenhouse and go to the produced plants. They operate because  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:51):**  they're building it in and using these donor plants, if you see what I'm talking about,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:56):**  because that way they emerge in that system naturally and get key information that they  
**[0:39:04-0:39:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:04):**  needed to operate. You have to find a way. Nature gives us a way if we were copying nature  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:13):**  and drawing on that, but without all this information and it's so complex, the interaction,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:22):**  it's much more powerful to use the built-in system rather than trying to put it together  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:31):**  with these artificial applications. So far, you've mentioned two different  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:38):**  potential management strategies from a plant management perspective that really stand out to  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:43):**  me. One, as you mentioned, the impact of excess of nitrogen fertilization, which is so common.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:49):**  Secondly, you've mentioned the value of these extra floral nectaries. It occurs to me that  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:59):**  the sugar production of these extra floral nectaries and the volume of nectar being  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:05):**  produced is almost certainly going to be correlated to the photosynthetic potential,  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:11):**  the photosynthetic activity of these plants. This is one of the pieces that we've observed  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:16):**  that it's possible to greatly increase photosynthesis in plants when they have  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:20):**  good nutrition. And again, also when they don't have excess of nitrogen. So for those of you  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:26):**  listening, this is in our work at Advancing Eco-Agriculture, we actually have a lot of  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:33):**  success and a strong track record of greatly reducing nitrogen applications on cotton and  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:38):**  other crops by as much as 60 to 70 percent and increasing photosynthesis. So if you would like  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:43):**  to have more information about that and learn how to do that or want to work with a consultant on  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:48):**  your farm, please connect with our team at AEA and we can help guide you through that process.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:54):**  So Joe, thinking about all of this, the question that we're asking is,  
**[0:41:00-0:41:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:00):**  the question emerges, what is the potential of this knowledge? What's the potential if we apply  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:09):**  it successfully? To what degree can we reduce insecticide applications? To what degree can we  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:18):**  develop an ecosystem where we're not dependent on quote-unquote pest control products?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:23):**  We can essentially back them out. I'm satisfied to that, John, that if you have a good healthy  
**[0:41:32-0:41:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:32):**  ecosystem and that's where we need to focus. The fact that these built-in systems is the first  
**[0:41:44-0:41:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:44):**  team. Inputs and interventions must be a second team. So we  
**[0:41:54-0:42:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:54):**  provided and wrote a paper and produced, I think it was 1998, and published it in the  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:02):**  Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, after finding a number of these discoveries that  
**[0:42:11-0:42:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:11):**  we're talking about. We came to the point of view that we've got to move back to a total  
**[0:42:21-0:42:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:21):**  systems approach to pest management and agriculture production because the natural system  
**[0:42:30-0:42:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:30):**  is a powerful system and nature tells you the way to do this. We can see that the natural system  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:39):**  is a powerful system. For example, we used cotton as our model in that study and showed  
**[0:42:48-0:42:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:48):**  that if you understand that system and use it, you can essentially remove the input of pesticides  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:58):**  and a lot of things like herbicides. We showed that there are two key pieces that are important.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:05):**  One is that you need to perennialize the system. Row crop systems that are highly disruptive  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:12):**  because of clean tillage and so forth. You create this monoculture and you kind of have to redo the  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:20):**  growth curve all over every year because you're starting with a clean tillage field.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:27):**  The idea in this monoculture production system of getting rid of with tillage and other  
**[0:43:36-0:43:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:36):**  things, everything but the crop itself, all these other plants planting ditch row to ditch row  
**[0:43:45-0:43:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:45):**  is not a good system. So perennialize the system as well as understanding these  
**[0:43:54-0:44:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:54):**  quality attributes of what truly is a healthy plant. You do it right and keep copying and  
**[0:44:02-0:44:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:02):**  operating with nature. You can essentially back them out. The information  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:14):**  about a high input system, for example, that nitrogen and phosphorus, I think that you're  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:20):**  probably aware a lot of the studies that we're finding that the phosphorus and the  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:27):**  nitrogen recommendations that were provided for years was too high.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:32):**  There's a lot of good information about that recently. Yeah, they're just continuing to go up.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:38):**  There's all kind of environmental impact of that nitrogen, for example, and runoff  
**[0:44:44-0:44:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:44):**  and effect on waters and streams and rivers. For example, in cotton, particularly when we  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:54):**  were able to eradicate the bow weaver, we moved in Georgia, for example, from 20  
**[0:45:02-0:45:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:02):**  applications, 17 to 20 treatments per year of pesticides, insecticides to three or four within  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:11):**  the first three or four years. We were on the way to backing them completely out.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:18):**  But it's important to understand the power within the system. I like to compare it  
**[0:45:27-0:45:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:27):**  because people can visualize in cities to health maintenance. You know, in managing your health  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:36):**  rather than using painkillers and antibiotics and those things, your first emphasis should be on good  
**[0:45:44-0:45:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:44):**  nutrition, rest, exercise and those types of things. Then it's okay to use an input once in a  
**[0:45:54-0:46:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:54):**  while, a painkiller, but use it as the second thing very sparingly and understand this as a part of the  
**[0:46:03-0:46:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:03):**  rule of nature. Anytime you're using some intervention, whether it be a painkiller  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:11):**  and antibiotic into the natural system, it's disruptive because it can't operate as a part of  
**[0:46:18-0:46:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:18):**  that built-in system. So you need to use it sparingly and not as the first thing.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:26):**  And the same thing with any high input system interventionists, pesticides, fertilizers, and these  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:35):**  things, use inputs interventions as the second thing. Your first team is those built-in mechanisms  
**[0:46:43-0:46:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:43):**  of pest control and fertilizers and that type of thing. But first team is the built-in system.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:51):**  First team is the built-in system. I want to make sure I'm understanding clearly one of the  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:57):**  pieces you described. You mentioned that you went from 17 to 20 insecticide applications,  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:04):**  you reduced it down to three or four with the potential of going to zero, if I understood  
**[0:47:09-0:47:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:09):**  correctly. What were the mechanisms or behaviors or actions that prevented  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:18):**  going to zero on a large scale? Was it just the inclusion of nitrogen and other factors?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:25):**  Well, more than that, I think it was the fact that we had to be careful that we were  
**[0:47:31-0:47:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:31):**  very cautious to not remove it until you knew you were safe. We were getting there to remove it, but  
**[0:47:39-0:47:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:39):**  it was still not knowing enough. See, sometimes we were working with growers and situations and  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:49):**  you're careful not to recommend or say, hey, don't treat, don't do this conventional  
**[0:47:55-0:48:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:55):**  application yet until you know it's not going to get the person into problems. So some of it was  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:02):**  the lack of experience in how much you could, because a lot of times, you may have a  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:10):**  pest outbreak that was reaching what has been established as the economic threshold.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:16):**  If you waited another day or two, you may not need that application, but until you know,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:26):**  you're very careful not to recommend. Some more of it that was occurring, maybe we could have  
**[0:48:32-0:48:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:32):**  gotten by without it and we're on the way to do that. You know, it strikes me just what you just  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:39):**  said that we had these defined economic thresholds and perhaps we should wait a day or two. All of a  
**[0:48:46-0:48:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:46):**  sudden, it occurs to me that in the IPM approach, we identify economic thresholds of quote-unquote  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:55):**  pests, but we're not monitoring and not measuring in most cases the development of the parasitic  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:02):**  insects. And perhaps if we included those as a variable, we might come up with new thresholds  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:08):**  for what actually defined economic impact. Oh, you're absolutely right, John. Let me give you  
**[0:49:15-0:49:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:15):**  an example of a thing that occurred during these late 80s and 90s when a lot of this work that we  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:23):**  were doing was taking place with cotton. Some of the things that were occurring, we had outbreaks  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:30):**  of beet armyworms that had not previously been pests of cotton. And there was a little  
**[0:49:38-0:49:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:38):**  parasitic one and basically it was a result of backing out some of these pesticides that had  
**[0:49:46-0:49:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:46):**  been used earlier. It had some cases where we were seeing beet armyworms and cotton that had  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:54):**  not occurred. Well, a little parasitic wasp called Cothesia mardinin in Ventris. It's a little  
**[0:50:02-0:50:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:02):**  braconid parasitic wasp. And yeah, armyworms were occurring in little clusters. They would have egg  
**[0:50:10-0:50:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:10):**  masses and it'd be a little cluster of small caterpillars feeding on the plant. This wasp,  
**[0:50:18-0:50:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:18):**  one of the things that happened when this wasp attacked this cluster of caterpillars and they  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:25):**  completed the development, they have these little white cocoons on the leaves and the farmers could  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:30):**  see those. And it was their first experience of seeing nature at work and natural systems.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:36):**  And they would have these armyworms that looked like they were going to be a big outbreak and all  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:41):**  of a sudden you see these little white cocoons all over the field. It became a very powerful  
**[0:50:47-0:50:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:47):**  demonstration of natural control at work and it became very helpful. And what they began to see  
**[0:50:57-0:51:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:57):**  as a result when these cocoons were appearing, if you didn't left it alone, in a few days it was gone.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:05):**  The problem was no longer existing. Because of it being easy to see, it became a very strong  
**[0:51:14-0:51:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:14):**  encouragement to that nature operating. And yeah, with a little more experience and  
**[0:51:22-0:51:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:22):**  understanding these natural systems. And so it's there. Often the built-in system is there. It's just  
**[0:51:32-0:51:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:32):**  a need to pursue it more. But you have to operate with it as a whole because once you do intervene,  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:44):**  you disrupt the system. You have the primary pest and then it triggers a secondary pest and this  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:50):**  type thing. That's what we have to do. We have to work with it as a whole system.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:56):**  When you speak of primary pests and secondary pests, it actually reminds me of something that  
**[0:52:02-0:52:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:02):**  I have read about and I've observed. Is that we now have pests in cotton and in other crops,  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:10):**  or I should say insects, that are reaching much larger populations and are much bigger problems  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:17):**  than they were historically. I wondered if you have any perspective on that. Why is that?  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:22):**  What are the changes in the system that are bringing that about?  
**[0:52:28-0:52:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:28):**  You restate that question again. Well we now have insects like stink bugs that are causing  
**[0:52:37-0:52:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:37):**  major problems on cotton that aren't even described as being an issue 20 years ago.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:43):**  So what has changed? Very good point. And particularly for the stink bug. Yes,  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:48):**  what's happened in the post boll weevil area in the southeast and Georgia included is one of the  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:54):**  were I've operated. We've had stink bugs that's become a pest that was never a pest before.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:01):**  Part of it is the fact that as you were able to back these high inputs out, you get a  
**[0:53:10-0:53:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:10):**  different situation. But there also use of transgenic cotton has been used as a way of  
**[0:53:19-0:53:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:19):**  controlling things like bollworms. We actually have found and have some studies showing that  
**[0:53:28-0:53:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:28):**  when you have that transgenic cotton and you are not getting the bollworm activity  
**[0:53:38-0:53:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:38):**  even at a moderate level in the field that you had in the response of the plant to the bollworm  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:48):**  producing these signals to recruit the natural enemy that we talked about earlier.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:55):**  Actually, we have studies to show that that presence of the bollworm at a moderate level  
**[0:54:05-0:54:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:05):**  that the plant manages and suppresses with the use of its natural ally, those chemical changes  
**[0:54:14-0:54:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:14):**  actually prevented the stink bug because those chemical changes had a crossover of suppressing  
**[0:54:23-0:54:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:23):**  the stink bug. Wow. You see what I'm saying? Exactly. Wow. So essentially the presence of  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:32):**  my understanding, my interpretation of what you just said is that the presence of bollworm  
**[0:54:36-0:54:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:36):**  pressure changed the production of plant secondary metabolites to have a suppressive effect on the  
**[0:54:43-0:54:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:43):**  stink bug population. That's incredible. And see that incredible system interactions. It is a  
**[0:54:52-0:55:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:52):**  system. That's the key central point. I want to stress it really strongly is you got to work with  
**[0:55:03-0:55:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:03):**  it as a system and to understand and appreciate the fact that these built-in mechanisms are there.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:13):**  Because of all these things that we've shown that the plant has not been able to do that,  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:19):**  all these things that we've shown that the plant has an ability to signal, it has built-in ways to  
**[0:55:25-0:55:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:25):**  support its allies and to operate in conjunction with them. This powerful system gives you  
**[0:55:34-0:55:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:34):**  avenues that are far more powerful than any pesticide if you will understand them and copy  
**[0:55:43-0:55:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:43):**  that system. It's kind of like what I just described. It's like a vaccination that has more  
**[0:55:51-0:56:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:51):**  than one benefit that it's brought. You can't have any good guys till you have a few bad guys.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:02):**  You need early season a few herbivores to charge the system, to jump start it early in the season.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:11):**  It's like a vaccination and it's broader than just that one system that you may understand.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:22):**  So this is perfect. This is a perfect indictment of the word pest. These insects are not pests when  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:29):**  they are present early season and that they're actually having a positive impact on the plant  
**[0:56:34-0:56:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:34):**  and the overall ecosystem. I emphasize the fact that when you say pest, when you get what you see  
**[0:56:43-0:56:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:43):**  and interpret as a pest rather than saying what did I use to kill that pest,  
**[0:56:51-0:57:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:51):**  it's vital that we, our first question is why is that pest a pest and what's out of balance?  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:00):**  How can I correct that and bring that back into balance rather than what I use to intervene and  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:07):**  kill that pest? It's huge difference in approaching it that way.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:14):**  So a few moments ago you mentioned in passing the impact of transgenic crops but what you're  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:23):**  describing in essence is that if you have a BT cotton crop which is the vast majority of cotton  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:28):**  planted today, then you prevent this vaccination from ever occurring in the first place.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:34):**  You prevent these beneficial worms from being present which then leads to  
**[0:57:42-0:57:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:42):**  serious later infections of stink bug and perhaps other insects as well. Am I understanding that  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:48):**  correctly? Yes you are and let me stress this even further.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:53):**  Practically all cotton production in the U.S. now is BT cotton and in Georgia the boll weevil was  
**[0:58:04-0:58:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:04):**  eliminated by 1990 and from BT wasn't delivered and put in place until three to four years later.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:15):**  During that interim we had already reduced the number of pesticides from about 17 to 20 as I'm  
**[0:58:24-0:58:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:24):**  saying down to three or four. That had already occurred before BT cotton ended. We're still at  
**[0:58:32-0:58:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:32):**  three or four or five primarily because of the stink bug. So BT cotton hasn't reduced insecticide  
**[0:58:41-0:58:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:41):**  applications at all. No, not if you look at those numbers. It was already there. Now think about it.  
**[0:58:50-0:59:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:50):**  All the studies that we've done, if you look in the literature, there are two parasitic wasps that  
**[0:59:01-0:59:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:01):**  we use for our model system called micropletus, crocipedes, cardiacleis, nigra cells. Those two  
**[0:59:11-0:59:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:11):**  wasps that are probably two of the most studied parasitic natural enemies in the world through the  
**[0:59:19-0:59:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:19):**  80s and the 90s. Now with our model system and a lot of other people study, those were the  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:27):**  parasitic wasps that only attacked bollworm. The two species, the budworm and the bollworm,  
**[0:59:35-0:59:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:35):**  Heliothis zea, and Heliocoverpizae and Heliothis fluorescence. The budworm and the bollworm are  
**[0:59:43-0:59:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:43):**  the cornea worms. Now with cotton, BT cotton exclusive, we're talking about a huge acre  
**[0:59:52-1:00:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:52):**  all over the cotton bed. You have no bollworms because you have put this in and the  
**[1:00:00-1:00:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:00):**  approach to prevent resistance is like shooting for a hundred percent kill.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:10):**  Well, huge acreage. There are no bollworms out there. You can't have any good guys unless you have a few  
**[1:00:22-1:00:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:22):**  bad guys. So if you're having no bollworms, suddenly they're all removed from this huge  
**[1:00:29-1:00:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:29):**  acreage. What's happened to these two parasitic wasps? I'm sure the population of these  
**[1:00:37-1:00:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:37):**  wasps have crashed. In fact, the microfluidus crustopis is a real question. It's hard to find  
**[1:00:47-1:00:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:47):**  existence. So what is the ricochet of fact of suddenly removing? Yeah, okay, they're not a pest,  
**[1:00:58-1:01:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:58):**  but we're having to stack genes to keep this BT cotton and keep those bollworms out of there.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:09):**  What impact is having is an unknown, but we know it has to be having an incredible  
**[1:01:22-1:01:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:22):**  effect on the natural enemy system because this is not only a pest, it's also a resource for natural  
**[1:01:30-1:01:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:30):**  enemies. You have to look at the whole system and that's a great concern to me. Nobody is studying  
**[1:01:37-1:01:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:37):**  what is the other ricochets that's occurring in this system in addition to these parasitic wasps.  
**[1:01:52-1:02:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:52):**  If it's true, which the data that in a couple of those papers says that it's  
**[1:02:00-1:02:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:00):**  contributing to the outbreak of the stink bug, what else? This protein that this plant  
**[1:02:13-1:02:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:13):**  is transgenic plant to produce this toxin that is producing has to come from somewhere.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:20):**  We don't know what all is going on, but there are two guides that I always  
**[1:02:33-1:02:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:33):**  point out that you need to use. If we are going to move to a built-in  
**[1:02:41-1:02:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:41):**  natural system that we're talking about, if that's going to be our first team,  
**[1:02:45-1:02:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:45):**  then the transgenic is not. There are two components that I like to say. One is that  
**[1:02:57-1:03:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:57):**  target specific and it's on an as-need basis. Let me explain that. Those two pieces are important  
**[1:03:05-1:03:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:05):**  elements when you're dealing with managing a system. If you use parasitic wasps or natural  
**[1:03:15-1:03:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:15):**  enemies, for example, as your control system to manage pests, if you're fostering them,  
**[1:03:22-1:03:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:22):**  they have those attributes. They have what's called density dependent system. That is, if the  
**[1:03:31-1:03:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:31):**  pest gets down to a low level, they don't continue to occur. You know the old cycle of the predator  
**[1:03:41-1:03:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:41):**  and the prey and the fox and the hare. If the pest gets low, the predator backs off.  
**[1:03:53-1:04:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:53):**  If it gets high, it applies again. It's on an as-need basis. Your pesticide or in this case,  
**[1:04:06-1:04:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:06):**  BT cotton doesn't operate that way. Every plant is producing that toxin all day. The entire plant  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:15):**  everywhere, whether you need it or not, no matter how low the pest gets, you're still producing it.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:23):**  100% every plant. There's no density dependence there. The other thing is not target specific.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:31):**  Your parasitic wasps only attack that pest on those plants that need it,  
**[1:04:40-1:04:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:40):**  not all over the field. The BT cotton or like a pesticide, if you spray your field,  
**[1:04:47-1:04:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:47):**  it's not target specific. It's being expressed everywhere. Now that's why in this system that  
**[1:04:56-1:05:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:56):**  we talked about the plant calling the natural enemy, it's inducible, not constituent.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:04):**  This little signal to recruit the natural enemy that's produced in response to the  
**[1:05:09-1:05:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:09):**  damage is only induced when you have a pest feeding. If you spray a pesticide,  
**[1:05:17-1:05:24](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:17):**  it's expressed whether there's a pest there or not. It's not target specific and on an as-need  
**[1:05:24-1:05:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:24):**  basis. You see the difference? It's being expressed everywhere. That's why these things are so  
**[1:05:30-1:05:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:30):**  disruptive because they're expressed without regard to density dependence and they're not target specific.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:42):**  I think as time goes by, if we look back at our history of developing various technologies  
**[1:05:51-1:05:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:51):**  for use in agriculture ecosystems, whether those might be fertilizers or pesticides or transgenic  
**[1:05:56-1:06:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:56):**  crops, it seems practically always 20 or 30 years in the future, at some point in the future,  
**[1:06:05-1:06:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:05):**  we begin observing and discovering all of these secondary and tertiary impacts,  
**[1:06:10-1:06:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:10):**  unintended consequences that we don't know about. I'm actually reminded of an experience.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:17):**  You know, many cases, as with the case of BT cotton, it's so widely adopted that we no longer  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:25):**  observe comparisons. Where are the comparative fields or the comparison fields where there is  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:30):**  no BT cotton? How would that look different? In many cases, we don't know because we don't have  
**[1:06:37-1:06:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:37):**  those comparisons, but we did actually, we have been working with a grower who does have a comparison  
**[1:06:42-1:06:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:42):**  of BT versus non-BT cotton planted in the same field and grown together. And we observed one  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:51):**  startling difference the following season. The weed populations in the two sections of the field  
**[1:06:58-1:07:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:58):**  were completely different. The section of the field that had BT cotton had much more aggressive  
**[1:07:04-1:07:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:04):**  weed species that were much more difficult to control. Why? I have no idea. Did it change the  
**[1:07:11-1:07:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:11):**  microbial population as a result of different plant metabolites? It's just interesting that we,  
**[1:07:19-1:07:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:19):**  I guess in reality, I also can't say that it might have been just the BT because there were different  
**[1:07:25-1:07:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:25):**  varieties as well. There might've been other things going on that I don't know about. It was  
**[1:07:28-1:07:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:28):**  really interesting to observe this very pronounced and startling difference as a result of different  
**[1:07:34-1:07:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:34):**  types of plants, different varieties of plants being planted into the same soil and managed in  
**[1:07:40-1:07:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:40):**  practically identically the same way. Well, you're making a very powerful point. We know,  
**[1:07:47-1:07:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:47):**  I have, I work with a grower that I talk about in full chapter, Alton Walker. In fact, I was at  
**[1:07:56-1:08:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:56):**  Mississippi State with him and he now is a consultant and a grower in East Georgia.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:02):**  He by his own, just as a kind of a almost a hobby, he's producing several hundred acres of  
**[1:08:12-1:08:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:12):**  cotton every year and he is using, moving at a system of cover crops and input. He is  
**[1:08:21-1:08:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:21):**  trying a very strong ecological approach using these principles that we're talking about.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:27):**  Cover crops is a very important part of his work and he's convinced in his system  
**[1:08:34-1:08:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:34):**  that you do not need the BT cotton produced and also that you don't need the level of herbicides.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:41):**  Because of his production system, for the last several years, he has the highest quality dry land  
**[1:08:48-1:08:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:48):**  cotton in that area. He has won the award for the best quality. His staple length and all other  
**[1:08:58-1:09:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:58):**  attributes of the crop, not only is he producing without the use of the high input system,  
**[1:09:07-1:09:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:07):**  he's getting better quality. And why is the quality? He feels certain it's because  
**[1:09:16-1:09:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:16):**  of the quality of the soil and he doesn't need as much irrigation and dry land cotton.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:26):**  He's also now producing corn which they basically thought you could not  
**[1:09:33-1:09:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:33):**  grow corn in that area without irrigation. Well, he's able to do it when he uses this  
**[1:09:38-1:09:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:38):**  cover crop system and improving the organic quality and the residue increase in the soil.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:48):**  His moisture holding capacity is much important and much greater. I wanted to ask you about  
**[1:09:56-1:10:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:56):**  the use of cover crops as you see them from your perspective. You mentioned a little bit ago the  
**[1:10:02-1:10:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:02):**  importance of developing perennialized systems rather than annualized systems. And you also  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:09):**  mentioned not disturbing soil and not disrupting and having clean fields, etc. And I also think  
**[1:10:16-1:10:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:16):**  about cotton and some of these plants have extra floral nectaries, but there are also many different  
**[1:10:22-1:10:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:22):**  crops that don't have extra floral nectaries. What is the value of using cover crops to provide  
**[1:10:29-1:10:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:29):**  a nectar source for wasps during the production season? That can be if you have a crop that  
**[1:10:36-1:10:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:36):**  doesn't have that nectar source. You know that extra floral nectary and things on cotton,  
**[1:10:42-1:10:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:42):**  every plant's got it and it's a huge because we were quite impressed with the fact that if you  
**[1:10:48-1:10:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:48):**  begin to get damage, we showed that the plant actually increases the extra floral nectary flow.  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:56):**  And we also have studied these little wasps and showed that once they feed on the plant,  
**[1:11:02-1:11:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:02):**  that extra floral nectary, they develop a preference for that plant. We got to realize  
**[1:11:12-1:11:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:12):**  different plants are competing for these bodyguards. And this is a powerful attribute  
**[1:11:18-1:11:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:18):**  to support. So it's beyond just some physiological benefit and it's probably got more  
**[1:11:26-1:11:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:26):**  to most rows. But in the absence of those systems, you need those alternative  
**[1:11:36-1:11:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:36):**  sources right there. They can't afford this wasp, can't afford to operate here. And when I need to  
**[1:11:44-1:11:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:44):**  go feed, travel out to the edge of the field and then come back. It's very important.  
**[1:11:50-1:11:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:50):**  And this reminds me of, I apologize, I'm forgetting the researcher's name,  
**[1:11:57-1:12:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:57):**  the research done in California on organic control of aphids on salad green crops, spinach and lettuce  
**[1:12:04-1:12:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:04):**  and so forth. And they discovered that if they plant in mixed in with the crop, sweet alyssum  
**[1:12:12-1:12:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:12):**  as a nectar source at a rate of 100 plants per acre, if my memory serves me correctly,  
**[1:12:18-1:12:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:18):**  100 plants per acre was enough to provide a nectar source for the beneficials to where they would  
**[1:12:23-1:12:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:23):**  provide complete control of the aphids. You think about that 100 plants per acre, that is going to  
**[1:12:29-1:12:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:29):**  have zero impact on yield. But it's very effective for insect control. Well, see there's several  
**[1:12:37-1:12:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:37):**  things that I think that's very important. It's important to have what they call a push  
**[1:12:43-1:12:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:43):**  and the pull. You need to provide the resources with the diversity. In general principle,  
**[1:12:51-1:12:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:51):**  a more diverse system is better. It's also important that, you see in the earlier stages of  
**[1:13:00-1:13:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:00):**  minimum till, the idea was just to put more residue in the soil. But we were overlooking the  
**[1:13:11-1:13:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:11):**  importance of this perennialized system that you're relaying natural enemies.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:17):**  Think about it, if you got a clean till field, it's nothing to occur. And the ecological growth  
**[1:13:25-1:13:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:25):**  curve occurs in that sigmoid manner. You can't get any good guys till you get some bad guys.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:35):**  You've got to begin to get populations of, and so natural enemies comes rather late after you get  
**[1:13:43-1:13:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:43):**  the pests present. And you this real steep growth period that occurs is when you get a lot of  
**[1:13:52-1:13:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:52):**  oscillations and sometimes you pest outbreaks before you get to equilibrium. And so you're  
**[1:13:58-1:14:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:58):**  having to do that every year. Whereas if you keep a perennialized system, you stay at the top of  
**[1:14:04-1:14:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:04):**  that curve and you maintain a balance year round and you don't have to go through that lag effect  
**[1:14:10-1:14:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:10):**  every year. Not only that, it is important that we know now that the tillage disrupts that  
**[1:14:20-1:14:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:20):**  layering effect that's important in the quality of the soil. It's rather than the disc and the heron,  
**[1:14:28-1:14:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:28):**  put that down and create that turmoil that also loses some of your carbon and so forth in the  
**[1:14:36-1:14:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:36):**  residue. So this perennialized system is a very important element. And so we've been able to move  
**[1:14:45-1:14:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:45):**  to the idea not only use the cover crops to put residue back in, but to build the diversity and  
**[1:14:55-1:15:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:55):**  the stability in the system. And many attributes to it. I really like the one phrase you used of  
**[1:15:05-1:15:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:05):**  relaying natural enemies from season to season. That's very powerful because we're now having  
**[1:15:12-1:15:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:12):**  increasingly in the regenerative agriculture space, we're having conversations about relay  
**[1:15:16-1:15:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:16):**  cropping or relay cover cropping. And I like this term of relaying natural enemies from one season  
**[1:15:22-1:15:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:22):**  to the next. I wanted to go back and also mention, I spoke about the value of sweetolism or aphid  
**[1:15:30-1:15:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:30):**  control as a nectar source. And if any of you listeners want to dig deeper on that, I actually  
**[1:15:34-1:15:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:34):**  wrote about this research in a blog post on my blog at johncamp.com if you want to go find that  
**[1:15:39-1:15:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:39):**  and dig deeper. Joe, the one question that comes to mind, you mentioned that these relationships  
**[1:15:49-1:15:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:49):**  between these parasitic wasps and these larval and herbivorous insects have been extensively  
**[1:15:55-1:16:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:55):**  studied in cotton in particular. What is the potential for this type of interaction to exist  
**[1:16:03-1:16:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:03):**  in other crops? What is the opportunity for effective insect population management  
**[1:16:13-1:16:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:13):**  in natural ecosystems or well-managed ecosystems for other crops?  
**[1:16:17-1:16:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:17):**  Well, I think the principle goes across the board. You're talking about any particular  
**[1:16:30-1:16:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:30):**  interactions? There's not any specific ones that come to mind. But we have major challenges today  
**[1:16:40-1:16:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:40):**  with armyworms, for example, in different parts of the country. But there's, I mean, obviously,  
**[1:16:46-1:16:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:46):**  there's a multitude of insects that are called pests. And we know that they only show up  
**[1:16:56-1:17:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:56):**  when we have compromised ecosystems or compromised plant health to some degree, or  
**[1:17:01-1:17:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:01):**  I should maybe rephrase that, not that they show up, but they only become severely problematic  
**[1:17:06-1:17:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:06):**  in compromised ecosystems. Yeah, well, the  
**[1:17:09-1:17:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:09):**  this system that we use as a model is strictly a model. We see it across the board. For example,  
**[1:17:21-1:17:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:21):**  we shared the Wolf Prize with John Pickett. He's done the same kind of studies that we've done,  
**[1:17:28-1:17:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:28):**  and our colleagues in the Netherlands operating with the spider mite and different mite systems.  
**[1:17:36-1:17:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:36):**  In all of these cases, the plant supporting its natural enemy in response to the  
**[1:17:47-1:17:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:47):**  herbivore is the same system. Two colleagues that we work with in cooperation  
**[1:17:57-1:18:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:57):**  in the Netherlands demonstrated this induced signaling in recruiting the natural enemy  
**[1:18:05-1:18:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:05):**  with predatory mites versus herbivore mites. It's around close to the same time that we  
**[1:18:12-1:18:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:12):**  first demonstrated it with caterpillars. And it's basically the same way. It's a damage.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:20):**  When the damage occurs, the plant detects it's under attack and begins to recruit these natural  
**[1:18:28-1:18:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:28):**  enemies. That collaboration between the herbivore and the natural enemy operated in the same way.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:36):**  And by the way, we also demonstrated that these signals that the plant releases that attracts the  
**[1:18:46-1:18:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:46):**  natural enemy occur primarily during the day when the natural enemy is active. At night, you shift  
**[1:18:54-1:19:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:54):**  to a little different blend that often is a deterrent for herbivore, like moths that over-posit  
**[1:19:05-1:19:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:05):**  at night. These systems operate in very broad mechanisms that apparently have a very  
**[1:19:17-1:19:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:17):**  long-standing presence in the evolutionary history of the plants. It's not just a recent  
**[1:19:27-1:19:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:27):**  occurrence that's come in evolutionary time. I think these same systems operate in a very  
**[1:19:37-1:19:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:37):**  similar way. I think we can apply these principles that we're talking about  
**[1:19:44-1:19:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:44):**  use of quality of soil, the plant attributes to produce support for their natural enemies, to deter  
**[1:19:56-1:20:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:56):**  pests, all of these things. But it is a web of interaction. It all has to do with quality of soil,  
**[1:20:04-1:20:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:04):**  a greater diversity, use of supporting your natural enemies, not planting high monoculture,  
**[1:20:18-1:20:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:18):**  but mixture of plants in the right combination, and basically building into the system.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:27):**  High intervention in this system, whether it include chemical pesticides and fertilizers or the  
**[1:20:34-1:20:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:34):**  plow, are interventions that we need to be very careful about. Those are second team, and it should  
**[1:20:44-1:20:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:44):**  occur sparingly and with recognizing that these can cause harm and be careful with them.  
**[1:20:52-1:21:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:52):**  Joe, this has been such a delightful conversation. You have such a wealth of experience.  
**[1:21:04-1:21:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:04):**  The question that comes to my mind is, what have we missed? What's the question that I haven't  
**[1:21:12-1:21:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:12):**  asked? What's the topic you would like to talk about that we haven't touched on? Because I'm  
**[1:21:16-1:21:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:16):**  sure there's so many different aspects of your experience that we haven't had the space to touch  
**[1:21:21-1:21:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:21):**  on yet. Well, I think we've covered the, it's just a matter of where you put the greatest emphasis,  
**[1:21:32-1:21:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:32):**  but I think the key is to is there a common denominator principle that we are talking about  
**[1:21:42-1:21:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:42):**  here that we want to leave in this a guide. I think to me it's this, that is the thing that  
**[1:21:50-1:22:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:50):**  we were saying. Do not realize that what has occurred in agriculture is that over the years  
**[1:22:05-1:22:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:05):**  that we have as we develop this industrial agriculture era of high intervention systems,  
**[1:22:17-1:22:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:17):**  we have moved to big monoculture systems, and we have in this intervention paradigm,  
**[1:22:25-1:22:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:25):**  we tend to look for what to kill the pest with rather than why is this pest a pest.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:33):**  It's very important that we change that basic paradigm. Always in nature gives you the solution  
**[1:22:42-1:22:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:42):**  if we were to look at that primarily as our first way of doing it. Why is this pest occurring?  
**[1:22:49-1:22:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:49):**  In any intervention, occasionally yes. I wouldn't tell folks never use a pesticide,  
**[1:22:57-1:23:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:57):**  but if you do use that or any intervention, be very careful with it because it doesn't  
**[1:23:05-1:23:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:05):**  fit in as a part of your feedback loop. Now I guess I would like to make one other point.  
**[1:23:14-1:23:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:14):**  It's bigger than just agriculture. What we have done is spending a great period of my time on the  
**[1:23:23-1:23:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:23):**  local city council and other things, all of this thing that's occurred in the change of our  
**[1:23:34-1:23:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:34):**  agriculture to a very highly centralized, specialized world. I do want to emphasize  
**[1:23:44-1:23:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:44):**  it's you can't separate it from our social human community elements. Not only have we lost  
**[1:23:55-1:24:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:55):**  our sense of connection to nature and the way of managing these agricultural management systems  
**[1:24:06-1:24:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:06):**  and the pests with a more ecologically landscape approach, we have lost the flavor of our local  
**[1:24:15-1:24:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:15):**  communities in these rural areas. If you drive throughout South Georgia, for example,  
**[1:24:21-1:24:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:21):**  in all these areas that were like I grew up with your crossroad grocery store and the little  
**[1:24:26-1:24:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:26):**  communities that had the butcher baker, candlestick maker, the world is made up of systems within  
**[1:24:34-1:24:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:34):**  systems and the natural process is like a stratified system rather than a highly vertical  
**[1:24:42-1:24:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:42):**  system. When you realize that the average meal that you put on your table now,  
**[1:24:51-1:25:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:51):**  the chain of custody is like 1500 miles before it gets to your table. These high centralized food  
**[1:25:01-1:25:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:01):**  systems, it's a high risk force for food security. I'm kind of drifting over there  
**[1:25:08-1:25:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:08):**  where I think is the other question. All this is interacted together and we have a  
**[1:25:14-1:25:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:14):**  major food security problem and an issue that's of concern because this same  
**[1:25:24-1:25:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:24):**  way that the high production, high input agriculture has affected the way we manage  
**[1:25:33-1:25:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:33):**  pests and cropping systems has also disrupted and has caused a loss in community  
**[1:25:47-1:25:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:47):**  at the local community level in these rural areas. The highways of the  
**[1:25:54-1:26:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:54):**  country are littered with these little areas that where you had a community crossroads that's not  
**[1:26:05-1:26:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:05):**  there anymore. I would suggest from my perspective that foundational to this loss of rural  
**[1:26:14-1:26:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:14):**  community is a loss of economic viability and reward in agriculture and in farming where margins  
**[1:26:25-1:26:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:25):**  have become really narrow and this loss of economic opportunity has also led to a loss of  
**[1:26:32-1:26:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:32):**  community in the countryside. I would suggest that's really one of the foundational  
**[1:26:37-1:26:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:37):**  the economic drivers is you achieve what you incentivize and you do not achieve what you  
**[1:26:45-1:26:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:45):**  disincentivize which is what we have done collectively as a society over the last 70 years.  
**[1:26:51-1:26:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:51):**  I think this is one of the foundational principles. I really strongly agree with what  
**[1:26:57-1:27:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:57):**  you just described but if we want to have a conversation about a regenerative agriculture  
**[1:27:02-1:27:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:02):**  we need to remember the regenerative culture part of that as well. We also need to regenerate our  
**[1:27:09-1:27:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:09):**  rural communities and to do that we need to regenerate farm profitability. That's really  
**[1:27:16-1:27:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:16):**  at the foundation and that's why I believe and what we have observed in our work at AEA  
**[1:27:22-1:27:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:22):**  is that truly regenerative farmers when the soil and plant ecosystem is functioning well  
**[1:27:28-1:27:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:28):**  and it's being managed well they quickly become the high yielding producers which means and they  
**[1:27:34-1:27:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:34):**  also have reduced inputs which means that they become the low-cost producers which means that  
**[1:27:38-1:27:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:38):**  they become the high profitability producers as well and that's really I think at the foundation  
**[1:27:43-1:27:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:43):**  of what is going to be required to regenerate our rural communities. Well yeah see it gets you  
**[1:27:49-1:27:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:49):**  off the treadmill. You absolutely I think a basic law once you start this the  
**[1:27:57-1:28:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:57):**  these high centralized monoculture interventionist approaches and you lose this built-in power  
**[1:28:09-1:28:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:09):**  through loss of diversity loss of the natural systems of you always get on a treadmill of input  
**[1:28:19-1:28:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:19):**  and that gets to the economics of it but it also this creates a centralized specialized system that  
**[1:28:30-1:28:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:30):**  it moves toward the reductionist system that may be more economic on the short term but it begins  
**[1:28:40-1:28:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:40):**  to have a diminishing benefit. You always get on a treadmill where it takes more to get the same  
**[1:28:46-1:28:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:46):**  result. Let me take just a minute to mention if you've followed ever Deming's principles  
**[1:28:53-1:29:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:53):**  well it's the same principle that I'd like to just take just a moment to apply to the agriculture  
**[1:29:02-1:29:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:02):**  management system that we're talking about. The Deming's principles that were Edward Deming put  
**[1:29:08-1:29:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:08):**  into in the production system like for example if you're producing an automobile  
**[1:29:15-1:29:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:15):**  and you have an assembly line and this system that where everybody does their little part in the way  
**[1:29:22-1:29:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:22):**  you manage control or sheer quality is to have an inspector at the end of the line to reject  
**[1:29:32-1:29:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:32):**  anything that doesn't look right and doesn't fit the system and you create a game  
**[1:29:41-1:29:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:41):**  create a game without end that is the assembly line worker operating in competition with the  
**[1:29:48-1:29:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:48):**  and they get increasingly creative about getting it past the inspector.  
**[1:29:55-1:30:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:55):**  It appears always that to control a pest or any undesired variable is to produce a force  
**[1:30:06-1:30:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:06):**  like a pesticide to treat an undesired variable or anything or an inspector to create  
**[1:30:17-1:30:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:17):**  quality. It's a game without end and rather than to create a system and  
**[1:30:26-1:30:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:26):**  basically when you have an undesired variable which basically the way he applied that into the  
**[1:30:32-1:30:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:32):**  industrial model of producing a product is say you just create these total quality work  
**[1:30:38-1:30:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:38):**  circles where if you have an undesired variable you just engineer it out. The same thing occurs  
**[1:30:45-1:30:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:45):**  into agriculture production is if you have a pest outbreak just redesign your system so  
**[1:30:53-1:30:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:53):**  the pest never becomes a pest. It's the same basic principle that we've got to operate in.  
**[1:30:59-1:31:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:59):**  Anyway, these are some basic laws that we're talking about and loss of community.  
**[1:31:14-1:31:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:14):**  What I've seen is some recent reports when this proposed solution for these things with  
**[1:31:21-1:31:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:21):**  from management at the federal level and so forth is to build more roads, more fiber optic  
**[1:31:31-1:31:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:31):**  networks into these communities and do more of the same. I just that's not going to do it.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:39):**  We've got to go back to your point that you're making to regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:31:46-1:31:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:46):**  All of that has got to start with us reconnecting to natural systems and understanding  
**[1:31:54-1:31:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:54):**  operating is a part of our natural world.  
**[1:32:00-1:32:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:00):**  Absolutely. Joe, thank you so much and friends I hope you enjoyed this conversation as much as I did.  
**[1:32:08-1:32:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:08):**  I've learned that some people are not aware that we produce show notes that goes with every one of  
**[1:32:14-1:32:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:14):**  these episodes. If you're listening on a typical podcast platform you won't have access to those  
**[1:32:22-1:32:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:22):**  show notes but if you go to the podcast website at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com then you'll

**[1:32:35-1:32:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:35):**  and we also put links in there to relevant links. We'll have links to some of Joe's work that you'll  
**[1:32:40-1:32:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:40):**  be able to see and read some of his papers and some of the references and things that we discuss

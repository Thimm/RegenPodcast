### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2022-02-24)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast where we  talk about the agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate plant health,  soil health, and public health, and of course very importantly, regenerate farm profitability  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:15):**  and the pathway to achieving all these other outcomes. I'm really excited to be having a  conversation for this episode with Joe Lewis who has been on the forefront of a lot of foundational  research on how insects communicate with their environment, with their plants, and with identifying  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:34):**  target insects. So I'm really excited to have Joe here. He has also published a new book recently  titled A New Farm Language and this is a topic that's really important to me personally because  I think we constrain ourselves a lot by the choice of words that we use. Words are powerful and if we  
**[0:00:56-0:01:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:00:56):**  constantly refer to things as pests or weeds or pathogens, then to some degree we're creating the  reality that we expect and we would be wise, I believe, to choose better words and to develop a  new lexicon and a new language. So, but Joe, the title of your book really spoke to me a lot. I  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:15):**  really appreciated it and thank you for being here today. Can you tell us a little bit about your  background and your story and what brought you to doing some of this foundational research?  Sure, John, and let me say it's a delight to be with you today. I'm looking forward to the  
**[0:01:32-0:01:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:32):**  conversation. I've seen some of your work and your broadcast and I'm excited to be a part of  it today and it's an exciting thing and we share so much of the same view and hopefully we can  have a good conversation and communicate some of those to the audience. So I look forward to it.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:01:54):**  My background, of course, I just completed an exciting career as a scientist in the field  of entomology and agriculture specifically, but after 40 plus years of academic  research and being in that field, I want to point out my earlier years were far from scholarly.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:23):**  I grew up in a very remote rural area of South Mississippi as a sharecropper's son. My father  was illiterate, couldn't read or write a single word. The earlier years of my life,  no electricity, no running water, none of the modern conveniences.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:02:44):**  And then I had the opportunity later to go through and have a good education and to be a part of the  modern technology in the world from a very different view for 40 plus years. So I've seen  the world from both sides now and let's talk a little bit, if I could, about those earlier years.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:10):**  I refer to it and I speak of it as being like Charles Dickens. It was the worst of times  and best of times. It was the worst of times. That type of life can be very rugged  and particularly from a perspective of today when we're used to our air conditioning and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:30):**  all the modern conveniences of running water and those kind of things. But it was the best of time  in that we were a part of nature. We didn't just see nature, we were of nature. When you  do not have any electric lights and those type of things, number one, you have to live as a part of  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:03:57):**  nature and hear the sounds of nature, see and feel nature. You have to do things by the light  because you don't have the convenience of electric lights and other kinds of things.  You don't have the commotions of all the commerce and you hear and see and experience nature in a  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:19):**  very, very different way. You can read and you understand the language of nature.  I think that is huge. You also see the true marvels and understand and appreciate the fact  that nature is a web. You don't see it in the reductionist view that we do at the current time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:04:44):**  As Rachel Carson said, in nature nothing exists alone and you see and experience that and you  see it's truly a system. Nature and our world is made up of systems within systems.  But in our modern world, we centralize and specialize things and you see it in parts.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:14):**  We lose so much in the power and we've become very interventionist oriented.  So I watched that occur over my life in the earlier stages as that took place.  This process of fragmentation and this mechanistic view of trying to identify and understand the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:33):**  parts, I think is based on the premise of the mistaken belief that if you understand the parts,  then you can also understand the whole. I think we're beginning to recognize that that is not the  case. You cannot understand the whole just because you recognize the parts. This is really a  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:05:50):**  challenge in our agricultural research because if anything is a description of managing an ecosystem,  it should be agriculture. Yet our agricultural science has all been fragmented to where we have  people studying very specific things rather than the whole ecosystem. Absolutely. Let me compare  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:10):**  that a little bit about kind of what I saw earlier and go back to say a couple of things of that  because of the way I grew up and saw those things. It helped me to see things different and observe  things as I got into my research. So hold that. I want to come through that and not forget it.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:29):**  But see as you grow up in true subsistence farming, the way we lived and farmed, we were  a sharecropper. We didn't own the land, so we lived on, maybe had access to maybe 50,000  acres or something like that where we had to make our living and actually grow our food.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:06:49):**  We had five acres of cotton as a cash crop. That was the only, I guess, money that we had.  Everything else, we grew our food. In that kind of living, you see the interaction of the parts.  You have chickens, you have cows, and you have your mule, and you have the cotton and  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:13):**  corn to feed the cattle and the chickens who all were free-range chickens. So you  knew your connection to the land. You had the cows, you milked them, you had the churn of butter,  all those things all the way back to the land. You understood those connections and the interactions  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:07:35):**  of the part. You also saw things like if you had marten houses and so forth to see them to  chase the hawks and to protect the chickens. You saw all the interactions.  For a child with a robust curiosity, which I have, you're exploring and you see the adventures,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:02):**  the beauty, and also the power within the natural world and how interactive and integrated it was.  You didn't see it in its part. Seeing the world in that way, I think it helped me in the research  not to break things in its part. We understood that even as we studied, I got into a very strong interest  
**[0:08:36-0:08:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:08:36):**  very early in my career of biological control and natural enemies of herbivores, primarily the  parasitic wasp. That became the primary subject of my study. I could see when you took  those little parasitic wasps out of nature and start producing them and left, once you  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:00):**  unplug them from that natural system, you didn't have the same organism. It was very different.  So that gets at the point that you were making. I think it helped to understand  the world is an integrated system and to get the best of the research and to understand  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:27):**  natural systems, you have to study it in its whole. That's the way we did our research.  So tell us a little bit about the research. I mentioned briefly that you were a pioneer or  an early group of researchers looking at developing biological controls and  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:09:48):**  kind of practical entomology from an agricultural perspective. Tell us about what brought you there  and what got started. Well, as I was saying, I got developed interest real early just from  looking at insects and agriculture and particularly production of cotton and corn and row crops in the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:10):**  south. I developed a strong interest in the natural enemies and particularly the model  that we can discuss a bit here that we use were the parasitic wasps.  What we recognized, if we were going to use biological control and to remove away from so  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:32):**  much emphasis on pesticides and interventions and capture the natural power built within,  these were very important things. The key to their reliability and successful implementation  was how does a female parasitic wasp find those herbivores.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:10:57):**  That became the key point of our study very early because you think about it.  Here you have a little parasitic wasp that can develop only in a certain types of caterpillars  that's playing hide and seek with them in a huge,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:15):**  field of cotton and all the vegetative growth. How do they find those little caterpillars and  deposit an egg within them? That was the heart of this. As we begin to uncover some things,  it really got exciting because one of the things that we found was the plant has attributes we had  
**[0:11:45-0:11:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:11:45):**  no idea that existed. We found in the first discovery, the first report of the fact that  plants when they're being fed on a plant, they're being fed on a plant that's not  plants when they're being fed on by a caterpillar or any other herbivore.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:09):**  They have an attribute that we did not know and that was they have the ability to begin to produce  and emit body odors like an SOS signal sending out a cry for help to their natural enemy and recruit  them to their aid. The wasp is able to locate the holes based on that signal from the plant.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:12:37):**  Had we suggested that a few years earlier, we would have been laughed out of the profession,  but it is an inducible response. We really got into working out how does this occur? What's  the mechanism by which a plant can talk and send signals to their bodyguards? We will call them the  
**[0:13:02-0:13:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:02):**  parasitic wasp. What we found is that when the caterpillar or any herbivore we later found,  all plants have this ability as we went on, but when we first discovered we were working primarily  with corn and cotton, when they wound the plant, they start munching on the fruit or leaf or  
**[0:13:26-0:13:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:26):**  whatever, the plant detects this feeding and begins to crank up a set of chemical factors  and produce a group of six, seven, ten compounds, a blend of body odors and emit those odors.  These are quite volatile materials. You don't see it,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:13:58):**  but the wasp can see it. It's kind of like a smoke signal that the plant is emitting to recruit them.  Now what we found using wind tones and other study methods is if you just wound the plant with say a  razor blade or somehow cut it or wound it, this doesn't happen. What happens is that there's an  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:27):**  elicitor we found in the spit of the caterpillar. If you take the spit of the caterpillar and put  on you wound it artificially and put the spit of the caterpillar, you get the same thing that  happens naturally. There's an elicitor and we are working with Jim Tomlinson who was my chemist  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:14:47):**  friend that did all this work with me. This elicitor triggers the plant to do that. So  you have to have the spit of the caterpillar. He and his group identified that chemical which was  a fatty acid. Anyway, this is the way that it's heard. Now each herbivore they do it for any feeding,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:17):**  but they produce a different blend slightly different for each herbivore.  So if you have an army worm and a bow worm, aphids, any other insect feeding on it, they're  producing these body odors for each one of these. Now because of that, it would be of low value  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:15:45):**  if the natural enemy, if the parasitic wasp couldn't recognize the difference between  these. If you see what I'm saying, then the blend is a little different and they recognize  the blend for each. Only their whole family would be able to distinguish it.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:04):**  So basically, I want to hear your comment, but just to say it is because they're sending  a little different. It's like you're going into the store and you're getting different items and  you have a barcode and the barcode is a little different for each. They are sending a different  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:26):**  signal and the parasitic can, they're talking to the wasp and they're telling them something's  feeding on it and what it is. So there it's actually truly like a language if you see what I'm saying.  Wow. So plants produce a unique signal for every pest, every insect herbivore. Just look at that.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:16:49):**  I just used the word pest again. For every insect herbivore that feeds on them, a unique one for  each one. What is the distance that this signal reaches? What's the sensitivity of these parasitic  wasps and how accurately can they perceive which plants are infected or which fields are infected?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:11):**  We know it's like parts per billion. It amounts to the fact that if you're sitting in this room  and you have a few molecules just emitted, they can pick it up. It's incredibly sensitive  and they can navigate and follow these odors in a little turbulent environment. We actually  
**[0:17:36-0:17:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:17:36):**  did those kind of studies and found that they're able to navigate those very good. So it really is  an incredible sensitive system that is certainly in the range of the same thing as the bloodhound.  We did those types of studies. Now there's another side of this, John.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:04):**  Since there's a different blend and because they're emitting these all these odors  in response to any herbivore feeding on it and they also the plant let's say you have a  the bowworm for example that's feeding on cotton. These are the cornea worm or an army worm.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:34):**  Our study was really with wasps of the bowworm. Primarily we did some with army worms too.  These are polyphagus insects as we call them. They feed on a variety of different plants.  All these plants are signaled. The signal is the same basic mechanism in the plant  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:18:58):**  but it's different on different plants. What I'm saying is they've got to follow a different  signal in cotton or corn or some early season annual that their host is feeding on.  So they can't afford to hardwire this signal. They just don't have the innate ability  
**[0:19:22-0:19:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:22):**  in a specific plant signal sent to them. So how do they respond to a different blend or a signal  variation from one plant to the next or one age of plant to the next? They can't hardwire that.  So we find they accomplish that. That's exactly it. They learn and they are incredibly good at  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:19:52):**  learning and we really work that system out. So let's talk a little bit about that learning  mechanism. What they do is the same as occurs in vertebrates. In 1988 we actually reported in nature  the first demonstration with these wasps of true associative learning with these insects.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:31](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:21):**  What happens when they encounter the site and there's the caterpillar host and they have feces  where they have fed or they touch the caterpillar they've set. There is a chemical in the feces  that actually comes from the peritropic membrane and are only insect itself, the caterpillar.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:20:47):**  We find that we didn't identify that but it's a glycoprotease, a real heavy compound chemical  that is host specific. This is hardware. This is what you call in associative learning the  unconditional cue. It's hardwired and when they touch this with their antenna they have  
**[0:21:12-0:21:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:12):**  a taste receptor and also taste receptors on these on the overposid.  They make this contact. They link whatever volatile odors are with that. So it's an associative  link. When they taste while they smell they learn this odor which is the conditioned cue.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:37):**  They learn this odor means host. It's like saying this is what the host is feeding on. This is what  they smell like in this patch of host and they start following that specific signal. They can  learn and update every time they encounter a different patch of host and know what they're  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:21:55):**  feeding on, how it smells. They then learn that plant signal for that situation. You see what  I'm saying? It's an incredibly quick. In the learning process, if you release a  have a wasp or it naturally occurs in a patch of host for about the first two or three hosts,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:18):**  they encounter it's a little slower but then they learn what's occurring in this patch and  the efficiency gets real strong through learning. So the wasp learns and the caterpillar plant  sends its signal and they are working together as allies competing and managing this sneaky  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:22:43):**  caterpillar that's caught between the two kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea.  When we think about the capacity to learn, there's the capacity to learn these various odors which is  really remarkable but plants also change in structure and shape as they grow and mature as  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:04):**  well. I would imagine that the locations where caterpillars are found on plants also change as  plants mature. We know that some larval insects focus on feeding on blossoms or  on corn silk for example or something like that. Is there also learning that goes on in regards  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:24):**  to the location of where these caterpillars might be found or these larvae might be found?  The deeper the well, the sweeter the honey. The further we get into this, the richer it gets.  Yes, not only did they learn this wasp, we're talking about smart insects.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:23:42):**  That's the reason they use the title, you know the subtitle, talking plants smart insects.  These little wasps, yes, they learn color as well. So if you have a caterpillar feeding on  plant at one time and it's feeding on a bud that's shaped a certain way and most of them are only  
**[0:24:11-0:24:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:11):**  tender buds that in that situation or another as the plant grows further along and produces  like cotton a white bloom, they not only learn the odor, if they are feeding primarily on white blooms  they learn to go for those colors as well as the odor or the shape. We found they can  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:24:36):**  learn shape. Now there's a hierarchy of those that if you had the right shape and the wrong odor  that would it's they actually use the odor as the primary but it's an overlay so they learn  the combination of those but it is really learn all that information and make use of it. So  
**[0:25:01-0:25:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:01):**  they are very good at this. Now they also, let me point out, are nectar feeders. The adult  parasitic wasps, they are free living. They don't even though they produce the young,  they've got to lay the egg and the larval and other stages grow on the caterpillar.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:32):**  The adult wasp is free feeders and they feed on nectar. So plants like cotton produce what's  called extaflouro nectary and that's under the leaf. They have a little nectary source.  When the plants produce this nectar that gives them a stronger alliance with the wasp. If they  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:25:58):**  can provide that food for the adult wasp as well as the source for reproduction of the young,  they are able to support those natural enemies strong. But the wasps actually learn to locate  odor sources in the same way. They taste sugar water. We could do this in the lab.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:22):**  Taste sugar while they smell an odor. They learn that odor means food. You could at the same time  train them one odor for food and another odor for host. If they're hungry, they'll go to the one  that's associated with the food. If they're well fed, they'll go to the one. So what they can do  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:26:44):**  is learn. Let me, I'm maybe getting a little head. Let me back up. It's an incredible system.  They have these different repetitive needs. They have a need for food. They have a need for host.  These repetitive needs, they're able to integrate that in a brain no bigger than a pinhead.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:05):**  And learn these different, and retrieve it and respond based on current need.  If they're hungry, they go to the odors that they've learned associated with food. If they're  well fed, they go to the one with the host. So a plant actually, the other thing we saw John,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:27):**  is that if the plant is being attacked and has caterpillars feeding on them, they increase the  flow of extra floral nectary. So they are competing. What it amounts to is these different  plants out here are competing for different bodyguards. If you have a plant that's producing  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:27:50):**  the food, as well as the whole state, you'll see that the wasp kind of develops an  affinity for that plant. So they're actually able to support the bodyguards better.  This leads me to a question I was going to ask just a moment ago. You've already partially  
**[0:28:12-0:28:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:12):**  answered it. And that was from a practical perspective, what is the capacity of these  parasitic insects and particularly parasitic wasps, which we're talking about, what is their  capacity to provide effective control over an entire field? Particularly, I mean today we have  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:33):**  these really large fields, hundreds of acres in size. And I would almost have had the assumption  prior to what you described a moment ago that there would be a pronounced edge effect where  these parasitic wasps might come in from weed strips and so forth along the edges and have an  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:28:51):**  edge effect. But it sounds from what you're describing that they may be able to cover an  entire field. Yeah, they can. Now that's on the assumption that, see what the plant has these  attributes. If you predict, you know that one time they bred a line of cotton that was nectarless  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:17):**  with the assumption that if you don't have the nectars because things like the moth, the pests,  certain pests feed on the nectar too. And so with the idea that if you didn't have the nectar,  you would have less things like bollworms and armyworms. But what we didn't think about  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:29:39):**  at that time was, well the natural enemy has this too. So you know you need that. And so yes,  if the plant is not producing the food directly, then they've got to travel away and go get food.  And once they get hungry, because they've got these searching parasitic wasps have got to  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:04):**  find their food once in a while and stop and feed and then go back because  when they get hungry for their energy, they've got to move. So  understanding these attributes and what resources the wasp needs is very important. But yes, if you  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:22):**  understand that and assure and make a point to see that the plant provides all those needs,  it can operate just within the field and they're much more efficient. That's the value of having  this kind of information. It not only allows you to develop plant with maximum attributes to  
**[0:30:43-0:30:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:30:43):**  support the natural enemy, it also allows you to provide the right agronomic practices so those  attributes are maximized. For example, we found with the signaling ability, if you get too much  nitrogen, you can disrupt this or certain varieties of cotton production don't produce it as well.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:12):**  And we were losing some of this in our domesticated varieties because we didn't know this attribute  exists. That's really intriguing because excessive applications of nitrogen are a common  characteristic of commercial cotton varieties. It is true. Now just to go a bit further and talk  
**[0:31:31-0:31:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:31:31):**  about how not only does the plant produce and the parasitic wasp learn in association with food  as well as the host, it's important to understand that they mark their where they kind of  carry a map within their searching area. They search a patch and they encounter a site for a  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:05):**  caterpillar host and they crawl around on the leaves or sting that caterpillar. They leave a mark  so that they don't come back and waste time on that again. So as they're operating, they kind of  map where have they been and they have trails to tell them, hey you're going back over the same  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:27):**  territory. And you know what is interesting is they recognize the difference between their mark  and other wasps of the same species mark. And not only that, they recognize whether this  is their mark or another female's mark and whether it's a sister mark versus  
**[0:32:54-0:33:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:32:54):**  not a sister. We actually did studies in situations where we would compare the  response to their mark, their own mark, that of other sister females and another unrelated  member of the same species, con specific but not a sister. If they have  
**[0:33:25-0:33:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:25):**  a choice and have to operate only in the duplicated space, they will go  and operate in that space versus their own. They avoid, they recognize the difference between  odors is the point. And also there's the question, what about the very first when the wasps emerge  
**[0:33:57-0:34:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:33:57):**  and they are completely naive, they haven't encountered, how did they know what host  plant to research? And they have preferences for some plants over others that's built in.  But also when they're coming out of the cocoon, they get certain information. They carry a  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:22):**  knowledge. It's called mother learning when they emerge within a cocoon and the host that they  developed in, they spin the cocoon, they weave a little bit of the frass and odor of the plant that  they had developed on and they emerge from that with that preference for that plant. But it's  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:34:45):**  not hardwired, it's learned information they get from their cocoon. So would that be some of the  information, the learned information that is lost when you raise insects in the laboratory?  You're right on John. We actually did that demonstration and it explains some of the  
**[0:35:09-0:35:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:09):**  release of lab reared parasitic insects in attempts to use them like bio pesticides,  mass produce them and relieve it. We were seeing situations where they just didn't respond good  and that's the explanation is that if you rear these wasps on artificial hosts feeding on  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:34):**  artificial diet, they're not able to respond until, now you can train those wasps and get them  but you have to provide that training and that rearing for them because if you, those wasps,  we actually did comparison wasps feeding from emerging from hosts feeding on artificial diet  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:35:58):**  versus natural plants and the natural plant was much stronger from the first because they,  you know, you see this and it looks like it's built in but it's not, it's learned information.  So the take-home from what you're describing in essence is that rather than thinking about these  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:22):**  predatory insects as biocontrols and purchasing them from a lab and releasing them, we really need  to create ecosystems on our farms that propagate them naturally and that they're naturally present.  We came to the conclusion that we refer to it as input substitution. You're still using inputs and  
**[0:36:44-0:36:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:36:44):**  using natural enemies or other kinds of things as biopesticides kind of thing. Your most powerful  method of first choice is to use the built-in natural system. They're much more effective  because of a number of these types of attributes that we didn't understand. As I was saying,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:09):**  as this interaction is going on, it's built to operate together because of the feedback loops  and so things that we're describing. You've got the power of the whole is greater than the sum  of its part and you take any part of it and you try to use that as putting it together  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:35):**  by mass re-airing and releasing. It's not the same as those natural systems because all these things  that we don't fully understand and come together with, it's much more powerful than  mass re-airing and releasing. There are certain ways you can improve on these. For example,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:37:59):**  in Europe, they use certain parasitic insects in greenhouses. The way they get this to operate  rather than mass re-airing these in laboratories, they actually, for example, deal with  parasitic insects of white flies and other kind of things in the greenhouse. They  
**[0:38:24-0:38:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:24):**  take donor plants and they grow the white flies in the little cages that's over. They have a system  where the wasp as it grows from its host on these donor plants and they place them, they emerge  naturally in that greenhouse and go to the produced plants. They operate because  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:38:51):**  they're building it in and using these donor plants, if you see what I'm talking about,  because that way they emerge in that system naturally and get key information that they  needed to operate. You have to find a way. Nature gives us a way if we were copying nature  
**[0:39:13-0:39:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:13):**  and drawing on that, but without all this information and it's so complex, the interaction,  it's much more powerful to use the built-in system rather than trying to put it together  with these artificial applications. So far, you've mentioned two different  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:38):**  potential management strategies from a plant management perspective that really stand out to  me. One, as you mentioned, the impact of excess of nitrogen fertilization, which is so common.  Secondly, you've mentioned the value of these extra floral nectaries. It occurs to me that  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:39:59):**  the sugar production of these extra floral nectaries and the volume of nectar being  produced is almost certainly going to be correlated to the photosynthetic potential,  the photosynthetic activity of these plants. This is one of the pieces that we've observed  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:16):**  that it's possible to greatly increase photosynthesis in plants when they have  good nutrition. And again, also when they don't have excess of nitrogen. So for those of you  listening, this is in our work at Advancing Eco-Agriculture, we actually have a lot of  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:33):**  success and a strong track record of greatly reducing nitrogen applications on cotton and  other crops by as much as 60 to 70 percent and increasing photosynthesis. So if you would like  to have more information about that and learn how to do that or want to work with a consultant on  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:40:48):**  your farm, please connect with our team at AEA and we can help guide you through that process.  So Joe, thinking about all of this, the question that we're asking is,  the question emerges, what is the potential of this knowledge? What's the potential if we apply  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:09):**  it successfully? To what degree can we reduce insecticide applications? To what degree can we  develop an ecosystem where we're not dependent on quote-unquote pest control products?  We can essentially back them out. I'm satisfied to that, John, that if you have a good healthy  
**[0:41:32-0:41:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:41:32):**  ecosystem and that's where we need to focus. The fact that these built-in systems is the first  team. Inputs and interventions must be a second team. So we  provided and wrote a paper and produced, I think it was 1998, and published it in the  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:02):**  Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, after finding a number of these discoveries that  we're talking about. We came to the point of view that we've got to move back to a total  systems approach to pest management and agriculture production because the natural system  
**[0:42:30-0:42:39](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:30):**  is a powerful system and nature tells you the way to do this. We can see that the natural system  is a powerful system. For example, we used cotton as our model in that study and showed  that if you understand that system and use it, you can essentially remove the input of pesticides  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:42:58):**  and a lot of things like herbicides. We showed that there are two key pieces that are important.  One is that you need to perennialize the system. Row crop systems that are highly disruptive  because of clean tillage and so forth. You create this monoculture and you kind of have to redo the  
**[0:43:20-0:43:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:20):**  growth curve all over every year because you're starting with a clean tillage field.  The idea in this monoculture production system of getting rid of with tillage and other  things, everything but the crop itself, all these other plants planting ditch row to ditch row  
**[0:43:45-0:43:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:43:45):**  is not a good system. So perennialize the system as well as understanding these  quality attributes of what truly is a healthy plant. You do it right and keep copying and  operating with nature. You can essentially back them out. The information  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:14):**  about a high input system, for example, that nitrogen and phosphorus, I think that you're  probably aware a lot of the studies that we're finding that the phosphorus and the  nitrogen recommendations that were provided for years was too high.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:32):**  There's a lot of good information about that recently. Yeah, they're just continuing to go up.  There's all kind of environmental impact of that nitrogen, for example, and runoff  and effect on waters and streams and rivers. For example, in cotton, particularly when we  
**[0:44:54-0:45:01](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:44:54):**  were able to eradicate the bow weaver, we moved in Georgia, for example, from 20  applications, 17 to 20 treatments per year of pesticides, insecticides to three or four within  the first three or four years. We were on the way to backing them completely out.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:27](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:18):**  But it's important to understand the power within the system. I like to compare it  because people can visualize in cities to health maintenance. You know, in managing your health  rather than using painkillers and antibiotics and those things, your first emphasis should be on good  
**[0:45:44-0:45:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:45:44):**  nutrition, rest, exercise and those types of things. Then it's okay to use an input once in a  while, a painkiller, but use it as the second thing very sparingly and understand this as a part of the  rule of nature. Anytime you're using some intervention, whether it be a painkiller  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:11):**  and antibiotic into the natural system, it's disruptive because it can't operate as a part of  that built-in system. So you need to use it sparingly and not as the first thing.  And the same thing with any high input system interventionists, pesticides, fertilizers, and these  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:35):**  things, use inputs interventions as the second thing. Your first team is those built-in mechanisms  of pest control and fertilizers and that type of thing. But first team is the built-in system.  First team is the built-in system. I want to make sure I'm understanding clearly one of the  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:46:57):**  pieces you described. You mentioned that you went from 17 to 20 insecticide applications,  you reduced it down to three or four with the potential of going to zero, if I understood  correctly. What were the mechanisms or behaviors or actions that prevented  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:18):**  going to zero on a large scale? Was it just the inclusion of nitrogen and other factors?  Well, more than that, I think it was the fact that we had to be careful that we were  very cautious to not remove it until you knew you were safe. We were getting there to remove it, but  
**[0:47:39-0:47:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:47:39):**  it was still not knowing enough. See, sometimes we were working with growers and situations and  you're careful not to recommend or say, hey, don't treat, don't do this conventional  application yet until you know it's not going to get the person into problems. So some of it was  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:02):**  the lack of experience in how much you could, because a lot of times, you may have a  pest outbreak that was reaching what has been established as the economic threshold.  If you waited another day or two, you may not need that application, but until you know,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:26):**  you're very careful not to recommend. Some more of it that was occurring, maybe we could have  gotten by without it and we're on the way to do that. You know, it strikes me just what you just  said that we had these defined economic thresholds and perhaps we should wait a day or two. All of a  
**[0:48:46-0:48:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:48:46):**  sudden, it occurs to me that in the IPM approach, we identify economic thresholds of quote-unquote  pests, but we're not monitoring and not measuring in most cases the development of the parasitic  insects. And perhaps if we included those as a variable, we might come up with new thresholds  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:08):**  for what actually defined economic impact. Oh, you're absolutely right, John. Let me give you  an example of a thing that occurred during these late 80s and 90s when a lot of this work that we  were doing was taking place with cotton. Some of the things that were occurring, we had outbreaks  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:30):**  of beet armyworms that had not previously been pests of cotton. And there was a little  parasitic one and basically it was a result of backing out some of these pesticides that had  been used earlier. It had some cases where we were seeing beet armyworms and cotton that had  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:49:54):**  not occurred. Well, a little parasitic wasp called Cothesia mardinin in Ventris. It's a little  braconid parasitic wasp. And yeah, armyworms were occurring in little clusters. They would have egg  masses and it'd be a little cluster of small caterpillars feeding on the plant. This wasp,  
**[0:50:18-0:50:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:18):**  one of the things that happened when this wasp attacked this cluster of caterpillars and they  completed the development, they have these little white cocoons on the leaves and the farmers could  see those. And it was their first experience of seeing nature at work and natural systems.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:36):**  And they would have these armyworms that looked like they were going to be a big outbreak and all  of a sudden you see these little white cocoons all over the field. It became a very powerful  demonstration of natural control at work and it became very helpful. And what they began to see  
**[0:50:57-0:51:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:50:57):**  as a result when these cocoons were appearing, if you didn't left it alone, in a few days it was gone.  The problem was no longer existing. Because of it being easy to see, it became a very strong  encouragement to that nature operating. And yeah, with a little more experience and  
**[0:51:22-0:51:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:22):**  understanding these natural systems. And so it's there. Often the built-in system is there. It's just  a need to pursue it more. But you have to operate with it as a whole because once you do intervene,  you disrupt the system. You have the primary pest and then it triggers a secondary pest and this  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:51:50):**  type thing. That's what we have to do. We have to work with it as a whole system.  When you speak of primary pests and secondary pests, it actually reminds me of something that  I have read about and I've observed. Is that we now have pests in cotton and in other crops,  
**[0:52:10-0:52:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:10):**  or I should say insects, that are reaching much larger populations and are much bigger problems  than they were historically. I wondered if you have any perspective on that. Why is that?  What are the changes in the system that are bringing that about?  
**[0:52:28-0:52:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:28):**  You restate that question again. Well we now have insects like stink bugs that are causing  major problems on cotton that aren't even described as being an issue 20 years ago.  So what has changed? Very good point. And particularly for the stink bug. Yes,  
**[0:52:48-0:52:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:52:48):**  what's happened in the post boll weevil area in the southeast and Georgia included is one of the  were I've operated. We've had stink bugs that's become a pest that was never a pest before.  Part of it is the fact that as you were able to back these high inputs out, you get a  
**[0:53:10-0:53:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:10):**  different situation. But there also use of transgenic cotton has been used as a way of  controlling things like bollworms. We actually have found and have some studies showing that  when you have that transgenic cotton and you are not getting the bollworm activity  
**[0:53:38-0:53:47](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:53:38):**  even at a moderate level in the field that you had in the response of the plant to the bollworm  producing these signals to recruit the natural enemy that we talked about earlier.  Actually, we have studies to show that that presence of the bollworm at a moderate level  
**[0:54:05-0:54:14](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:05):**  that the plant manages and suppresses with the use of its natural ally, those chemical changes  actually prevented the stink bug because those chemical changes had a crossover of suppressing  the stink bug. Wow. You see what I'm saying? Exactly. Wow. So essentially the presence of  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:32):**  my understanding, my interpretation of what you just said is that the presence of bollworm  pressure changed the production of plant secondary metabolites to have a suppressive effect on the  stink bug population. That's incredible. And see that incredible system interactions. It is a  
**[0:54:52-0:55:03](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:54:52):**  system. That's the key central point. I want to stress it really strongly is you got to work with  it as a system and to understand and appreciate the fact that these built-in mechanisms are there.  Because of all these things that we've shown that the plant has not been able to do that,  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:19):**  all these things that we've shown that the plant has an ability to signal, it has built-in ways to  support its allies and to operate in conjunction with them. This powerful system gives you  avenues that are far more powerful than any pesticide if you will understand them and copy  
**[0:55:43-0:55:51](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:55:43):**  that system. It's kind of like what I just described. It's like a vaccination that has more  than one benefit that it's brought. You can't have any good guys till you have a few bad guys.  You need early season a few herbivores to charge the system, to jump start it early in the season.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:11):**  It's like a vaccination and it's broader than just that one system that you may understand.  So this is perfect. This is a perfect indictment of the word pest. These insects are not pests when  they are present early season and that they're actually having a positive impact on the plant  
**[0:56:34-0:56:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:56:34):**  and the overall ecosystem. I emphasize the fact that when you say pest, when you get what you see  and interpret as a pest rather than saying what did I use to kill that pest,  it's vital that we, our first question is why is that pest a pest and what's out of balance?  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:00):**  How can I correct that and bring that back into balance rather than what I use to intervene and  kill that pest? It's huge difference in approaching it that way.  So a few moments ago you mentioned in passing the impact of transgenic crops but what you're  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:23):**  describing in essence is that if you have a BT cotton crop which is the vast majority of cotton  planted today, then you prevent this vaccination from ever occurring in the first place.  You prevent these beneficial worms from being present which then leads to  
**[0:57:42-0:57:48](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:57:42):**  serious later infections of stink bug and perhaps other insects as well. Am I understanding that  correctly? Yes you are and let me stress this even further.  Practically all cotton production in the U.S. now is BT cotton and in Georgia the boll weevil was  
**[0:58:04-0:58:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:04):**  eliminated by 1990 and from BT wasn't delivered and put in place until three to four years later.  During that interim we had already reduced the number of pesticides from about 17 to 20 as I'm  saying down to three or four. That had already occurred before BT cotton ended. We're still at  
**[0:58:32-0:58:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:58:32):**  three or four or five primarily because of the stink bug. So BT cotton hasn't reduced insecticide  applications at all. No, not if you look at those numbers. It was already there. Now think about it.  All the studies that we've done, if you look in the literature, there are two parasitic wasps that  
**[0:59:01-0:59:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:01):**  we use for our model system called micropletus, crocipedes, cardiacleis, nigra cells. Those two  wasps that are probably two of the most studied parasitic natural enemies in the world through the  80s and the 90s. Now with our model system and a lot of other people study, those were the  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:27):**  parasitic wasps that only attacked bollworm. The two species, the budworm and the bollworm,  Heliothis zea, and Heliocoverpizae and Heliothis fluorescence. The budworm and the bollworm are  the cornea worms. Now with cotton, BT cotton exclusive, we're talking about a huge acre  
**[0:59:52-1:00:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=0:59:52):**  all over the cotton bed. You have no bollworms because you have put this in and the  approach to prevent resistance is like shooting for a hundred percent kill.  Well, huge acreage. There are no bollworms out there. You can't have any good guys unless you have a few  
**[1:00:22-1:00:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:22):**  bad guys. So if you're having no bollworms, suddenly they're all removed from this huge  acreage. What's happened to these two parasitic wasps? I'm sure the population of these  wasps have crashed. In fact, the microfluidus crustopis is a real question. It's hard to find  
**[1:00:47-1:00:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:00:47):**  existence. So what is the ricochet of fact of suddenly removing? Yeah, okay, they're not a pest,  but we're having to stack genes to keep this BT cotton and keep those bollworms out of there.  What impact is having is an unknown, but we know it has to be having an incredible  
**[1:01:22-1:01:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:22):**  effect on the natural enemy system because this is not only a pest, it's also a resource for natural  enemies. You have to look at the whole system and that's a great concern to me. Nobody is studying  what is the other ricochets that's occurring in this system in addition to these parasitic wasps.  
**[1:01:52-1:02:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:01:52):**  If it's true, which the data that in a couple of those papers says that it's  contributing to the outbreak of the stink bug, what else? This protein that this plant  is transgenic plant to produce this toxin that is producing has to come from somewhere.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:20):**  We don't know what all is going on, but there are two guides that I always  point out that you need to use. If we are going to move to a built-in  natural system that we're talking about, if that's going to be our first team,  
**[1:02:45-1:02:55](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:02:45):**  then the transgenic is not. There are two components that I like to say. One is that  target specific and it's on an as-need basis. Let me explain that. Those two pieces are important  elements when you're dealing with managing a system. If you use parasitic wasps or natural  
**[1:03:15-1:03:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:15):**  enemies, for example, as your control system to manage pests, if you're fostering them,  they have those attributes. They have what's called density dependent system. That is, if the  pest gets down to a low level, they don't continue to occur. You know the old cycle of the predator  
**[1:03:41-1:03:52](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:03:41):**  and the prey and the fox and the hare. If the pest gets low, the predator backs off.  If it gets high, it applies again. It's on an as-need basis. Your pesticide or in this case,  BT cotton doesn't operate that way. Every plant is producing that toxin all day. The entire plant  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:15):**  everywhere, whether you need it or not, no matter how low the pest gets, you're still producing it.  100% every plant. There's no density dependence there. The other thing is not target specific.  Your parasitic wasps only attack that pest on those plants that need it,  
**[1:04:40-1:04:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:04:40):**  not all over the field. The BT cotton or like a pesticide, if you spray your field,  it's not target specific. It's being expressed everywhere. Now that's why in this system that  we talked about the plant calling the natural enemy, it's inducible, not constituent.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:04):**  This little signal to recruit the natural enemy that's produced in response to the  damage is only induced when you have a pest feeding. If you spray a pesticide,  it's expressed whether there's a pest there or not. It's not target specific and on an as-need  
**[1:05:24-1:05:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:24):**  basis. You see the difference? It's being expressed everywhere. That's why these things are so  disruptive because they're expressed without regard to density dependence and they're not target specific.  I think as time goes by, if we look back at our history of developing various technologies  
**[1:05:51-1:05:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:05:51):**  for use in agriculture ecosystems, whether those might be fertilizers or pesticides or transgenic  crops, it seems practically always 20 or 30 years in the future, at some point in the future,  we begin observing and discovering all of these secondary and tertiary impacts,  
**[1:06:10-1:06:17](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:10):**  unintended consequences that we don't know about. I'm actually reminded of an experience.  You know, many cases, as with the case of BT cotton, it's so widely adopted that we no longer  observe comparisons. Where are the comparative fields or the comparison fields where there is  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:30):**  no BT cotton? How would that look different? In many cases, we don't know because we don't have  those comparisons, but we did actually, we have been working with a grower who does have a comparison  of BT versus non-BT cotton planted in the same field and grown together. And we observed one  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:06:51):**  startling difference the following season. The weed populations in the two sections of the field  were completely different. The section of the field that had BT cotton had much more aggressive  weed species that were much more difficult to control. Why? I have no idea. Did it change the  
**[1:07:11-1:07:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:11):**  microbial population as a result of different plant metabolites? It's just interesting that we,  I guess in reality, I also can't say that it might have been just the BT because there were different  varieties as well. There might've been other things going on that I don't know about. It was  
**[1:07:28-1:07:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:28):**  really interesting to observe this very pronounced and startling difference as a result of different  types of plants, different varieties of plants being planted into the same soil and managed in  practically identically the same way. Well, you're making a very powerful point. We know,  
**[1:07:47-1:07:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:07:47):**  I have, I work with a grower that I talk about in full chapter, Alton Walker. In fact, I was at  Mississippi State with him and he now is a consultant and a grower in East Georgia.  He by his own, just as a kind of a almost a hobby, he's producing several hundred acres of  
**[1:08:12-1:08:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:12):**  cotton every year and he is using, moving at a system of cover crops and input. He is  trying a very strong ecological approach using these principles that we're talking about.  Cover crops is a very important part of his work and he's convinced in his system  
**[1:08:34-1:08:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:34):**  that you do not need the BT cotton produced and also that you don't need the level of herbicides.  Because of his production system, for the last several years, he has the highest quality dry land  cotton in that area. He has won the award for the best quality. His staple length and all other  
**[1:08:58-1:09:07](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:08:58):**  attributes of the crop, not only is he producing without the use of the high input system,  he's getting better quality. And why is the quality? He feels certain it's because  of the quality of the soil and he doesn't need as much irrigation and dry land cotton.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:26):**  He's also now producing corn which they basically thought you could not  grow corn in that area without irrigation. Well, he's able to do it when he uses this  cover crop system and improving the organic quality and the residue increase in the soil.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:09:48):**  His moisture holding capacity is much important and much greater. I wanted to ask you about  the use of cover crops as you see them from your perspective. You mentioned a little bit ago the  importance of developing perennialized systems rather than annualized systems. And you also  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:09):**  mentioned not disturbing soil and not disrupting and having clean fields, etc. And I also think  about cotton and some of these plants have extra floral nectaries, but there are also many different  crops that don't have extra floral nectaries. What is the value of using cover crops to provide  
**[1:10:29-1:10:36](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:29):**  a nectar source for wasps during the production season? That can be if you have a crop that  doesn't have that nectar source. You know that extra floral nectary and things on cotton,  every plant's got it and it's a huge because we were quite impressed with the fact that if you  
**[1:10:48-1:10:56](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:10:48):**  begin to get damage, we showed that the plant actually increases the extra floral nectary flow.  And we also have studied these little wasps and showed that once they feed on the plant,  that extra floral nectary, they develop a preference for that plant. We got to realize  
**[1:11:12-1:11:18](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:12):**  different plants are competing for these bodyguards. And this is a powerful attribute  to support. So it's beyond just some physiological benefit and it's probably got more  to most rows. But in the absence of those systems, you need those alternative  
**[1:11:36-1:11:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:36):**  sources right there. They can't afford this wasp, can't afford to operate here. And when I need to  go feed, travel out to the edge of the field and then come back. It's very important.  And this reminds me of, I apologize, I'm forgetting the researcher's name,  
**[1:11:57-1:12:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:11:57):**  the research done in California on organic control of aphids on salad green crops, spinach and lettuce  and so forth. And they discovered that if they plant in mixed in with the crop, sweet alyssum  as a nectar source at a rate of 100 plants per acre, if my memory serves me correctly,  
**[1:12:18-1:12:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:18):**  100 plants per acre was enough to provide a nectar source for the beneficials to where they would  provide complete control of the aphids. You think about that 100 plants per acre, that is going to  have zero impact on yield. But it's very effective for insect control. Well, see there's several  
**[1:12:37-1:12:43](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:12:37):**  things that I think that's very important. It's important to have what they call a push  and the pull. You need to provide the resources with the diversity. In general principle,  a more diverse system is better. It's also important that, you see in the earlier stages of  
**[1:13:00-1:13:11](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:00):**  minimum till, the idea was just to put more residue in the soil. But we were overlooking the  importance of this perennialized system that you're relaying natural enemies.  Think about it, if you got a clean till field, it's nothing to occur. And the ecological growth  
**[1:13:25-1:13:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:25):**  curve occurs in that sigmoid manner. You can't get any good guys till you get some bad guys.  You've got to begin to get populations of, and so natural enemies comes rather late after you get  the pests present. And you this real steep growth period that occurs is when you get a lot of  
**[1:13:52-1:13:58](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:13:52):**  oscillations and sometimes you pest outbreaks before you get to equilibrium. And so you're  having to do that every year. Whereas if you keep a perennialized system, you stay at the top of  that curve and you maintain a balance year round and you don't have to go through that lag effect  
**[1:14:10-1:14:19](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:10):**  every year. Not only that, it is important that we know now that the tillage disrupts that  layering effect that's important in the quality of the soil. It's rather than the disc and the heron,  put that down and create that turmoil that also loses some of your carbon and so forth in the  
**[1:14:36-1:14:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:14:36):**  residue. So this perennialized system is a very important element. And so we've been able to move  to the idea not only use the cover crops to put residue back in, but to build the diversity and  the stability in the system. And many attributes to it. I really like the one phrase you used of  
**[1:15:05-1:15:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:05):**  relaying natural enemies from season to season. That's very powerful because we're now having  increasingly in the regenerative agriculture space, we're having conversations about relay  cropping or relay cover cropping. And I like this term of relaying natural enemies from one season  
**[1:15:22-1:15:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:22):**  to the next. I wanted to go back and also mention, I spoke about the value of sweetolism or aphid  control as a nectar source. And if any of you listeners want to dig deeper on that, I actually  wrote about this research in a blog post on my blog at johncamp.com if you want to go find that  
**[1:15:39-1:15:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:15:39):**  and dig deeper. Joe, the one question that comes to mind, you mentioned that these relationships  between these parasitic wasps and these larval and herbivorous insects have been extensively  studied in cotton in particular. What is the potential for this type of interaction to exist  
**[1:16:03-1:16:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:03):**  in other crops? What is the opportunity for effective insect population management  in natural ecosystems or well-managed ecosystems for other crops?  Well, I think the principle goes across the board. You're talking about any particular  
**[1:16:30-1:16:40](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:30):**  interactions? There's not any specific ones that come to mind. But we have major challenges today  with armyworms, for example, in different parts of the country. But there's, I mean, obviously,  there's a multitude of insects that are called pests. And we know that they only show up  
**[1:16:56-1:17:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:16:56):**  when we have compromised ecosystems or compromised plant health to some degree, or  I should maybe rephrase that, not that they show up, but they only become severely problematic  in compromised ecosystems. Yeah, well, the  
**[1:17:09-1:17:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:09):**  this system that we use as a model is strictly a model. We see it across the board. For example,  we shared the Wolf Prize with John Pickett. He's done the same kind of studies that we've done,  and our colleagues in the Netherlands operating with the spider mite and different mite systems.  
**[1:17:36-1:17:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:17:36):**  In all of these cases, the plant supporting its natural enemy in response to the  herbivore is the same system. Two colleagues that we work with in cooperation  in the Netherlands demonstrated this induced signaling in recruiting the natural enemy  
**[1:18:05-1:18:12](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:05):**  with predatory mites versus herbivore mites. It's around close to the same time that we  first demonstrated it with caterpillars. And it's basically the same way. It's a damage.  When the damage occurs, the plant detects it's under attack and begins to recruit these natural  
**[1:18:28-1:18:35](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:28):**  enemies. That collaboration between the herbivore and the natural enemy operated in the same way.  And by the way, we also demonstrated that these signals that the plant releases that attracts the  natural enemy occur primarily during the day when the natural enemy is active. At night, you shift  
**[1:18:54-1:19:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:18:54):**  to a little different blend that often is a deterrent for herbivore, like moths that over-posit  at night. These systems operate in very broad mechanisms that apparently have a very  long-standing presence in the evolutionary history of the plants. It's not just a recent  
**[1:19:27-1:19:37](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:27):**  occurrence that's come in evolutionary time. I think these same systems operate in a very  similar way. I think we can apply these principles that we're talking about  use of quality of soil, the plant attributes to produce support for their natural enemies, to deter  
**[1:19:56-1:20:04](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:19:56):**  pests, all of these things. But it is a web of interaction. It all has to do with quality of soil,  a greater diversity, use of supporting your natural enemies, not planting high monoculture,  but mixture of plants in the right combination, and basically building into the system.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:27):**  High intervention in this system, whether it include chemical pesticides and fertilizers or the  plow, are interventions that we need to be very careful about. Those are second team, and it should  occur sparingly and with recognizing that these can cause harm and be careful with them.  
**[1:20:52-1:21:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:20:52):**  Joe, this has been such a delightful conversation. You have such a wealth of experience.  The question that comes to my mind is, what have we missed? What's the question that I haven't  asked? What's the topic you would like to talk about that we haven't touched on? Because I'm  
**[1:21:16-1:21:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:16):**  sure there's so many different aspects of your experience that we haven't had the space to touch  on yet. Well, I think we've covered the, it's just a matter of where you put the greatest emphasis,  but I think the key is to is there a common denominator principle that we are talking about  
**[1:21:42-1:21:50](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:21:42):**  here that we want to leave in this a guide. I think to me it's this, that is the thing that  we were saying. Do not realize that what has occurred in agriculture is that over the years  that we have as we develop this industrial agriculture era of high intervention systems,  
**[1:22:17-1:22:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:17):**  we have moved to big monoculture systems, and we have in this intervention paradigm,  we tend to look for what to kill the pest with rather than why is this pest a pest.  It's very important that we change that basic paradigm. Always in nature gives you the solution  
**[1:22:42-1:22:49](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:22:42):**  if we were to look at that primarily as our first way of doing it. Why is this pest occurring?  In any intervention, occasionally yes. I wouldn't tell folks never use a pesticide,  but if you do use that or any intervention, be very careful with it because it doesn't  
**[1:23:05-1:23:13](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:05):**  fit in as a part of your feedback loop. Now I guess I would like to make one other point.  It's bigger than just agriculture. What we have done is spending a great period of my time on the  local city council and other things, all of this thing that's occurred in the change of our  
**[1:23:34-1:23:44](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:23:34):**  agriculture to a very highly centralized, specialized world. I do want to emphasize  it's you can't separate it from our social human community elements. Not only have we lost  our sense of connection to nature and the way of managing these agricultural management systems  
**[1:24:06-1:24:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:06):**  and the pests with a more ecologically landscape approach, we have lost the flavor of our local  communities in these rural areas. If you drive throughout South Georgia, for example,  in all these areas that were like I grew up with your crossroad grocery store and the little  
**[1:24:26-1:24:34](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:26):**  communities that had the butcher baker, candlestick maker, the world is made up of systems within  systems and the natural process is like a stratified system rather than a highly vertical  system. When you realize that the average meal that you put on your table now,  
**[1:24:51-1:25:00](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:24:51):**  the chain of custody is like 1500 miles before it gets to your table. These high centralized food  systems, it's a high risk force for food security. I'm kind of drifting over there  where I think is the other question. All this is interacted together and we have a  
**[1:25:14-1:25:23](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:14):**  major food security problem and an issue that's of concern because this same  way that the high production, high input agriculture has affected the way we manage  pests and cropping systems has also disrupted and has caused a loss in community  
**[1:25:47-1:25:54](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:25:47):**  at the local community level in these rural areas. The highways of the  country are littered with these little areas that where you had a community crossroads that's not  there anymore. I would suggest from my perspective that foundational to this loss of rural  
**[1:26:14-1:26:25](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:14):**  community is a loss of economic viability and reward in agriculture and in farming where margins  have become really narrow and this loss of economic opportunity has also led to a loss of  community in the countryside. I would suggest that's really one of the foundational  
**[1:26:37-1:26:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:37):**  the economic drivers is you achieve what you incentivize and you do not achieve what you  disincentivize which is what we have done collectively as a society over the last 70 years.  I think this is one of the foundational principles. I really strongly agree with what  
**[1:26:57-1:27:02](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:26:57):**  you just described but if we want to have a conversation about a regenerative agriculture  we need to remember the regenerative culture part of that as well. We also need to regenerate our  rural communities and to do that we need to regenerate farm profitability. That's really  
**[1:27:16-1:27:22](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:16):**  at the foundation and that's why I believe and what we have observed in our work at AEA  is that truly regenerative farmers when the soil and plant ecosystem is functioning well  and it's being managed well they quickly become the high yielding producers which means and they  
**[1:27:34-1:27:38](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:34):**  also have reduced inputs which means that they become the low-cost producers which means that  they become the high profitability producers as well and that's really I think at the foundation  of what is going to be required to regenerate our rural communities. Well yeah see it gets you  
**[1:27:49-1:27:57](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:27:49):**  off the treadmill. You absolutely I think a basic law once you start this the  these high centralized monoculture interventionist approaches and you lose this built-in power  through loss of diversity loss of the natural systems of you always get on a treadmill of input  
**[1:28:19-1:28:30](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:19):**  and that gets to the economics of it but it also this creates a centralized specialized system that  it moves toward the reductionist system that may be more economic on the short term but it begins  to have a diminishing benefit. You always get on a treadmill where it takes more to get the same  
**[1:28:46-1:28:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:28:46):**  result. Let me take just a minute to mention if you've followed ever Deming's principles  well it's the same principle that I'd like to just take just a moment to apply to the agriculture  management system that we're talking about. The Deming's principles that were Edward Deming put  
**[1:29:08-1:29:15](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:08):**  into in the production system like for example if you're producing an automobile  and you have an assembly line and this system that where everybody does their little part in the way  you manage control or sheer quality is to have an inspector at the end of the line to reject  
**[1:29:32-1:29:41](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:32):**  anything that doesn't look right and doesn't fit the system and you create a game  create a game without end that is the assembly line worker operating in competition with the  and they get increasingly creative about getting it past the inspector.  
**[1:29:55-1:30:06](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:29:55):**  It appears always that to control a pest or any undesired variable is to produce a force  like a pesticide to treat an undesired variable or anything or an inspector to create  quality. It's a game without end and rather than to create a system and  
**[1:30:26-1:30:32](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:26):**  basically when you have an undesired variable which basically the way he applied that into the  industrial model of producing a product is say you just create these total quality work  circles where if you have an undesired variable you just engineer it out. The same thing occurs  
**[1:30:45-1:30:53](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:30:45):**  into agriculture production is if you have a pest outbreak just redesign your system so  the pest never becomes a pest. It's the same basic principle that we've got to operate in.  Anyway, these are some basic laws that we're talking about and loss of community.  
**[1:31:14-1:31:21](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:14):**  What I've seen is some recent reports when this proposed solution for these things with  from management at the federal level and so forth is to build more roads, more fiber optic  networks into these communities and do more of the same. I just that's not going to do it.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:46](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:31:39):**  We've got to go back to your point that you're making to regenerative agriculture.  All of that has got to start with us reconnecting to natural systems and understanding  operating is a part of our natural world.  
**[1:32:00-1:32:08](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:00):**  Absolutely. Joe, thank you so much and friends I hope you enjoyed this conversation as much as I did.  I've learned that some people are not aware that we produce show notes that goes with every one of  these episodes. If you're listening on a typical podcast platform you won't have access to those  
**[1:32:22-1:32:29](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:22):**  show notes but if you go to the podcast website at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com then you'll  be able to see all of the show notes and we also put links in there to write a podcast  and we also put links in there to relevant links. We'll have links to some of Joe's work that you'll  
**[1:32:40-1:32:45](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:40):**  be able to see and read some of his papers and some of the references and things that we discuss  in the podcast. I also welcome you to subscribe to the podcast newsletter. You'll be notified  every time we release a new episode and very importantly if you're a professional grower  
**[1:32:59-1:33:05](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:32:59):**  who believes in testing instead of guessing and you have an interest in adopting this type of  approach and methodology to your farm please connect with our team as well at advancingecoag.com  and we look forward to working with you. Joe, this conversation has been an absolute delight.  
**[1:33:16-1:33:20](http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/episode-79-joe-lewis#t=1:33:16):**  Thank you for being here with us, for sharing your wisdom and I look forward to more conversations  in the future. Thank you, John. I enjoyed it very much. It's a huge subject, isn't it?  Without end.

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 11:04:34)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kampf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:06):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:02:47):**  What are some of your most memorable moments that led you to where you are today?  
**[0:02:52-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:02:52):**  I just have fun wherever I am. There's any any particular time, then a few challenges, but  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:02):**  those help you grow and help you focus on what you really want to do and where you think you can be  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:08):**  a greater service. What was something in your research work that you puzzled over for a  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:15):**  really long time that you struggled to figure out? Well, there have been a number of them. When you  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:20):**  study soil ecology, you're looking at a black box. So the pieces to the puzzle have to come a little  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:28):**  slower than they might for some other programs or other areas. But you start working on the border,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:35):**  and then you start filling in the center. And as that puzzle builds a little better, you get a  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:42):**  little better picture of all of the dynamics that's really involved. And I think that's  
**[0:03:49-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:49):**  been the greatest challenge and the most rewarding to gain some comprehension of what that  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:59):**  black box really is doing, its dynamic nature and its critical importance  
**[0:04:05-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:05):**  in the overall production stream of things. What has been something that surprised you?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:14):**  How everything can be working at one time that seems to be contradictory.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:22):**  Can you give me an example of that? Oh, I think you have your, a lot of your nutrient  
**[0:04:28-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:28):**  relationships, where you have microorganisms that are responsible for changing valence states  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:36):**  of various minerals, so they're more available or less available. And you have those going on at the  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:43):**  same, both of those directions going in the same time, and some capacities. So it's kind of a matter  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:52):**  with manganese or iron or some of those things, how some of the secondary or what we would,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:00):**  what I would consider the more secondary functions come into play, so that all of that can  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:07):**  really take place and be manifest in a very positive manner. Even though what you might be  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:15):**  looking at or the tests that you have may not show the complete picture, you have to realize that  
**[0:05:22-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:22):**  it has to be going on in order to complete the cycle. And so it's a matter of either developing  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:31):**  the techniques or understanding how all of those organisms interact together, what the ecological  
**[0:05:39-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:39):**  niches are that make the system work. So that you have, everything isn't just one big  
**[0:05:50-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:50):**  pool that's put in there and somebody's stirring the whole thing around. You really have a community  
**[0:06:01-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:01):**  of functions that are taking place at the same time, but you don't have the same gas station at  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:09):**  every corner or a grocery store at every corner. You have each one of those different functions  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:17):**  that is taking place to end their own little scheme of things so that the overall system is  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:24):**  a very functional, very dynamic relationship relative to the plant and its needs.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:32):**  One of the pieces that you and I have discussed in the past is the challenge that we are seeing  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:38):**  today with manganese availability. One of the, I would say that as much as 80% or more, perhaps  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:46):**  even 90% or more of the crops that we work with today often come back showing inadequate levels  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:52):**  of manganese. What are the major factors that are contributing to that? Well, yeah, manganese  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:58):**  availability is a very dynamic relationship with the soil by here. Also with many of the fungi,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:06):**  so that you have organisms, your mycorrhizae and that increase uptake of manganese as well as zinc  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:13):**  and phosphorus and some of the other nutrients so that if they're not functional, you miss that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:20):**  ability to absorb and to interact with a tremendous volume of the soil where that  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:27):**  mineral might be in short supply. The other thing is that you have the bacteria especially that are  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:34):**  responsible for the valence state. You have the oxidizing group, you have the reducing groups,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:42):**  so that the plant can utilize only the reduced form of manganese, the MN2 plus farm. The MN4  
**[0:07:51-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:51):**  plus farm is not available. We see that primarily present in the soil where we have high phosphate  
**[0:08:01-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:01):**  levels or high oxidative relationships so that the manganese can be there and yet not available  
**[0:08:13-0:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:13):**  for uptake. We see it commonly with many of our pathogens because the pathogens again utilize  
**[0:08:22-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:22):**  manganese oxidation as a virulence factor. When we looked at several thousand isolates of manganese,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:30):**  we have thrombosis graminis that causes take-all on wheat from all over the world. We evaluated those  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:39):**  and we found that there is one characteristic that is common all of the virulent farms and that's  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:46):**  manganese oxidation. If it can't oxidize manganese, it will never come up with these. The same thing for rice  
**[0:08:53-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:53):**  glass, same thing for isolates of streptomyces, cabies, potato, jabs, pathogen, a number of other  
**[0:09:04-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:04):**  pathogens so that just the ability to oxidize manganese to a non-available farm can compromise  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:12):**  the resistance of the plant to those pathogens and if the pathogens can't bring about that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:20):**  compromising of the availability of manganese by converting it to an oxidized farm from a reduced farm,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:28):**  the fungus is essentially just a good sacrifice in the soil and same thing with many bacteria.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:36):**  So we see these direct effects on mineral availability as being involved in not just  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:46):**  growth and quality and nutrient density but also in susceptibility or resistance to disease.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:54):**  You have the virulence relationship of the pathogens, bacteria and fungi in the soil  
**[0:10:03-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:03):**  related to those minerals that are necessary for the plant's defenses and you also see it then  
**[0:10:12-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:12):**  those minerals directly related to growth and resistance of the plant to those pathogens and  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:21):**  its overall physiological function. So it all fits together very nicely if the system is balanced,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:29):**  if it's favorable and that's one of the things that we tend to forget is that when we're farming  
**[0:10:37-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:37):**  we're really managing an ecology. It's not a matter of just this silver bullet for this problem  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:46):**  or silver bullet or stinger missile for another one. It's really a matter of having that  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:55):**  ecology work for us and support the plant. If we don't do that and we upset that system  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:03):**  then we compromise the overall quality and productivity potential that we have in our soil.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:12):**  I'd like to go back for a moment and just clarify one of the points that you were discussing.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:18):**  You said that there are a number of pathogens that are dependent on manganese oxidation  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:24):**  and if they're unable to oxidize manganese they just become saprophytes in the soil profile.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:30):**  Does that, are they dependent on that manganese oxidation directly or as in they personally  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:37):**  require it or are they just producing a manganese deficient plant that is now susceptible to  
**[0:11:43-0:11:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:43):**  invasion? Both of those statements could be correct. They don't necessarily need the oxidation.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:53):**  Many of them are also or some of them are also reducing organisms. In other words you  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:59):**  change the environment or you change the association that they have with other organisms  
**[0:12:05-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:05):**  and they may be strong reducing versus strong oxidizing organisms. We see that especially with  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:16):**  the pseudomonads and a number of other organisms where you change the soil environment and they  
**[0:12:23-0:12:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:23):**  can either benefit you or be a synergist or even a direct pathogen involved in that by  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:33):**  compromising that resistance. The microorganisms use those minerals just like the plant does  
**[0:12:41-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:41):**  or just like we do. Our metallon nutrients are strong transition elements or electron transfer  
**[0:12:50-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:50):**  and physiological processes. They're the key factor, the cofactors for our enzyme function.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:59):**  It doesn't require very much of them but if you don't have that specific cofactor that's involved  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:06):**  for an enzyme, that enzyme isn't going to do any work for you. Just another protein that's  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:13):**  sitting there and about 80% of our proteins in plants are what we call metalloproteins.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:20):**  Well the metallopart is the cofactor. It's a very small part but a very critical part as far as  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:27):**  function of that physiological pathway. In essence what you're describing is that as long as plants  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:34):**  have adequate availability of reduced manganese you have resistance to all the diseases that you  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:40):**  described. It would be very critical for that resistance for the physiological functions in the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:46):**  plant without those minerals. One of the pieces that you and I have discussed in the past is the  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:54):**  populations of some strains of verticillium in the soil profile when you have a crop that is  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:00):**  infected versus a crop that is not infected. How do populations change when you have a crop  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:06):**  infection for some of these pathogens? Well the plant is providing nutrients and resources  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:12):**  for the pathogen. When it comes to verticillium, verticillium is a common soil and  
**[0:14:20-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:20):**  habiting organism rather than just the soil colonizing organism. If it's soil and habiting  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:29):**  it's able to survive in the soil on its own. It really doesn't need the plant necessarily  
**[0:14:35-0:14:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:35):**  to continue its life cycle in the soil. A soil inhabitant or a soil colonizer is an organism  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:44):**  that as long as there is a host there that provides that nutrient base for it can be very  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:52):**  serious or have a very high population. You'll see most of your Penicillium and Aspergillus species  
**[0:15:00-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:00):**  that you always isolate in very high populations but they're only associated with high organic  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:09):**  matter and those materials that provide a rich nutrient base for them. If you take the organic  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:16):**  matter out of the pitcher, the nutrient base they aren't able to survive very well. Compare that  
**[0:15:25-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:25):**  with mucus or Fusarium or Izactonia, Pomatomyces and your regular soil-borne pathogens,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:35):**  Phytophthora, you'll find that those are going to be in the soil at a similar population regardless  
**[0:15:43-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:43):**  of what you have from a nutrient base as far as whether the plants there are not.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:52):**  Population of Fusarium may bounce around when you add the plant because you're  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:00):**  providing an additional nutrient source for it but its population is high enough  
**[0:16:06-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:06):**  in almost all situations to cause extreme disease. Even in the absence of the host plant  
**[0:16:16-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:16):**  you can have a 100% infection if you inoculate sterile soil for instance where if the difference  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:26):**  is where you have a lot of other organisms that will suppress that virulence relationship that  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:34):**  the pathogen has and it is maintained either in a dormant state or it's with some of the fungi,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:43):**  some of the fungi we refer to that as fungistasis, are a dormant state just because you have  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:50):**  an intimate association with bacteria or other organisms in association with that fungus  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:59):**  that prevented pathogenicity. It may be those other organisms may be utilizing the extracellular  
**[0:17:06-0:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:06):**  enzymes that would oxidize manganese or perform other functions that reduces virulence but they  
**[0:17:14-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:14):**  don't necessarily reduce the population of the pathogen below a level that would cause  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:22):**  extreme disease. It's just that they change its ability to cause disease so that it's more  
**[0:17:28-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:28):**  like a fat-refied than it is a strong pathogen. That's absolutely fascinating that we can have  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:37):**  these soil inhabiting pathogens that are present in populations that obviously these populations  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:44):**  can shift but it's intriguing to me that essentially what you're describing is an  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:50):**  infection is not the result of the presence of the pathogen, it's the result of the level of plant  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:57):**  health and the result of the microbial ecology in the rhizosphere, essentially what you're describing.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:02):**  That's correct for the soil-borne pathogens. When it comes to the soil inhabiting  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:10):**  then they're dependent on that both very definitely for a nutrient base and for  
**[0:18:18-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:18):**  a disease relationship. With the soil inhabiting we see a dramatic effect of crop rotation  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:29):**  linked between susceptible crops and those things. We can see it also with the soil, we see that  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:36):**  relationship with the soil inhabiting not because of presence or absence of the pathogen but  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:43):**  by the specific interrelationships that we have with different organisms with the pathogen,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:50):**  with the soil colonizing where they can, an organism can colonize as long as there's a  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:58):**  nutrient source part or organic materials part to get that nutrient source from.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:05):**  Those are more direct effects of where you see population dynamics and the typical  
**[0:19:13-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:13):**  epidemiological programs or processes going on in the soil where with the actual soil colonizers  
**[0:19:23-0:19:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:23):**  you see the interaction of other organisms in that disease suppression. I think an example of  
**[0:19:32-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:32):**  the soil inhabitant versus a soil colonizer would be a fusarium Rhizoctonia,  
**[0:19:46-0:20:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:46):**  Verstilium, those organisms, the soil organisms that would respond to population dynamics  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:00):**  would be your nematodes for one but also things like anthracnose or other organisms that once  
**[0:20:10-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:10):**  the nutrient source, the host's residue is decomposed and pretty much gone the pathogen  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:18):**  isn't able to survive in the soil against the tremendous biological buffering and interactions  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:25):**  that take place in a normal soil. What are the tools that growers have available to them to  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:34):**  manage soil ecology most effectively and to develop a disease suppressive soil profile?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:40):**  What are the most effective management strategies for managing soil ecology?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:43):**  Well from a dynamic standpoint crop rotation has the greatest effect. Again that's going  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:50):**  to depend on the particular pathogen that's involved but each crop manages or influences  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:59):**  a certain group of organisms in the soil and those then are going to enter into that relationship.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:06):**  So what we found with alfalfa when it was introduced as a crop it was a total failure for  
**[0:21:13-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:13):**  us for about two years until we recognized the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:21):**  we started adding the human oculents then in order to have that free nitrogen that made an economic  
**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:29):**  crop for us. Without that we were having to add nitrogen and another mineral but with that  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:38):**  symbiotic relationship we get for nothing or we get for free essentially by having those  
**[0:21:45-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:45):**  organisms fix atmospheric nitrogen into amino acids for the plant to utilize. So that would be  
**[0:21:54-0:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:54):**  an example of that symbiotic relationship just from a nutrient standpoint. But crop rotation  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:02):**  will influence each group of organisms so that it makes it very easy if we're developing  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:10):**  a desert soil to build up disease suppressiveness and we can do that strictly by the crop sequence  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:18):**  that we have to build a biological buffering capacity in the soil in a desert condition  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:26):**  because those soils have very low microbial population and activity to start with because  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:33):**  of the lack of water. When you get a cultivated soil it becomes much more difficult to shift that  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:41):**  biology in the direction that you want and for some pathogens we've never been able to  
**[0:22:48-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:48):**  find a crop rotation that will do that but for most of them we can modify the diseases  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:56):**  expression even independent of population of the pathogen by favoring certain other groups of  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:04):**  organisms in that relationship. But crop rotation would be the first probably the most dynamic  
**[0:23:12-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:12):**  effect then on the soil population. We can do that either primarily through crop sequencing  
**[0:23:21-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:21):**  you'll find that the immediately preceding crop to your target crop that you're working on  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:30):**  is going to have about 85% of the overall disease effect on it.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:38):**  We can accomplish that with cover cropping. You don't necessarily have to  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:44):**  eliminate your economic crop with cover cropping. We can do much the same type of thing as well as  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:51):**  get some additional synergy from a nutrient standpoint. When you look at how to manage  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:59):**  that soil we're looking at the influence of root exudates and the influence of a particular  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:05):**  crop, what it leaves in the soil, how it influences nutrients that then are available to the pathogen  
**[0:24:13-0:24:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:13):**  also are the other saprophytic organisms that would influence that soil ecology.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:22):**  Certainly tillage has a very dynamic effect. Time of tillage is very important especially in the  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:32):**  temperate climates. A little different in the tropical and arctic environments but  
**[0:24:39-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:39):**  arctic and temperate, your tillage has a time of tillage becomes very important because  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:48):**  what you're doing is disrupting an ecology that's established in a no-till situation  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:54):**  and you're trying to activate or suppress different organisms that have established  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:02):**  a king of the hill relationship with the system that you have.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:09):**  Tillage changes that overall ecology by getting some air into the soil, getting nutrient distribution  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:19):**  and stirring up those organisms that some of them are kind of like we are. If they don't have a burr  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:25):**  under their saddle they don't do much work for us and so you're stirring them up. In the temperate  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:34):**  environment where we have winter seasons and summer seasons and whatnot, you'll find that  
**[0:25:42-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:42):**  with fall tillage after your crop, if you'll do the tillage then you'll see a more pronounced  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:51):**  or a more dynamic relationship than you'll see with the spring tillage. In fall tillage you  
**[0:25:57-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:57):**  open up the soil, it becomes very oxidative for organisms to have that fresh charge of breath  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:06):**  and then over winter you re-establish those ecological niches so that your anaerobic  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:13):**  functions can take place and still have your aerobic functions taking place. So your reduction  
**[0:26:22-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:22):**  of nutrient farm or your oxidation of nutrient farm. Then our rebalance in the spring when we do  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:32):**  a lot of tillage, you don't have time during that immediately or crop that immediately follows your  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:41):**  tillage operation. There's not time to re-establish a lot of those ecological niches that take some  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:48):**  time and so you get a different effect and it can be a more negative effect, it may be a more  
**[0:26:56-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:56):**  positive effect again depending on your crop and your overall disease organism or overall nutrient  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:04):**  status that you're dealing with in a particular soil whether it's a clay or clay loam or silt loam  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:11):**  soil versus the sandy loam soil. You see those ecological relationships shifting or changing  
**[0:27:18-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:18):**  in a dynamic relationship relative to time. Moisture becomes a very important factor for  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:27):**  changing those ecological relationships and pretty much anything we do management wise  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:35):**  is going to influence that soil ecology. That's why farming we're really managing an ecology  
**[0:27:42-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:42):**  and by learning what your soil is, what your biology is, you can pretty much control most  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:52):**  of our diseases through that management activity unless you're doing something that is very  
**[0:27:58-0:28:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:58):**  detrimental or has long-term effects on biology. That's a very impressive statement. We can manage  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:08):**  disease and pathogenicity based on how we manage our soils from a cultural perspective. That's  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:14):**  a very important perspective that I think we don't commonly hear in agriculture. You  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:21):**  mentioned a number of different pieces, a number of different management tools, cultural management  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:25):**  tools, crop rotations, using cover crops, tillage, the impact of moisture and I wanted to clarify  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:33):**  earlier you spoke of the differences between soil borne pathogens and soil inhabiting pathogens.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:39):**  I believe it's fairly well understood that we can use crop rotations and so forth to manage  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:46):**  soil inhabiting pathogens. Are you suggesting that it's also possible to use these tools to manage  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:54):**  and suppress soil inhabiting or excuse me soil borne pathogens? Oh very definitely.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:01):**  Most of our soil borne pathogens we have very limited genetic resistance as far as  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:09):**  a full resistance. We rely on those management techniques to control those pathogens. Sometimes  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:17):**  we don't recognize it as much as we need to but soil borne pathogens have much more limited  
**[0:29:25-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:25):**  relationship as far as the population dynamics. We may measure population of spore load and other  
**[0:29:34-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:34):**  things for organisms like Fusarium but the population, the organism is there in plenty  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:44):**  and a high enough population that regardless of what we do, if we didn't have the other organisms  
**[0:29:52-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:52):**  associated with it, it would take our crop. What we do with our soil colonizing is that they  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:01):**  colonize only as long as they have a nutrient base to function with so that we can either extend our  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:09):**  the time between susceptible crops as we do typically with most of our potato pathogens  
**[0:30:15-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:15):**  for instance that we would see them building up in two or three crops and would want to break that  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:25):**  drop population down. Same thing with anthracnose on corn that it's a soil colonizer cephalosporium  
**[0:30:33-0:30:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:33):**  on wheat. All of those organisms survive in the residue. Many of them even produced an antibiotic  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:44):**  so that they slow down residue degradation to extend their lifetime in the soil  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:51):**  and that so that other organisms aren't able to colonize that food base which is quite different  
**[0:30:58-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:30:58):**  from Rhizoctonia or Fusarium. Many of the bacilliomycetite pathogens are very excellent  
**[0:31:07-0:31:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:07):**  soil inhabitants. They don't require the base of nutrients that many of our  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:19):**  many of our just colonizers do.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:24):**  You spoke briefly about the use of crop rotations and that 85% of the effect from a  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:32):**  in terms of disease suppression happens from the prior crop or the prior cover crop.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:36):**  What are some particularly useful crops or cover crops that have a very strong disease  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:42):**  suppressive effect?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:43):**  Again that's going to depend on your disease and your overall soil biology but you'll find  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:50):**  for instance if you're dealing with take all, you'll minimize these contaminants, the root  
**[0:31:56-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:31:56):**  and crown rot of the cereal crops, you'll find that your brassica species have a suppressive  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:06):**  effect. Perhaps the best crop overall is oats, another cereal crop but with oats we bred  
**[0:32:13-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:13):**  into those when we bred crown rust resistance it also gave us an oak crop that provided  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:23):**  disease control for take all control for wheat and barley. The reason is that  
**[0:32:29-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:29):**  crown rust resistant oats also produce a glycosyanide root exudate that suppresses the  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:39):**  manganese oxidizing organisms. When you suppress the manganese oxidizing organisms, it also  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:47):**  suppresses the manganese oxidation by the pathogen that is required for virulence.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:32:53):**  So you've increased the manganese availability for the plant for its own resistance and the  
**[0:33:02-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:02):**  shikimate pathway is the pathway that gives the tolerance or resistance to take all because  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:10):**  that's where the lignitubers are farmed, your lignification, your callusing and all of those  
**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:16):**  materials are through the shikimate pathway and manganese a very critical component in that  
**[0:33:24-0:33:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:24):**  pathway at six or seven different steps in the pathway if you inhibit the availability of  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:32):**  manganese, have a good strong key later, mineral key later that ties up manganese, you're going  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:39):**  to increase take all because you reduce the availability of functional availability of  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:47):**  manganese for the plant in its own defenses. I have a plant like rye, very efficient in manganese  
**[0:33:55-0:34:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:33:55):**  and your other micronutrient uptake. Rye takes care of itself so that it's quite resistant to  
**[0:34:02-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:02):**  the take-all pathogen but it doesn't do anything for a subsequent crop, it barely does very well  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:11):**  with very little disease pressure because it's very efficient in taking up manganese and other  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:18):**  micronutrients. If you have triticale which is a wheat rye cross, if it doesn't contain that sharp  
**[0:34:26-0:34:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:26):**  section of the rye chromosome that is responsible for micronutrient uptake then the triticale will  
**[0:34:33-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:33):**  be as susceptible to take-all as the wheat crop that parity. So that it goes that way but it  
**[0:34:42-0:34:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:42):**  doesn't, you don't get a crop benefit or a crop rotation benefit out of the oats or out of the  
**[0:34:51-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:34:51):**  rye like you get out of oats. With oats, with the root exudate that is a very strong antimicrobial  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:00):**  compound against the manganese oxidizing organisms that make manganese less available,  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:07):**  you'll see that effect and that change in the soil biology carry on for two or three wheat crops  
**[0:35:14-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:14):**  after an oat crop that will have very limited, very little take-all. Probably the most dynamic  
**[0:35:21-0:35:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:21):**  effect then you get into the brassica species, your canola and some of those mustard also that  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:29):**  produce your quinolates and some of those materials that have a similar effect to the  
**[0:35:35-0:35:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:35):**  glycoprotein that the oats would have and so you'll see reduced take-all following canola  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:44):**  and you'll see an increase in some of the other diseases when that happens. So it's not just  
**[0:35:50-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:50):**  influencing one particular disease but especially with canola if you're using a round-up ready  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:35:59):**  canola, genetically engineered canola where you're adding a very strong mineral chelator  
**[0:36:05-0:36:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:05):**  and that's how glyphosate works is by tying up those minerals in the physiology of the plant.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:13):**  But if you're adding or if you're growing canola, round-up ready canola and applying the glyphosate  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:21):**  to that, going to move down into the out of the root exudates and change that soil biology,  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:28):**  then you may see a reduction in take-all but you see a very dramatic increase in Fusarium root  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:35):**  rock as well as Fusarium head scab and the toxins that your plant pathogens produce. So you're  
**[0:36:43-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:43):**  changing the dynamics of the system or the particular management tools that you might be using.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:51):**  When you speak of the disease suppressive effects of oats and brassicas, what are the key  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:58):**  characteristics that they share in common that perhaps are also shared by other disease suppressive  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:04):**  crops? And I'm asking this question just I think it would be wonderful for our listeners to have  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:10):**  an idea of what are the various crop types or what are the characteristics that they can use  
**[0:37:14-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:14):**  to help develop a disease suppressive soil? Many of those are worked out and you know just from  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:23):**  empirical information but it all boils down pretty much to nutrition one way or another. It may be  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:30):**  indirect through that antibiotic effect through the root exudate on a particular group of organisms  
**[0:37:37-0:37:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:37):**  or it may be a direct effect on increasing the availability of a specific nutrient. I mentioned  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:45):**  the take-all situation with manganese, you'll see the same relationship of manganese with  
**[0:37:51-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:51):**  potato scab and with verticillium wilt. A little different involvement in the physiology with  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:58):**  verticillium wilt where you have a vascular pathogen versus a cortical pathogen but it's again  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:06):**  the availability of that nutrient or the non-availability that determines what the  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:12):**  disease severity really is. We're concerned in bananas for the loss of the cavendish banana  
**[0:38:18-0:38:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:18):**  because of a resurgence in Panama disease, cusarium cubans and yet that pathogen has always been  
**[0:38:27-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:27):**  there. What we've done is change the management and the soil ecology then that provide an  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:36):**  opportunity for that pathogen to become more virulent and to manifest itself. We've changed  
**[0:38:42-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:42):**  it from a saprophytic organism essentially into a very virulent pathogen and haven't recognized  
**[0:38:50-0:39:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:50):**  what those changes are usually that are involved in that shift. This situation with the cavendish,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:00):**  you have a tie-up of zinc and again the involvement of very strong mineral chelators  
**[0:39:06-0:39:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:06):**  that we're using in our chemical agriculture. You spoke of the effects of tillage on developing  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:14):**  different microbial profiles and I wanted to clarify that. Are you suggesting that with all  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:23):**  tillage applications that we get a rebalancing effect of both reducing organisms as well as  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:30):**  oxidizing organisms? We do and it depends. It doesn't have to be every year but there's some  
**[0:39:37-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:37):**  changes that take place with long-term no-till that reduce the efficiency of the ecology.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:46):**  For nitrogen especially, you'll have over 10 full greater nitrogen reduction denitrification  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:57):**  and no-till than you have in a conventional tillage. Even though in conventional tillage we  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:03):**  would have more oxidative environment, you'd think it'd be the opposite but it isn't because  
**[0:40:10-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:10):**  denitrification is an anaerobic process and so if there's any way for that nitrogen to be converted  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:19):**  nitrate nitrogen in a no-till situation that's going to be very rapidly converted to  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:26):**  elemental nitrogen and move back into the air. You'll see all your nitrogen  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:31):**  like nitro-toxides and those materials then that are evolved from no-till much more extensively  
**[0:40:38-0:40:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:38):**  than they are from a conventional. So it's a balancing situation and managing any ecology.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:45):**  And there are several studies that have shown with long-term tillage conservation tillage and  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:52):**  some of those things but or you haven't had any real soil disruption for eight or ten years that  
**[0:40:59-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:59):**  just a single shanking through the soil will increase soybean yields 50%. You don't have to  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:07):**  do that every year, you don't have to beat your soil to death in order to get those effects.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:14):**  It's a matter of getting enough shift in that soil biology, enough activity, and that we get  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:23):**  the desired result from a nutrient standpoint. What are the impacts of nitrogen and nitrogen  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:29):**  applications on developing disease-suppressive soils? Most of your soil organisms are hungry for  
**[0:41:35-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:35):**  two things. One of them is going to be nitrogen, the other one is going to be carbon. But when you  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:42):**  change either of those nutrients you'll see a tremendous stimulation of a lot of organisms  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:49):**  in the soil. Depending on what your source of nitrogen is, you get down into Florida and they're  
**[0:41:57-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:57):**  one of their primary pathogens on a lot of their crops, vegetable crops, is Fusarium  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:04):**  autismim. So if this is a vascular Fusarium, they can get pretty much complete practical control by  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:12):**  using nitrate, nitrogen, and calcium. So if they can stimulate nitrification or if they apply  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:18):**  nitrate, nitrogen, calcium nitrate or calcium nitrate, and also have to use some liming to get  
**[0:42:26-0:42:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:26):**  their pH up so that you have that nitrogen held in the nitrogen form, you have a fairly effective  
**[0:42:35-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:35):**  control of Fusarium wilt diseases. If you are looking at tobacco where we would use fumigation  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:46):**  for control of some of the soil borne diseases, you should have at least 30% of your nitrogen  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:53):**  is nitrate and nitrogen. If you don't, the plant is taking up all ammonium nitrogen, you can get  
**[0:43:00-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:00):**  into a carbon deficit because the plant will detoxifies the nitrate or the ammonium nitrogen  
**[0:43:07-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:07):**  by combining with photosynthate and carbon from photosynthesis that provides the carbon base for  
**[0:43:16-0:43:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:16):**  those amino acids and then the nitrogen is translocated as the amino acid. If you don't have  
**[0:43:24-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:24):**  enough nitrate and nitrogen present, you buffer against that high ammonium source that you're  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:31):**  going to get a fumigation because our soil fumigants tend to knock out nitrifying organisms  
**[0:43:39-0:43:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:39):**  so that you don't get nitrification there. It stabilizes it in the ammonium form but it can  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:47):**  actually be drained on the carbon on the energy availability then until that ammonium is  
**[0:43:55-0:44:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:55):**  detoxified and utilized by the plant. So there are changes that take place and that overall function.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:07):**  That answered your question. I'm thinking about what you've described about how many of the  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:15):**  soil borne pathogens, soil borne fungi such as bussarium and verticillium for example,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:20):**  are dependent on oxidizing manganese and limiting manganese absorption by the plant.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:27):**  If that were the case, what would be the impact of adding ammonium to such an ecosystem where  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:35):**  you have a reduced form of nitrogen? What would the impact of the ammonium be on these  
**[0:44:40-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:40):**  soil borne pathogens? On that group of pathogens, you'll see a tremendous reduction in disease.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:48):**  That's with the ammonium nutrition. I have a chapter in one of the annual reviews just on  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:56):**  the impact of the form of nitrogen. You'll see a tremendous benefit with different organisms  
**[0:45:03-0:45:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:03):**  by just selection of the form of nitrogen that that plant is going to be predominantly supplied  
**[0:45:10-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:10):**  with. You may not have to provide the form of nitrogen if you modify the environment so that  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:19):**  those soil microorganisms make those conversions. You'll see that the change that then that form of  
**[0:45:26-0:45:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:26):**  nitrogen will be available for the plant. So it's important that you have both the management tools  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:33):**  as well as the farm. Most of our soils, nitrification takes place very rapidly.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:40):**  So you need to do something to inhibit nitrification. We can do it biologically.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:48):**  There to modify the speed of that reaction so we can increase the amount of nitrogen that  
**[0:45:57-0:46:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:57):**  we use nitrate or ammonium. But when it's taking up ammonium nitrogen, you have a reducing  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:05):**  environment. That reducing environment is favoring your manganese reducing organisms so that  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:12):**  you'll almost always have an increase in manganese availability for the plant when you use a  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:19):**  predominantly ammonium form of nitrogen. The more rapid oxidative farm when you're using  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:28):**  source of nitrogen. What is the impact of carbon to nitrogen ratios on both disease  
**[0:46:34-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:34):**  suppressive soil and also on yield? Carbon nitrogen ratio again depends on the carbon  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:43):**  source. That got me into trouble with my first publication in plant pathology. I challenged  
**[0:46:50-0:46:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:50):**  the carbon nitrogen ratio hypothesis where they were saying that if you have this ratio,  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:57):**  a 12 to 1 ratio versus a 40 to 1, you always have this disease relationship. And I demonstrated  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:05):**  that it's not the carbon to nitrogen ratio, it's the form of nitrogen that is involved in that  
**[0:47:12-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:12):**  ratio. So you can take different crop residues or different cropping sequences and it's the effect  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:23):**  of that sequence on the form of nitrogen that determines what the disease reaction is. And of  
**[0:47:29-0:47:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:29):**  course the effect of that form of nitrogen quite often is an effect on manganese or zinc or copper  
**[0:47:37-0:47:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:37):**  or other nutrients along with the form of nitrogen. But carbon nitrogen ratio works if  
**[0:47:46-0:47:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:46):**  you're working with the same nutrient source or crop residue and then vary the nitrogen  
**[0:47:56-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:56):**  ratios by either harvesting it when it's greener or harvesting it when it's drier when you have  
**[0:48:04-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:04):**  wider carbon nitrogen ratio. But the carbon nitrogen ratio per se isn't the factor that's  
**[0:48:13-0:48:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:13):**  involved there. It's the effect of that ratio on the form of nitrogen and the minerals,  
**[0:48:22-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:22):**  other minerals that are involved such as your manganese or zinc or iron or copper that are all  
**[0:48:29-0:48:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:29):**  critical for particular physiological processes. Don, one of the big pieces that I believe is quite  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:39):**  important that we haven't spoken about is the just the general impact of photosynthesis and the  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:46):**  quality of photosynthesis or perhaps I should say the quality is what would perhaps really the  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:52):**  quantity of photosynthesis that can vary in crops and in cover crops and how that  
**[0:48:58-0:49:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:58):**  influences the volume of root exudates. How can a grower, how can we increase the  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:07):**  quantity of photosynthesis and increase the quantity of root exudates in the soil profile?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:13):**  Of course, you're not going to have any photosynthesis if you don't have manganese.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:19):**  Manganese is critical for splitting the water, you provide the hydrogen and then to combine with  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:26):**  carbon dioxide. You're not going to have any photosynthesis without magnesium as part of the  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:31):**  chlorophyll molecule. You're not going to have very efficient photosynthesis without iron and sulfur  
**[0:49:37-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:37):**  and all of your other minerals because your physiology is all tied together.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:43):**  And if you want to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis, first place to look is going  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:50):**  to be your mineral availability. Having that system work so that you don't have a backlog of  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:58):**  sugar as fructose or glucose. You want that sugar to be stored as sucrose.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:06):**  Changes the osmotic relationship, changes the overall physiology of the plant.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:12):**  It can be converted then all the way to sucrose. Well, you're also not going to have any sucrose  
**[0:50:19-0:50:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:19):**  if you don't have manganese because it's responsible for your sucrose phosphate  
**[0:50:26-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:26):**  synthase enzyme as a cofactor. But it's a system that works together. You don't have sulfur,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:34):**  you don't have enzymes because most of your proteins are initiated with either cysteine  
**[0:50:41-0:50:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:41):**  or methionine, your sulfur amino acids. And again, your C4 plants have a more efficient photosynthetic  
**[0:50:52-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:52):**  pathway. They have peptorboxylase as well as the rubisco enzyme to capture that carbon dioxide  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:00):**  from the air and combine it with the hydrogen that is split off the water by manganese. So you have  
**[0:51:07-0:51:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:07):**  C4 plants, C3 plants and the physiology that's involved. But all of them require the mineral  
**[0:51:16-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:16):**  nutrients for our fish. And any one of those deficiencies influences the overall efficiency  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:28):**  of the whole process. In the research work that we have done in the field looking at various crops,  
**[0:51:35-0:51:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:35):**  I have suggested that what we have come to accept as common or normal, I suppose depending on how  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:44):**  you define normal, are crops that are photosynthesizing at only a fraction of their  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:50):**  inherent capacity, perhaps as little as 20 to 25% in a few cases, perhaps even less than that.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:57):**  What are your thoughts? Do you see the possibility for plants to increase photosynthesis  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:02):**  volume much more than what we normally anticipate?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:07):**  Well, we're only touching the tip of the iceberg as far as what the potential of that plant is.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:13):**  And probably the most limiting factor is carbon dioxide. If you increase carbon dioxide, if we would  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:21):**  just increase it a small amount, you'll have an exponential increase in the amount of photosynthesis,  
**[0:52:29-0:52:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:29):**  which then gives us the oxygen that we need. So that, again, the systems tie together.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:36):**  If we limit carbon dioxide, we limit the amount of oxygen that is available for our growth and our use  
**[0:52:45-0:52:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:45):**  also. But there are many things we can vary the structure, the morphology of the plant from a  
**[0:52:55-0:53:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:55):**  leaf standpoint to capture the sunlight more efficiently. It doesn't do much good to do that  
**[0:53:04-0:53:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:04):**  if we don't have the carbon dioxide available. And on a corn plant, for instance, 250 bushel  
**[0:53:13-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:13):**  yield potential, 20% of that carbon dioxide is coming from the soil. But if we have a sterile  
**[0:53:20-0:53:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:20):**  soil, we don't have respiration going on in the soil and utilization of that organic matter that  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:28):**  we're applying to the soil so that we can get that respiration and carbon dioxide. We compromise the  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:35):**  photosynthesis because there's not enough carbon dioxide in the soil to produce that high yield  
**[0:53:41-0:53:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:41):**  potential and the quality of the crop that we want without that additional carbon dioxide coming from  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:47):**  the soil and the turnover of organic matter. Well, organic matter is great in the soil, we want to  
**[0:53:54-0:54:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:53:54):**  maintain it for a number of reasons. But if it's just sitting there as straw or a stubble, not  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:01):**  decomposing as we see in some of these corn fields, where all of the residues just sitting there  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:09):**  tear up your tractor tires, it's not doing us very much good from a production standpoint. We want to  
**[0:54:16-0:54:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:16):**  have it breaking down, we want to form the humates, the phobic acids and those materials that give us  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:26):**  that overall ecology in the soil that give us crop production. And one of the pieces that I have said,  
**[0:54:36-0:54:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:36):**  which really captures people's attention is one of the important reasons to have soil organic matter  
**[0:54:41-0:54:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:41):**  is so that we can lose it so that we gain. That's correct. We're still limited on carbon dioxide.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:48):**  And our C4 plants are so efficient, and yet we're not tapping into that efficiency on the plants  
**[0:54:57-0:55:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:57):**  because we limit our carbon dioxide. Again, like you say, if it's not working for us,  
**[0:55:06-0:55:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:06):**  it's really working against us. When we look at the horticultural space,  
**[0:55:15-0:55:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:15):**  indoor greenhouse production, when we increase the CO2 levels to 1100 parts per million,  
**[0:55:23-0:55:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:23):**  that increase with the exact same lighting, exact same environmental conditions produces about double  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:29):**  the plant biomass just because of increased photosynthesis. That's correct. Our limiting  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:33):**  factor in many of these situations is carbon dioxide, our most limiting mineral.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:41):**  So what is the potential for plants to increase the volume of photosynthesis?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:46):**  Oh, the potential is 100%. I mean, fivefold, tenfold, depending on where we are now and what  
**[0:55:54-0:56:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:54):**  the plant is. There are a number of different ways to do that. Again, I mentioned plant morphology,  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:04):**  but you can also do it with increasing light intensity. You've got a lot of leaves on a  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:12):**  corn plant, a mature corn plant or a corn plant at tasseling time that aren't getting very much  
**[0:56:19-0:56:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:19):**  sunlight, not photosynthesizing near what their potential would be because of that lack of  
**[0:56:28-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:28):**  sunlight. That's where morphology comes in. But plant spacing, we can increase the number of  
**[0:56:35-0:56:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:35):**  years on a corn plant. You look at the tremendous work that Gary Ohal is doing at Purdue, for  
**[0:56:45-0:56:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:45):**  instance, as a corn breeder, corn geneticist, five and six years on a corn plant, so that  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:53):**  you increase the efficiency of that plant. And you don't need as high a population so that you  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:00):**  can minimize that crowding and that shading type effect. There are just a number of ways that we  
**[0:57:07-0:57:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:07):**  can do that. We can reduce the allelopathic effect of our plants when they're to increase  
**[0:57:16-0:57:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:16):**  the population. And corn, very critical that you have even germination. If you delay germination  
**[0:57:24-0:57:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:24):**  six to eight days, you automatically reduce the size of your ear by the allelopathic effect,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:32):**  that auto-intoxication effect of the root exudates on an adjacent plant by as much as 80%.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:40):**  Wow. When the John Deere Max-emerge planter came out, I remember how it was almost an instant  
**[0:57:48-0:57:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:48):**  success because it increased the soil feed interface, that contact that gave you that  
**[0:57:55-0:58:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:55):**  or uniform emergence. And so you minimize that allelopathic auto-intoxication suppression that  
**[0:58:05-0:58:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:05):**  you had otherwise from those higher populations. We could increase our population and maintain that  
**[0:58:13-0:58:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:13):**  full yield potential without having the allelopathic chemicals reducing the overall  
**[0:58:21-0:58:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:21):**  production potential of that particular plant. You know, there are just a number of things we  
**[0:58:27-0:58:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:27):**  could do if we needed to. Right now we're concerned about a surplus and maintaining market  
**[0:58:35-0:58:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:35):**  on those things. The biggest thing is that necessity is still the mother of invention,  
**[0:58:41-0:58:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:41):**  but there's plenty of potential there. When a group of us that in our team programs that we had  
**[0:58:48-0:58:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:48):**  at Purdue University, a lot of us had the privilege of working in and one of our huddle sessions or  
**[0:58:55-0:59:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:55):**  brainstorming sessions, we asked Charles Fye what the genetic potential, the biochemical genetic  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:03):**  potential of a corn plant was. And he said, oh, let me work on it for a little while. And a couple  
**[0:59:09-0:59:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:09):**  of weeks later when we were all together, he said, I've got your answer. And we were shooting for  
**[0:59:16-0:59:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:16):**  350, 400 bushel. We knew that a lot of our better farmers, this would be back in the late 70s,  
**[0:59:24-0:59:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:24):**  a lot of our better farmers had the potential for 550 or even 600 bushel that we were trying  
**[0:59:32-0:59:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:32):**  to design some systems for them to achieve that on a field basis. And Charles sat down and we said,  
**[0:59:41-0:59:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:41):**  welcome, is this 600 bushel really a realistic figure? And he said, oh, you're all pessimists.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:50):**  Biochemical genetics of that plant are about 1100 bushel. And so you see what we could do  
**[0:59:59-1:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:59):**  if we manage that environment and the plant in a proper manner and provided the expression.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:06):**  We probably won't come close to achieving that until the necessity is there. Probably the most  
**[1:00:13-1:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:13):**  limiting factor that we have to achieve that is the innovation of man. And you see, as long as  
**[1:00:21-1:00:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:21):**  we're doing okay, we don't have that burr under our saddle that would have us look at both the  
**[1:00:29-1:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:29):**  genetics as well as the environment to get an expression of that genetic material. So what  
**[1:00:36-1:00:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:36):**  yields did you end up achieving on your field trials that you were conducting? We could get  
**[1:00:41-1:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:41):**  400 bushel. You had farmers that were getting, that was the time with Herman Warsaw and the group  
**[1:00:49-1:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:49):**  that were 350, where the average was still 75 bushel. They were doing three or four or five  
**[1:00:57-1:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:57):**  times what the average was on a measured piece of land. They were doing it because they recognized  
**[1:01:05-1:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:05):**  that it's an ecology that we're managing. And they started out with the soil, had a beautiful soil.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:12):**  I remember visiting Herman Warsaw's farm and you could take a steel probe and you didn't have to  
**[1:01:19-1:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:19):**  lean on it. You just pushed it in the soil three feet. He had that system working for him very well.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:27):**  You get into some of the other neighbors and try and push that. You get it down three or four  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:37):**  inch tubes and then you had to really put some pressure on it. You get it down a foot and a half  
**[1:01:42-1:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:42):**  and you're driving it in. I can't tell you how many of the old king tubes are still sitting  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:49):**  out there in the field. Those were tubes that you could drive into the soil,  
**[1:01:54-1:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:54):**  like the soil sample at three and four feet. In order to get it in a lot of our soils,  
**[1:02:01-1:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:01):**  you're using a sledgehammer. Then the problem was pulling it out. You would tear the metal off  
**[1:02:07-1:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:07):**  of the tube with the jack and finally you just crimped it over so that it wouldn't tear up the tire  
**[1:02:15-1:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:15):**  and you left it there. There are a lot of them still sitting out there in those fields because  
**[1:02:21-1:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:21):**  we didn't have that concept or the soil wasn't a major part of the management program.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:29):**  We in general would look at the nutrients and forget that all of that's part of an ecology that  
**[1:02:37-1:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:37):**  needs to be managed so that you have water percolation, you have your biology, your air  
**[1:02:44-1:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:44):**  exchange and those things have to take place if you want to capitalize on the genetic potential  
**[1:02:50-1:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:50):**  of the plant. What was the amount of plant populations that growers were using to achieve  
**[1:02:56-1:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:56):**  350 plus portals per acre? You had the old Pioneer 3532, I think it was, hybrid that  
**[1:03:06-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:06):**  took up 95% of its nitrogen by tasseling time and then it merely recycled it.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:13):**  So get on to sandy soils, it was a great hybrid because you couldn't maintain your nitrogen  
**[1:03:19-1:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:19):**  availability in those sands and it would take it up and store it. But it had a yield potential of  
**[1:03:26-1:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:26):**  about 125 bushel at 24,000 plants, which was our standard at the time. But you could increase the  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:34):**  population of that particular variety because it didn't have the allelopathic effects from the root  
**[1:03:40-1:03:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:40):**  exudates with high populations. It had a fixed year, so as you increase the population you still  
**[1:03:48-1:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:48):**  maintain that same year length, it wasn't a big year like your yield hybrid, but it was very  
**[1:03:56-1:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:56):**  stable and it tolerated high populations so they got the yield up by increasing population.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:02):**  With our other varieties, our high yielding varieties, they're hybrids, there you had a more  
**[1:04:08-1:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:08):**  of a flex there that related to the environment more dynamically and the higher the yield  
**[1:04:15-1:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:15):**  potential the more nitrogen you want as ammonia. With the 3532 50-50 ratio of ammonia was optimum  
**[1:04:25-1:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:25):**  for us. When you get into the higher yield and 250 300 bushel yields you want 75 to 80 percent  
**[1:04:34-1:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:34):**  of your nitrogen as ammonium and only 10 to 20 percent as the nitrate source of nitrogen because  
**[1:04:43-1:04:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:43):**  you want all of the photosynthesis that you can to go into the kernel. And if you have, when the  
**[1:04:49-1:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:49):**  plant utilizes nitrate nitrogen and most plants can utilize either farm equally well, but it takes  
**[1:04:56-1:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:56):**  15 to 20 percent of your photosynthate to reduce nitrate nitrogen back to the amine farm so that  
**[1:05:03-1:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:03):**  the plant can utilize it. And so the higher your yield potential the more ammonium nitrogen you  
**[1:05:10-1:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:10):**  want to provide that those amino acids for that growth and your enzymes and everything and the  
**[1:05:17-1:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:17):**  least nitrate nitrogen. We always found that there was a benefit to some nitrate nitrogen because it  
**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:25):**  serves as a buffer both to limit the drain on carbohydrate if you have a high uptake of ammonium  
**[1:05:32-1:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:32):**  nitrogen. Nitrate will tend to balance that suppressant down a little bit and but also as a  
**[1:05:40-1:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:40):**  stable form of nitrogen if you run short then you can use some of that photosynthate. If you have  
**[1:05:47-1:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:47):**  molybdenum and you have your other nutrients that are available to have are the function of your  
**[1:05:53-1:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:53):**  nitrate nitrite reductase enzyme. Again you have a different physiological pathway and sometimes if  
**[1:06:01-1:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:01):**  you're just saying well I'm going to get most of mine from an aminoidal source you may forget that  
**[1:06:09-1:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:09):**  you also have to have molybdenum for some of those other enzymes that aren't quite as dynamic or  
**[1:06:16-1:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:16):**  quite as involved as they are if you're relying more on the nitrate source. But those are some  
**[1:06:24-1:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:24):**  of the things you could do to enhance that overall photosynthetic efficiency by just linking a farm  
**[1:06:33-1:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:33):**  of nitrogen that's going to also influence your soil biology and your buffering capacity in  
**[1:06:41-1:06:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:41):**  in those areas. So Don it's 1979 you're producing 350 plus bushels of corn per acre in a biological  
**[1:06:52-1:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:52):**  or in a biological soil ecosystem. Today it's 2017 and growers are struggling to produce 250 bushel  
**[1:07:01-1:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:01):**  corn. We don't even have a conversation about growing 350 bushel corn on a commercial field  
**[1:07:06-1:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:06):**  scale. There are a few notable exceptions but not on a large scale production system across the  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:12):**  board. What happened with that knowledge? Where did it go or why? Let me ask the question a little  
**[1:07:17-1:07:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:17):**  bit differently. Why was it not adopted on a much broader scale? We started saying we have too much  
**[1:07:25-1:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:25):**  production. We need to focus in different areas. Our land grant universities that were established  
**[1:07:32-1:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:32):**  a lot of that research and especially for your long-term commitments that a breeding program  
**[1:07:38-1:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:38):**  requires for each suppression of that genetic potential. Those programs were closed out and  
**[1:07:47-1:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:47):**  materials were just given to the private companies to develop your experiment stations. We're happy  
**[1:07:54-1:08:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:54):**  to not have that long-term commitment. They could then respond to the political pressures and your  
**[1:08:02-1:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:02):**  program started being limited to three to five years through the competitive grants programs on  
**[1:08:08-1:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:08):**  a federal scale and most of our breeding programs were funded through the Hatch program, Smith-Lever  
**[1:08:15-1:08:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:15):**  program that would give the states a constant amount of money on a formula basis for those  
**[1:08:22-1:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:22):**  long-term agricultural developments that are the reason why we have the success in our agricultural  
**[1:08:32-1:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:32):**  programs today or build on those long-term continuous programs that were pretty much  
**[1:08:40-1:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:40):**  abandoned as we started looking at the bells and whistles in science rather than looking at the  
**[1:08:48-1:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:48):**  end product that we desired. Again we were producing more than we knew what to do with.  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:55):**  I don't know what we'd do with all the corn that we currently produce if we weren't producing  
**[1:09:00-1:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:00):**  so much alcohol. That's the way to use your crop, find a new market for it. Certainly population  
**[1:09:11-1:09:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:11):**  growth is a long way from requiring what our current production is and as Paul Wagner and his  
**[1:09:18-1:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:18):**  cash bulletin and with the group that he had he worked with showed that we could produce enough  
**[1:09:26-1:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:26):**  food for about 15 billion people with about 30 percent less land if we wanted to really do that,  
**[1:09:35-1:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:35):**  really needed to do that with the technology that we had in 1964. But like you say we were  
**[1:09:42-1:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:42):**  shooting for 400 bushel in 1980, 79 and 1980 and now we're struggling with 250 bushel but  
**[1:09:54-1:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:54):**  sometimes you have to reinvent the wheel because that part of the system was not considered  
**[1:10:01-1:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:01):**  important and the resources were transferred. In a breeding program you don't just turn it on and off  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:09):**  with each little whim or political idea that comes along. It's a long-term program.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:16):**  When we turned all of that material over to the private companies, their interest was the bottom  
**[1:10:24-1:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:24):**  line. So there's a tremendous amount of material that could be manipulated but as far as that  
**[1:10:31-1:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:31):**  long-term commitment there hasn't been any of that. Genetic engineering has certainly not improved the  
**[1:10:40-1:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:40):**  long-term effect because you get the idea that we can do it all in a laboratory by just switching  
**[1:10:47-1:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:47):**  this system on or inhibiting this particular system. We forget that it's still a system,  
**[1:10:55-1:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:55):**  an ecology that has to be managed if any of that's going to be of any value to it. And it's a thought  
**[1:11:02-1:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:02):**  process that's involved as well as the necessity but also the desire, the innovation drops out  
**[1:11:13-1:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:13):**  when you forget that you're a part of a very dynamic beautiful system that was all put  
**[1:11:20-1:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:20):**  together and you start only focusing on one thing and silver bullets and forget that silver bullets  
**[1:11:28-1:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:28):**  may take care of environment but they don't provide stability in the system.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:34):**  Yeah. Don, what is something you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other people don't believe to be true?  
**[1:11:44-1:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:44):**  I don't know. I think everything I believe to be true is there are a lot of people that feel the  
**[1:11:50-1:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:50):**  same way. They may not be quite as outspoken as I've been. I think again when you focus  
**[1:12:01-1:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:01):**  on just one item and forget all of these systems work together you automatically compromise your  
**[1:12:09-1:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:09):**  potential and sometimes we have to realize that you have to make a few mistakes in order to do  
**[1:12:16-1:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:16):**  that. We're making plenty of them now I think. Maybe that's part of the gray hair that I carry  
**[1:12:23-1:12:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:23):**  around with me that gives me that. I also see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:31):**  The tremendous damage that we're doing wise to our children really hurts to think of your  
**[1:12:38-1:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:38):**  grandchildren having a shorter life expectancy as CDC has stated than I have, than my potential.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:48):**  But it doesn't have to be. Sometimes we have to smash our thumb to realize that maybe you  
**[1:12:54-1:13:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:12:54):**  needed glasses to find a nail but you have to again refocus. I think your program is an excellent  
**[1:13:04-1:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:04):**  program. You're successful in communicating a lot of the importance of managing the system  
**[1:13:15-1:13:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:15):**  rather than just looking at the bottom line that happens to look very fascinating to us right now  
**[1:13:21-1:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:21):**  or very easy for us. Looking at and putting it in perspective is what we need to do and I  
**[1:13:30-1:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:30):**  see some young people that are able to express that a lot better than I am. You're one of those  
**[1:13:35-1:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:35):**  that I admire, have a great deal of confidence in the ability of you to get that job done.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:44):**  Well thanks for saying that it's all that I've learned and I've been able to communicate.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:51):**  There are things that I've learned from wise elders such as yourself so it's really a big thanks to you.  
**[1:13:57-1:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:13:57):**  Don, what do you see as the biggest opportunity in agriculture today?  
**[1:14:03-1:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:03):**  Reinventing the wheel.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:04):**  Reinventing the wheel? Reinventing the wheel?  
**[1:14:08-1:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:08):**  The greatest need anyway is getting back to nutrient density and eliminating the pesticides  
**[1:14:16-1:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:16):**  especially the glyphosate which is you know you put it on a zero to a hundred scale and  
**[1:14:22-1:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:22):**  glyphosate from Chuck Benbrook's research at Washington State goes that it's on a scale of  
**[1:14:29-1:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:29):**  about 82. All other pesticides together other than the neonicotinoids which would be at about  
**[1:14:37-1:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:37):**  a 14. All of the other pesticides together from a health standpoint are less than the one.  
**[1:14:44-1:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:44):**  Wow that's incredible. I was not aware of that.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:47):**  We focus on a lot of those that are in that less than one not that we shouldn't but we  
**[1:14:53-1:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:14:53):**  totally ignored the one primary material that is doing the greatest health and an environmental  
**[1:15:02-1:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:02):**  standpoint and that's because it's not just a pesticide per se. An antibiotic it's a strong  
**[1:15:08-1:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:08):**  mineral chelator it has the ability to essentially disrupt everything that we value in our ecology  
**[1:15:16-1:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:16):**  and our own subsistence and that needs to be removed from our soil because and from our food  
**[1:15:26-1:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:26):**  especially because of that wide scope of damage that it's doing. I'm not opposed to tools in  
**[1:15:35-1:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:35):**  agriculture and making things easier. I never could find a hoe that I felt was really designed  
**[1:15:43-1:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:43):**  to fit my hand. That wasn't my father's decision but that was my concept of what that hoe should  
**[1:15:52-1:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:15:52):**  be. I remember when 2,4-D was available to us after World War II and what a tremendous tool we  
**[1:16:01-1:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:01):**  thought it was but it also requires some common sense and some recognition that we don't have  
**[1:16:09-1:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:09):**  silver bullets we have an ecology that we need to manage and if we manage it effectively it'll  
**[1:16:16-1:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:16):**  service for the eternities. If we don't then we have to go through correction phases that  
**[1:16:23-1:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:23):**  can be very painful for our self-fulfilling prophecies of food shortages and that. You look  
**[1:16:31-1:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:31):**  at the recent elections you see the change in the German government that took place,  
**[1:16:39-1:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:39):**  but a surprising change for many people took place because of agriculture and you can go through  
**[1:16:46-1:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:46):**  history and show how important agriculture is. It's the basic infrastructure of any society  
**[1:16:53-1:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:53):**  and when we file it up there are consequences and it requires a correction in that manner and  
**[1:17:00-1:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:00):**  I think we're seeing the pendulum swinging now so we're recognizing the need for nutrient density,  
**[1:17:07-1:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:07):**  the need to eliminate a lot of the exposure that we have to the glyphosate and some of the other  
**[1:17:15-1:17:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:15):**  chemicals that have been accumulating in our environment and in our food supply.  
**[1:17:20-1:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:20):**  So I see that pendulum swinging. I think it's going to, we'll see those changes taking place  
**[1:17:27-1:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:27):**  not as fast as I'd like to see but they're coming and I don't move very fast either so  
**[1:17:35-1:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:35):**  I can't necessarily complain in those processes. It's critical that we recognize our stewardship  
**[1:17:43-1:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:43):**  that we have when it comes to the soil and to our own survivability in these areas rather than just  
**[1:17:51-1:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:51):**  accepting the changes that have occurred and say well there's nothing we can do about it now.  
**[1:17:58-1:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:58):**  Well there's a tremendous amount and matter again understanding that we're managing inequality,  
**[1:18:06-1:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:06):**  that we're a part of that and great opportunities for us to do things better.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:13):**  Yeah Don what are some books or some resources that you would recommend to growers  
**[1:18:19-1:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:19):**  they want to learn more?  
**[1:18:20-1:18:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:20):**  Well you have the Phytopath Society under the direction of Lawrence Dattinoff,  
**[1:18:28-1:18:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:28):**  kind of provided the nudge to keep us going and that burned our saddle but  
**[1:18:34-1:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:34):**  you have a number of resources and American Phytopath published the green book on  
**[1:18:40-1:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:40):**  Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease. If you're interested in the relationships there I think  
**[1:18:46-1:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:46):**  that's a good book. I'll plug it I'm one of the editors on it I don't get compensation for that.  
**[1:18:53-1:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:53):**  You have Marschner's book certainly is probably the bible in Plant Nutrition on Mineral Nutrition  
**[1:19:00-1:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:00):**  of Fire Plant. It's a little detailed or a little deeper than a lot of people want to go.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:07):**  You have a lot of the older books the Albrecht system you have they're just just a number of  
**[1:19:13-1:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:13):**  resources if a person really wants to make the changes. You have your programs that you're  
**[1:19:21-1:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:21):**  working up you're able to communicate with the growers. I think you see eight or ten different  
**[1:19:28-1:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:28):**  systems now looking at nutrient density. How do we measure it? How do we define it? But at least  
**[1:19:34-1:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:34):**  getting a lot of that background information that's necessary for us to really make the  
**[1:19:40-1:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:40):**  application. Overall I think that George Romney under the when he managed to get the Constitutional  
**[1:19:49-1:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:49):**  Convention put together for the state of Michigan had the opportunity of serving in that process.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:57):**  But he made the comment once that science can lead to progress. This is paraphrasing it can lead to  
**[1:20:04-1:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:04):**  progress. We recognize that with each scientific accomplishment there are some unintended  
**[1:20:10-1:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:10):**  consequences and we also deal with the unintended consequences. Then we'll see that continuing  
**[1:20:17-1:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:17):**  plateauing growing for us increasing. If we don't recognize that science is merely a tool that we  
**[1:20:26-1:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:26):**  have and we rely solely on it without recognizing that there are unintended consequences then it  
**[1:20:33-1:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:33):**  can come back and bite us pretty hard. I think that's what we're seeing in the our general  
**[1:20:39-1:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:39):**  adoption of genetic engineering without recognizing the unintended consequences that are  
**[1:20:47-1:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:47):**  built into that system either from a mutation standpoint or threat damage that is done. Then  
**[1:20:55-1:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:55):**  there's a reckoning process that we'll all have to go through. We're going through it now if you  
**[1:21:00-1:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:00):**  look at the health consequences all you have to do is go to a cancer tumor center or our  
**[1:21:08-1:21:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:08):**  doing a child development center. Go to a maternity ward and see what the birth defect that we're  
**[1:21:15-1:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:15):**  seeing now are becoming so prevalent that you can't ignore them. So we're probably in that  
**[1:21:22-1:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:22):**  reckoning stage and at a time when it becomes important that we start looking back in the box  
**[1:21:31-1:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:31):**  rather than just outside the box for those solutions that we need for society.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:37):**  Don what is a question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[1:21:40-1:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:40):**  I don't know I've been gabbing so much that I haven't been thinking about what you should ask.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:44):**  I think you asked some questions I'd hoped you would. I may not have given you time to do those  
**[1:21:51-1:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:51):**  but I'm certainly from the topics that we've been on today I didn't get into the GMO glyphosate that  
**[1:21:58-1:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:58):**  kind of takes us a little different direction. Very critical when it comes to nutrient density  
**[1:22:04-1:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:04):**  because of its impact on the soil ecology as a whole or our entire ecology because it's such a  
**[1:22:14-1:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:14):**  strong mineral chelator as well as that antibiotic effect and the antibiotic effect may be a greater  
**[1:22:21-1:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:21):**  damage than just the direct chelation. Now it's a broad spectrum antibiotic because it's a broad  
**[1:22:29-1:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:29):**  spectrum chelator but those areas but I'm really happy to see a lot of the emphasis coming back  
**[1:22:37-1:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:37):**  to soil ecology the role of different crops and the rotation or in the overall cropping system  
**[1:22:44-1:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:44):**  and use of cover crops. I'm really excited to see that that's something that 60 years ago when I  
**[1:22:52-1:23:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:52):**  started in plant pathology and looking at the effect of crop residues and crop sequencing on  
**[1:23:00-1:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:00):**  the soil borne diseases and there's got to be a better way than saying well you can only grow  
**[1:23:07-1:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:07):**  an economic crop or your primary economic crop every eight years because the disease pressure  
**[1:23:13-1:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:13):**  is going to build up on you to the point that it's not going to be economical and we could  
**[1:23:17-1:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:17):**  demonstrate that very easily back in the 1950s and 60s what those effects were but then in the  
**[1:23:25-1:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:25):**  remediation aspect or maintaining the balance and that soil environment the fact that 85 percent of  
**[1:23:33-1:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:33):**  that effect is the immediately preceding crop means that you can do essentially everything  
**[1:23:39-1:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:39):**  that we're doing in a five or an eight year rotation and at the same time we're growing  
**[1:23:45-1:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:45):**  economic crop and even do better when we look at the improvement in supporting that growing crop  
**[1:23:53-1:24:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:53):**  from a nutritional standpoint from nitrogen or other minerals through the form of nitrogen that  
**[1:24:00-1:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:00):**  we can influence with that farm or with that particular crop food exit aid so I think those  
**[1:24:06-1:24:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:06):**  are really exciting. Other people don't seem to get quite as excited as I do but it takes me back  
**[1:24:14-1:24:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:14):**  to those things that those questions that I had well how do we do this better if these are things  
**[1:24:20-1:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:20):**  that we need to do from a biological standpoint isn't there a way to compress some of that  
**[1:24:26-1:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:26):**  process and make it capitalize on the potential dynamics of it although we see the end product on  
**[1:24:34-1:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:34):**  a consistent basis rather than just the ups and downs that we would have otherwise. It's an  
**[1:24:42-1:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:42):**  exciting time to see what the next generation's doing what they're looking at now and you see it  
**[1:24:51-1:25:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:51):**  going both ways. Sometimes you have to do that in order to recognize how it fits back together.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:01):**  I do agree that there are very exciting times and there are lots of new innovations and also  
**[1:25:08-1:25:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:08):**  as you described lots of reinventing the wheel happening and those are good things. Don thank  
**[1:25:14-1:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:14):**  you very much for joining us. I have enjoyed this interview tremendously and I'm sure our listeners  
**[1:25:19-1:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:19):**  will as well. It's been a tremendous honor to have you here and we look forward to possibly having  
**[1:25:24-1:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:24):**  you back in the future. Thank you very much. Appreciate all you do and very honored to be a  
**[1:25:30-1:25:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:30):**  part here with you. Thanks Don. This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for  
**[1:25:37-1:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:37):**  AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture, the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AEA,  
**[1:25:44-1:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:44):**  we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow  
**[1:25:50-1:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:50):**  crops. We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow  
**[1:25:55-1:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:55):**  healthy plants we must first think differently about agriculture, about empowering life instead  
**[1:26:01-1:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:26:01):**  of suppressing life, about regeneration instead of degeneration. To achieve this we formulate and  
**[1:26:08-1:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:26:08):**  sell products that help growers produce higher quality yield with less risk of crop failure.  
**[1:26:13-1:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:26:13):**  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk. Thank you for listening.

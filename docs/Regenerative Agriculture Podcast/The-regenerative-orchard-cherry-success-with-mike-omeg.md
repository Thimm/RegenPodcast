**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:04:58):**  Thanks for having me here.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:00):**  Mike, you've been considered to be a leader  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:04):**  and an innovator in the fruit production world  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:07):**  for some time.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:08):**  What was it that drove you and led you  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:10):**  to constantly be trying new practices  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:13):**  and how has your orchard evolved and shifted  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:17):**  over the last decade?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:19):**  Well, one of the things that motivated me  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:22):**  to always be trying new things is that I was never  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:27):**  and I am never satisfied with the status quo.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:31):**  I think that I have a natural tendency to say,  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:37):**  are we doing things the best that we can  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:40):**  and is there a better way?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:43):**  I never get comfortable in saying,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:45):**  I have everything figured out, this is the sweet spot  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:49):**  and I'm just gonna stay right here.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:51):**  I think that just as life changes at every moment,  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:57):**  we need to be changing in our business  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:05:59):**  and how we manage ourselves every moment.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:02):**  And I follow a few principles,  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:06):**  but one of them was said nicely  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:08):**  by a chemistry professor of mine in college  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:11):**  and she said, question everything.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:14):**  And so that's what I do.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:16):**  It's been something that my family, my grandparents  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:20):**  and my parents before me, as they managed our land  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:23):**  have always been focused on doing the best job that we can.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:28):**  And that means trying and failing and succeeding.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:33):**  All those things are wrapped into somebody  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:36):**  that is trying to figure out how to do things differently  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:39):**  and do things better.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:41):**  Mike, I think that's very important.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:44):**  That's actually a recurring theme from other farmers  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:46):**  that I've spoken with as well  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:48):**  is that they constantly question everything.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:51):**  And so when you're constantly questioning  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:54):**  what's happening on your operations,  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:55):**  what have been some of the questions  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:58):**  and some of the answers that intrigued you,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:01):**  that surprised you?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:02):**  I think one of the important periods of questions  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:08):**  was right before that you actually, John,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:10):**  I'd been looking at our conventional production practices  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:14):**  here on my farm and looking at over time,  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:22):**  a ever diminishing return on our investment of time,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:26):**  of capital, of labor in our financial returns.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:31):**  And what I mean by that is it was getting harder and harder  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:34):**  for us to eke out that premium return  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:38):**  that we wanted for our fruit.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:41):**  We were just having a harder time generating  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:45):**  that difference between, I guess you might say,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:49):**  wholesale cherries and what we consider  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:52):**  as a premium market cherry.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:55):**  And so I looked at our production system and said,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:00):**  my gosh, we are just focusing on the top of the tree.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:05):**  The parts of the cherry tree that you could see  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:08):**  with the naked eye, boy, we've gotten really good  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:13):**  at growing that part of the tree.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:16):**  Of course, nothing was ever perfect  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:18):**  as I mentioned previously, but I was,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:21):**  for lack of a better term, running out of good ideas.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:24):**  The creative tank was running low on things  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:28):**  that we could do better with the management of the tree  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:30):**  as you can see it.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:32):**  And so I thought, what about the parts of the tree  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:36):**  you can't see?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:38):**  And that led me to a really great exploration  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:45):**  of the soils and roots and that often forgotten part  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:53):**  of orchards and conventional farming logic,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:55):**  which is the ground.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:58):**  Everyone knows as farmers that the soil is important.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:01):**  When we buy a new piece of land or we look at planting  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:05):**  a new orchard, the first thing that we look at  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:10):**  is the quality of the soil.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:12):**  But after that, the way that I was farming  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:16):**  in a conventional matter, we quit paying attention  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:20):**  to the quality of our soil and just started focusing  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:23):**  on those things I mentioned with just the top of the tree.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:26):**  How can we prune it?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:27):**  How can we plant varieties?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:29):**  How can we do training systems, irrigation system design  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:33):**  and that sort of thing, everything that you could see  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:37):**  and pay no attention to the ground.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:42):**  And I think that was probably one of the most exciting  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:46):**  things for me personally and professionally  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:49):**  is when I opened up a whole new set of challenges  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:54):**  with how we could improve our soils and improve  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:58):**  our tree health by looking below the soil surface.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:03):**  And it really got me charged up about farming again.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:08):**  Not to say that I wasn't already excited about farming,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:11):**  but it really was one of those things  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:13):**  that was exciting and new.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:17):**  And brought me a lot of great satisfaction.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:24):**  Mike, when you started looking at soils  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:26):**  and thinking about managing the invisible part of the tree,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:30):**  how did that affect your farming operation  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:34):**  in terms of practical management?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:36):**  Did you end up making any management changes?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:38):**  How did that change your farming operation?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:40):**  Over time, we made a lot of changes to how we farm.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:49):**  It's not to say that we did a lot of corrective actions  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:53):**  because we were farming conventionally,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:59):**  but orchards are fortunate in that we don't do  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:02):**  a lot of tillage, we don't do a lot of the mechanical things  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:06):**  that and other crops are harmful to the soil.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:12):**  And we also had a permanent crop in place  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:16):**  where our renewal cycle on an orchard  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:20):**  is typically between 25 and 35 years.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:24):**  So we'll plant an orchard and leave it in place  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:26):**  for 25 or 35 years.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:28):**  And so that gave us opportunities to do things  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:33):**  that other crops may not have the luxury  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:37):**  of being able to do.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:40):**  But we did add a lot of layers to our management  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:45):**  of the orchard, where we did additional activities  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:50):**  that were focused upon that invisible part of the tree,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:53):**  focused upon the soil.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:55):**  And I can talk about those.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:58):**  There was a lot of different things that we tried.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:01):**  Some of them were successful and some of them were not.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:04):**  But over a period of years where we were exploring  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:10):**  new management techniques, we did settle up on some  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:13):**  that we thought worked quite nicely.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:17):**  I would love to expand on those a bit more, Mike.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:19):**  Can you tell us about some of the things that you tried  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:21):**  that perhaps didn't work so well  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:23):**  and then what you eventually ended up doing?  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:26):**  Well, there's lots of things I tried  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:27):**  that didn't work out well.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:28):**  And I think that we all like to talk about the successes,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:32):**  but oftentimes can learn a great deal from failures  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:37):**  or things that didn't turn out so well.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:40):**  I'll start with perhaps one of them that's a mixed bag  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:46):**  because like anything that is worthwhile,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:50):**  this was a complex project ahead of us that we had.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:54):**  And we started out learning about how we could enhance  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:01):**  our soils and things we could do to boost our plants.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:07):**  And one of the challenges that we had was how to scale  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:12):**  that up, how to go from techniques that worked, say,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:18):**  in a small market garden where the grower is selling  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:23):**  directly to consumer, maybe only working part-time,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:28):**  and how do we scale that up to the size of operation  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:31):**  that we had, which is 350 acres of fruit  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:36):**  and 1,800 tons of fruit produced every year.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:42):**  And we started out with things that we thought  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:46):**  would be simple and easy.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:49):**  And one of those was, well, let's put out compost.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:53):**  We'll put out compost on all acres that we have  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:57):**  under management, and that'll be of a benefit for us.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:03):**  So we set a timeframe because you can't do,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:06):**  when you're talking that amount of compost,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:08):**  we couldn't apply compost on all acres.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:11):**  But what we found was that the logistical expense  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:16):**  of moving thousands and thousands of yards of compost  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:21):**  from where it's manufactured, which is,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:24):**  it wasn't anywhere local for us, so we had to go  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:27):**  to the Portland metropolitan area, which is about  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:30):**  80 miles away to get that volume of compost we needed.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:35):**  So getting that compost here, paying for the trucking,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:39):**  paying for an area where you can land that much material,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:43):**  buying or renting equipment that was out of our norm,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:48):**  a bucket loaders and that sort of thing,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:52):**  became a real challenge for us.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:55):**  Just the cost of that material to move it around  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:00):**  and then to get it applied, we had a return  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:04):**  on our investment, but it was a really massive operation.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:09):**  It was, if you will, sucking a lot of diesel,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:13):**  a lot of steel, and that is not where I wanted to go  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:19):**  with biointensive management of my farm.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:23):**  And I think that the compost did work for us,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:28):**  but if I were to do it again, I would have taken  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:31):**  that capital that I invested in the compost  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:36):**  and put it into other material that we produced  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:42):**  here on farm or other techniques.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:44):**  And I think we could have probably had an equal  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:47):**  or better return on our investment for that  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:50):**  with a lot less giant equipment rolling up  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:54):**  and down the roads, giant equipment rolling  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:57):**  at our landings, and then a lot of equipment  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:00):**  to move that material out onto the orchard rows.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:02):**  Mike, obviously you're making these comments  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:06):**  about the possibilities of getting even better ROI  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:09):**  with other techniques based on experience.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:13):**  You're describing that compost applications  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:15):**  were successful and did work for you,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:17):**  but if you were doing it over again,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:19):**  where would you prioritize and where would you focus  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:21):**  based on what you've observed?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:24):**  I think that if I were to start at day zero again  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:29):**  in this process where I would focus a majority  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:32):**  of my energy to would be mulches.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:38):**  What we learned over time is that the primary benefit  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:43):**  that we received from the compost was getting the soil  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:47):**  underneath the tree covered with an organic material.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:52):**  What I learned was that it didn't matter as much  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:00):**  what material was on top of the soil.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:03):**  We put pine chips on top of our soils.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:09):**  We put straw on top of our soils, different types of straw,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:13):**  wheat straw, grass seed straw.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:18):**  What I found was that we were able to get  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:22):**  the soil underneath the tree covered.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:24):**  What I found over time was that the compost was,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:31):**  of course, contributing nutrients and all those things  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:35):**  that we all love compost for.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:37):**  I love compost, of course, but in my flower pots,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:40):**  not on my orchard scale.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:42):**  But what I found was that the material that we were applying  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:47):**  wasn't super great compost.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:50):**  It wasn't super powerful compost  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:53):**  with those humic components that we needed.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:57):**  It was really serving as a mulch where it protected  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:00):**  the soil from sun, from irrigation,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:05):**  the physical damage that irrigation causes.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:08):**  So the thing that I found was that in our orchard systems  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:13):**  where we maintain a permanent side alleyway  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:16):**  in between the tree rows, for generations,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:20):**  our family has just been mowing that alleyway  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:23):**  like many other growers and leaving the clippings  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:29):**  sitting in the alleyway.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:31):**  What I found and arrived at was if we could move that grass  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:37):**  that we cut and windrow it right in the tree row  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:41):**  and cover the soil in the tree row,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:43):**  we could accomplish similar results to the compost  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:47):**  with a fraction of that land laborer and capital investment  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:53):**  that we were making with the compost  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:57):**  and accomplish it with a practice that we already do,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:01):**  which is mow our alleyway rows.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:04):**  And so if I was to pick one thing that we landed on  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:09):**  that improved upon the compost, it would be mow and blow  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:15):**  because we could then go right over the top of that  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:21):**  during the growing season,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:22):**  we would throw our grass clippings onto the tree row  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:27):**  and then in cherries and other tree fruits,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:31):**  pruning is a very important process that we do  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:34):**  during the winter, during a dormant period of the orchard.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:38):**  And we generate a huge amount of carbon  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:41):**  in the form of cut branches that we stack in the alleyway.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:46):**  And just like the grass,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:47):**  we would mow that down and leave it there.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:50):**  But with mow and blow, we're able to shred those prunings  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:55):**  and move them over into the alleyway  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:58):**  with the mow and blow mowers and windrow those,  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:02):**  that carbon source right there in the tree row as well.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:05):**  And boy, that technique really pushed us forward,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:11):**  getting the soil covered,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:13):**  because I think that it allowed us to then put on  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:17):**  some very focused and very fine tuned applications  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:22):**  of nutrients, biological stimulants,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:26):**  a wide variety of things onto the soil, onto that mulch  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:31):**  and get a very rapid response  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:34):**  without the big earth moving equipment process  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:38):**  that the compost required us to do.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:41):**  I think that the value of compost in our systems  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:45):**  is to apply a very purposely made refined compost  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:52):**  that can go on at a fraction of the amount that we applied  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:57):**  when we just bought our compost.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:00):**  We bought our thousands and thousands of yard orders  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:05):**  of municipal compost.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:06):**  Instead, what we started doing was making  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:09):**  a very small amount in comparison  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:11):**  to the thousands of yards amounts we were putting on.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:14):**  We started making here on our farm,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:16):**  very small amounts of purposely made  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:22):**  nutrient focused compost,  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:24):**  where we incorporated nutrients that we knew we needed  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:28):**  in our orchards, but put that material on  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:32):**  in the form of a compost where we put on a fraction of it  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:36):**  and got a lot more bang for our buck  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:38):**  because that compost was really a nutrient input  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:42):**  instead of a mulch input that we had been doing  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:44):**  with the previous compost.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:46):**  Mike, you've mentioned a couple of pieces  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:48):**  I'd like to follow up on.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:49):**  I want to come back at some point  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:51):**  and elaborate a bit more on the nutrient applications  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:53):**  that you were describing,  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:54):**  but also you've identified the Moam Blow  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:58):**  as being foundational to building a soil cover  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:01):**  and covering the soil within the tree row.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:04):**  What are the possibilities of using cover crops  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:08):**  and producing even more biomass  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:10):**  for that Moam Blow operation  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:11):**  in addition to the grass that you're growing?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:14):**  That's a great question, John.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:17):**  We began to utilize cover crops in our alleyways.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:22):**  Since some of your listeners may not understand  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:25):**  everything about orchards here in Oregon,  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:29):**  we maintain an alleyway between the trees  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:33):**  that we can drive up and down.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:35):**  And you need to have some kind of crop  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:37):**  that's growing there to hold the soil in place  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:40):**  so that it doesn't erode  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:43):**  and to keep your orchard from turning into,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:45):**  I'll just say a dust bowl.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:48):**  We don't want to have thousands of small,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:50):**  just dirt roads going up and down our alleyways  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:54):**  through our orchards because that creates  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:56):**  a giant dust plume, which is bad for everybody,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:59):**  especially the soil in our trees.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:01):**  And so we have maintained sod,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:05):**  just perennial ryegrass, creeping red fescue.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:08):**  There's orchard grass, sods.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:11):**  Many growers have their own favorite.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:15):**  And that sod does its job.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:19):**  It holds the soil in place.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:20):**  It keeps the dust down,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:22):**  but it does not contribute a whole lot to the trees.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:27):**  After we landed on the mow and blow technique,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:31):**  we started with just blowing what we already had  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:34):**  in the alleyways over.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:36):**  So blowing our perennial rye, in our case,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:39):**  over into the alleyway is where we started.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:43):**  But I began to say, all right,  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:46):**  is this the best way to do it?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:48):**  Is there something else that we can plant  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:50):**  in the alleyways and blow to the side?  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:54):**  And so cover crops are where we went with our efforts  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:00):**  to generate more biomass in the alleyway  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:04):**  and then transfer that biomass using our mowers  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:07):**  over into the tree row and have it act as a mulch.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:11):**  And we started here with cover cropping  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:15):**  on fallow fields that were waiting to be planted.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:18):**  We would maintain cover crops there.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:19):**  And we had various mixes of plant species  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:23):**  that we utilized in those areas.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:26):**  And we just took those plants  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:28):**  that worked in our fallow fields,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:30):**  big open fields waiting to have orchard trees  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:32):**  replanted into them.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:33):**  And we started putting them in the alleyways.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:36):**  And we had some success and some failure there  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:39):**  because a big open field that has no trees growing above it  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:43):**  is a very different environment  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:45):**  for sun loving cover crop plants  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:47):**  than the shade of an orchard canopy in an alleyway.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:52):**  We have found a series of plants that we really like  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:56):**  to put into our alleyways and grow  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:59):**  that generate a lot of biomass during the dormant season  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:03):**  from basically fall until spring.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:06):**  We don't have a lot of equipment passing over our alleyways  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:11):**  and the cover crop has an opportunity  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:13):**  to grow during that time.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:15):**  And then in the spring, before we start doing  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:18):**  our orchard management activities  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:20):**  where the alleyways are quite busy with equipment,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:23):**  we take that cover crop that's grown over the winter  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:26):**  and generated a lot of biomass  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:28):**  and we blow that over into the tree row.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:31):**  And it generates a good start to our growing season  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:36):**  for the cherries when the soil is starting to warm up.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:39):**  In the tree row, it gets this very nice coating  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:42):**  of adverse species mix of mulch on top of it.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:48):**  Mike, when you have these cover crops  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:50):**  during the winter months,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:52):**  doesn't that have the effect of then choking out the sod?  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:55):**  How do you manage?  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:56):**  Do you still have a sod for the following year?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:58):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:00):**  We maintain two crops in our alleyways each year.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:07):**  We have an overwintering cover crop  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:10):**  and then we plant a fast growing,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:14):**  you might call it a temporary sod.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:16):**  I don't know if it would be proper to call the cover crop  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:19):**  that grows during the warm season in our rows a true sod,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:24):**  but we maintain a green crop there,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:28):**  but it's not grown as cover crop  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:30):**  because it's very difficult to generate  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:33):**  a whole lot of biomass when you have  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:35):**  as many equipment passes going up and down the rows  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:39):**  from essentially May through August is what we do in cherries.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:46):**  We were never able to find a warm season crop  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:50):**  that we could plant and grow as a cover crop  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:53):**  where we generate a lot of biomass  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:55):**  because we just have too many different sized  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:59):**  pieces of equipment.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:00):**  We have ATVs, we have RTVs,  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:02):**  we have various sizes of tractors.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:05):**  And so by the time you take all those tire tracks  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:09):**  and draw them out going down the alleyway,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:11):**  we really only end up with about 24 inches  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:14):**  right in the very center of the alley  
**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:17):**  where anything has an opportunity to grow.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:20):**  And keep in mind, it can't grow that tall  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:22):**  because the plants getting constantly batted down  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:25):**  by equipment passing over the top of it.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:31):**  So in essence, what you're describing,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:33):**  if I'm understanding it correctly,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:34):**  is you actually plant two crops.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:37):**  You plant what you're considering a cover crop in the fall  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:42):**  to produce biomass during the winter months  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:43):**  and then you're planting a soil cover  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:45):**  or a ground cover in the spring, is that right?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:47):**  Yes, that's exactly what we do.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:50):**  Mike, I think this is something  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:51):**  that a lot of people are interested in.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:53):**  It's something that I personally get a lot of questions  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:55):**  about, can you tell us a little bit about the cover crops  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:58):**  that you ended up selecting,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:59):**  particularly for your winter cover,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:01):**  what the rationale was for those?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:04):**  So when we started looking at cover crops,  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:10):**  it was really difficult because when I began my research,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:14):**  what I found quickly was that there is a multitude  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:18):**  of giant laundry lists of species  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:22):**  that are available to us as growers that we can plant.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:27):**  And keep in mind that our focus has been on what works  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:35):**  and not necessarily if it will sprout and grow,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:39):**  but will it sprout, grow and accomplish our goals?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:44):**  And so what I found in those lists were,  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:47):**  it was very difficult for me to find anybody in orchards  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:52):**  that was doing what we were doing.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:55):**  There was few, if any, there was nobody I knew of  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:59):**  that I could call and talk to  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:00):**  and have an in-depth conversation  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:02):**  about what species are you planting,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:04):**  because I didn't know of anybody that was doing this.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:08):**  There were people that were just like me,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:10):**  would plant a cover crop in a fallow field,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:13):**  but there was nobody that was planting it in the alleyway.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:16):**  So what I did, John, was I took the species that grew  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:22):**  the best in the fallow fields  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:25):**  and tried them in the alleyways.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:28):**  And what I found was that not every species did well.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:34):**  In fact, most species didn't do well,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:36):**  but the species that we landed on  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:38):**  that did do a good job in the alleyways  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:41):**  really do do a good job.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:43):**  I can talk about those specifically if you'd like.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:49):**  Yeah, what did you find to have that level of success?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:52):**  So for us, the mix that we really like in our alleyways  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:02):**  is a mix of annual rye,  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:05):**  which all the row crop growers are maybe cringing  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:07):**  when I say that, but it's not a problem for us.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:11):**  And our perennial system, we put in a mix of annual rye,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:16):**  triticale, and then a mustard species,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:22):**  a forage kale, a hybrid forage kale, and tillage radish.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:29):**  Those species work really, really well for us.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:35):**  And you might notice that I didn't name a legume  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:38):**  in that mix, and that is because we had difficulty  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:43):**  finding a legume that would work in this application.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:47):**  And we tried lots and lots of different legumes,  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:51):**  and we never were able to find one that worked for us.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:55):**  But the other thing was that we found  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:58):**  is when we were evaluating legumes in our fallow fields  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:02):**  and in our alleyways, voles and gophers  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:06):**  would become a real issue for us.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:09):**  They were very attracted to the legumes.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:12):**  And so I avoided those because we didn't find one  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:15):**  that worked well, and the vole and gopher problem  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:19):**  they generated was a big deal to us.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:23):**  Yeah, I understand that that is a major deal  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:26):**  for a lot of tree fruit production.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:28):**  But then also when you say that you didn't find a legume  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:31):**  that worked well for you, what were the other things  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:34):**  that worked well for you? What were the parameters  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:37):**  and the characteristics that you were looking for?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:38):**  Was it just because of slippery slopes,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:41):**  or what were the constraints on legumes  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:43):**  other than the gophers and the voles?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:46):**  Okay, so we evaluated a lot of different clover species,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:52):**  and what we found was that we just didn't get them  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:57):**  to establish well and grow for us consistently.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:04):**  When we talk about having a return on our investment,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:07):**  we need to have every seed that goes into that mix  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:11):**  be there because we know it's gonna earn us a return,  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:16):**  not because we want to feel good,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:19):**  feel that we're maybe doing something  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:20):**  that we read in a book was important.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:22):**  And so we just did not have consistent stands  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:28):**  of clovers established for us.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:33):**  We found that vetch could work for us.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:39):**  It would establish and it would grow  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:40):**  and it would be of benefit,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:42):**  but here's where the catch comes in.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:44):**  Vetch is not very well behaved at staying in the alleyway.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:48):**  It would take advantage of that nice open space  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:53):**  underneath the tree where it didn't have competition  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:56):**  from its companions in the alleyway,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:00):**  and it would grow into the tree row,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:03):**  which would be fine until it would encounter  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:07):**  a micro sprinkler.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:08):**  We irrigate almost all of our acres.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:11):**  Well, we irrigate all of our acres by drip  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:14):**  or micro sprinkler irrigation.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:16):**  And so when that vetch vine would encounter  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:19):**  the micro sprinkler, it would whip up around it  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:22):**  and it would make the micro sprinkler be ineffective  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:27):**  because the sprinkler would be covered in vetch.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:30):**  And so because I couldn't make vetch pave,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:33):**  I was forced to eliminate it from our mix.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:38):**  Got it.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:40):**  Which actually leads me to another question  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:43):**  that I had wanted to ask is,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:45):**  have you considered growing any cover crops in the tree row?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:48):**  Is that a possibility?  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:51):**  Boy, that is,  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:55):**  that's something that I would love to have happen for us.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:00):**  And it seems so incredibly simple to say,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:07):**  why can't we just grow something in the tree row?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:11):**  But yet it is incredibly, incredibly complicated  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:17):**  to find something that works.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:20):**  I have tried countless species and countless mixes  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:27):**  to grow underneath our trees in the tree row  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:32):**  and have yet to find one that works really well.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:35):**  And I'm sure that people are sitting listening right now  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:38):**  thinking, oh my gosh, what do you mean?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:41):**  Just look at all those things that you could plant.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:46):**  But it is very difficult to find a plant  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:50):**  that stays low enough, it does not interfere  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:53):**  with our micro sprinkler irrigation.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:57):**  And that can grow well in areas of the tree row  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:03):**  that are in full sun, full blazing sun  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:07):**  for the entire duration of the day,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:11):**  and yet can grow right up to the trunk of the tree,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:14):**  which may be full shade  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:16):**  for almost the entire duration of the day.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:19):**  And then probably most importantly,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:22):**  compete with weeds that grow in a tree row  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:27):**  that we unfortunately can't allow to be there  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:30):**  because of the micro sprinkler irrigation.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:32):**  I have just not come up with that species yet.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:38):**  And also a species that can survive being buried  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:41):**  in underneath the mow and blow mulch and still emerge  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:45):**  and remain short while doing all those things.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:48):**  Yes, and have a foot traffic of,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:52):**  there's not a lot of foot traffic in the tree row,  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:55):**  except during harvest, we have hundreds,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:59):**  we have several hundred people that enter a small block.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:02):**  Those people have to, I'm gonna use a technical term,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:06):**  trump around the tree to get the fruit picked.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:09):**  And that tramples a lot of cover crops.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:14):**  And so the list of requirements that we have for a plant,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:20):**  I have not found yet that accomplishes everything.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:24):**  We can get things that grow beautiful  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:28):**  underneath young trees, baby trees  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:31):**  that don't have a big canopy and that aren't in production.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:35):**  But as soon as those trees get up and start to shade,  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:38):**  as soon as we start having pruning activity going on,  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:41):**  we would tramp those cover crops down.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:44):**  Then the mow and blow brings a whole new dynamic  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:47):**  because there's nothing that I have found  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:50):**  that will not interfere with the micro sprinklers  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:55):**  that can take that mulch getting put on top.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:59):**  Challenging set of conditions for certain.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:01):**  So I'm open to any ideas to the listener community  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:07):**  out there for your podcast.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:09):**  But if there's something that you've tried  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:12):**  and it works for you, please let me know about it.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:16):**  There are a couple of species that do, I'm gonna say, okay,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:21):**  but to plant hundreds of acres of them is impossible  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:26):**  because of the nature of, you know,  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:29):**  they may be a tuber or they may be a bulb,  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:31):**  or we may need to start them as a small potted plant.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:36):**  Well, that's practical under a few trees  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:38):**  and in a backyard scenario, or maybe a very small orchard.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:43):**  But when you talk about hundreds or thousands of acres,  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:46):**  you could be talking about millions of plants  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:49):**  that you can't find a horticultural nursery  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:51):**  that could produce them economically for you.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:55):**  And it's a real challenge.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:58):**  Another thing is I found some species  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:01):**  that I thought were great,  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:04):**  but after we got a foot of snow on the ground,  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:08):**  the gophers and voles also thought that they were great  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:11):**  and they were gone come spring.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:13):**  An interesting set of challenging conditions.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:16):**  Mike, can you tell us a little bit about  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:17):**  some of the species that you experimented with  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:20):**  that were tubers or potted plants that worked okay?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:24):**  Yes, I can.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:27):**  There are three of them that did a good job  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:31):**  that we just aren't able to scale effectively.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:35):**  One of them is a Juga.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:39):**  The Latin name escapes me,  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:41):**  or your listeners, excuse me, will have to Google it.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:43):**  I didn't come prepared with the Latin name,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:46):**  but a Juga is one of the species that worked well.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:50):**  We planted not the variegated types or anything,  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:53):**  the fancy ones, just the wild type, if you will.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:57):**  The second plant is moneywort.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:59):**  That worked quite well.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:02):**  Again, it was just something  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:03):**  that was impossible for us to scale.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:06):**  And then the third species is a non-hybrid comfrey  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:11):**  that we found worked very nicely.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:18):**  Again, I don't remember the Latin name of it.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:24):**  I could maybe send that to you,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:26):**  and you could include it in the description  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:28):**  for this podcast, John.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:30):**  But it was sold as the common name European comfrey,  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:35):**  although looking at it,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:36):**  it looks different than what I would consider  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:38):**  European comfrey, but that's what it was sold to us as.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:42):**  Got it.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:42):**  And we'll include the information on these various species  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:46):**  in the show notes for those of you listening.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:49):**  Thank you for sharing that, Mike.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:50):**  A few moments ago, before we began speaking  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:53):**  about your mow and blow and the cover crops  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:56):**  that you're growing, you mentioned that once you  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:59):**  had established a mulch,  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:01):**  you then also began putting on more nutrient applications  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:05):**  and biological inoculants and biostimulants  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:08):**  into the tree row.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:09):**  What, can you tell us a little bit about some of the things  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:11):**  that you've been using, new tools that you've adopted,  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:14):**  and the results that you've observed?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:17):**  I sure can.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:19):**  So I started the process of focusing on the soil.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:24):**  Maybe many folks have done the same thing,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:26):**  but this is what I did, is I started to put on  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:31):**  every biological biostimulant and inoculant  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:35):**  that was available and seeing what worked.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:39):**  And what I found was that there are, of course,  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:42):**  like one would expect products that work better than others.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:46):**  But what I really learned was that hindsight is indeed 2020.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:53):**  And I found that by spraying inoculants onto the bare soil  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:00):**  as we were maintaining our alleyways,  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:02):**  just didn't make sense to me without having material there  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:08):**  to protect everything that you're putting on,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:12):**  to feed everything that you're putting on,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:13):**  it didn't make sense.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:15):**  And so what I began doing is I began, as I mentioned,  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:20):**  to put on material before and after my mulch,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:27):**  because there are some things I wanted to be covered  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:30):**  by the mulch and in contact with the soil.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:33):**  And there are other things that I wanted to have  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:36):**  go on top of the mulch and add some biological horsepower  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:42):**  to the natural processes and kickstart the natural processes  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:47):**  of breaking down that mulch and having it go to work  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:50):**  for us in the soil.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:54):**  So one of the things that I began doing is using a lot  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:58):**  of fish product and landed upon a product  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:02):**  that I really liked that's made with salmon  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:07):**  and crab material that's available here on the West Coast.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:12):**  That product I found really, really pushed forward  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:17):**  our soil efforts, our soil enhancement efforts.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:20):**  And we saw direct benefit in the crop.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:24):**  We could go as simple as having an orchard  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:27):**  where it's conventionally managed,  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:30):**  but we applied this fish product onto the soil  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:34):**  and onto the foliage of the trees.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:36):**  And that would be the only difference.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:38):**  And we saw a big return on our investment there,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:40):**  substantial return on our investment.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:43):**  We tried lots of other fish products.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:46):**  As you know, there are many of them available in the market  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:50):**  and some of them work better than others.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:52):**  But the one that we found that was made with salmon  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:56):**  and crab here from the West Coast, boy,  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:59):**  that really pushed us forward a lot in our efforts.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:04):**  And that was one of the baseline or base components  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:08):**  to all my nutrition programs now is using that fish.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:14):**  When you refer to that as the base  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:16):**  of your nutrition programs,  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:17):**  what other nutritional applications are you doing today  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:20):**  and how have those shifted over the last decade  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:23):**  or since you've started experimenting?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:25):**  We use nutrition as it's necessary now.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:30):**  And we're able to do that because we utilize a technique  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:35):**  to monitor what's going on in our orchard in real time  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:40):**  throughout the entire season.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:42):**  And that technique is SAP analysis.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:46):**  For many years, I did my nutrition program  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:51):**  about January or February.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:54):**  I would sit down and I would look at all of the returns  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:57):**  that we had for our orchard for size and price.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:01):**  I would then look at maybe a couple of leaf samples  
**[0:44:07-0:44:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:07):**  that we'd pulled during the growing season,  
**[0:44:09-0:44:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:09):**  maybe a soil sample.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:11):**  And I'd write down on a piece of paper  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:13):**  everything I was going to do for the following season.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:17):**  And we would follow that recipe.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:19):**  And we would make minor tweaks depending upon  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:22):**  what the size of the crop was.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:24):**  If we were gonna have a light yield  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:26):**  or an average yield or a heavy yield,  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:29):**  maybe we would have a disease problem  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:32):**  that started developing so we'd boost a nutrient or two.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:36):**  But we essentially would just follow what was written down  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:39):**  on the back of the envelope this time of year.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:41):**  We'd follow that through the entire season.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:44):**  Eight months from when the time something was written down,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:48):**  we were doing it.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:49):**  Well, orchards or any farm is not a static system.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:54):**  And there is all kinds of in season changes that occur  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:01):**  that need, that require us to change our approach  
**[0:45:05-0:45:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:05):**  in nutrition, what we're doing.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:08):**  And there was no technology that I had confidence in  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:13):**  available until sap analysis for knowing what was going on  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:19):**  right now in my orchard.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:21):**  So every two weeks, we take a sample from the time  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:26):**  that the first leaves are expanded until  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:29):**  right before a leaf drop.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:31):**  So the entire growing season of our orchard,  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:35):**  we are sampling.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:37):**  We're sending those samples in,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:38):**  we're getting the result back,  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:40):**  and we are calibrating every nutrient application  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:44):**  that we put on based upon those samples.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:47):**  Because we have a real time picture of what our trees  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:51):**  have need for or what they have excess of.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:56):**  So every nutrient in every tank is there  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:01):**  because the sap analysis has indicated it needs to be.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:06):**  So it's very difficult for me to give you general information  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:09):**  or for me to give you generalities, John.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:12):**  You know, I would love to do that.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:13):**  I'd love to say that our nutrient program is based on X,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:18):**  Y, and Z, but I really honestly can only say that fish  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:23):**  is something that is in virtually every application.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:27):**  What else is gonna be there depends upon what the results  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:31):**  of the sap analysis is.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:33):**  Obviously, Mike, if you're measuring and using sap analysis  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:36):**  and you're customizing, then there's the possibility  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:39):**  that your nutrient applications are very transient.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:43):**  They're shifting and changing all the time  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:44):**  and there aren't any constants except as you just indicated,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:48):**  the one constant of being a liquid fish application.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:52):**  One question that I have is how similar  
**[0:46:57-0:47:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:57):**  are your current types of nutrient applications  
**[0:47:00-0:47:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:00):**  to what they might have been  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:01):**  before you were using sap analysis?  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:03):**  Are there still general similarities?  
**[0:47:04-0:47:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:04):**  Were you applying similar trace minerals there?  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:07):**  Or perhaps a different way of asking the question would be,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:10):**  what were the changes that sap analysis indicated  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:13):**  that really surprised you or that were unexpected?  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:16):**  That's a great question, John.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:17):**  I'll give you some examples.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:20):**  I mean, before I started doing sap analysis,  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:23):**  I would put on semi loads of triple 20 foliar fertilizer.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:31):**  I would put on large amounts of zinc in the spring  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:36):**  thinking that the trees needed zinc  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:39):**  in order to generate bigger leaves  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:41):**  because we all know that bigger leaves on the tree  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:44):**  mean more carbohydrates being generated for the tree  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:48):**  to size those cherries and that's what our goal is.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:51):**  So I'd put on lots of triple 20 and lots of zinc.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:55):**  And what I found was that I was shooting myself in the foot  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:01):**  because my trees did not need zinc.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:04):**  They did not need triple 20 because the potassium  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:10):**  that I was applying in that triple 20  
**[0:48:13-0:48:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:13):**  was pushing calcium out of my trees.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:16):**  So when we started doing sap analysis,  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:20):**  I found myself putting on oodles and oodles of calcium  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:24):**  and no triple 20 because the trees had become  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:27):**  deficit in calcium.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:30):**  And over time, I was putting on more calcium.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:34):**  I was putting on more sodium than I ever could have  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:36):**  possibly imagined.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:38):**  And I was putting on no potassium  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:41):**  and no very little if any zinc.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:45):**  And that was a big surprise to me  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:46):**  because our baseline program was actually harming  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:52):**  our genetic potential of the trees  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:55):**  to generate the returns that we want.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:58):**  And that was a surprise to me.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:00):**  I would have known that I was actually taking away  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:04):**  from the potential of the tree  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:07):**  unless I had done sap analysis.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:09):**  So that was a big surprise.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:12):**  But things change.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:16):**  I think it was Bill Gates who said something like,  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:20):**  people generally overestimate what they can do in one year  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:25):**  and underestimate what they can do in 10 years.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:28):**  And I kind of love that saying because  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:34):**  as we've gone through time,  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:37):**  we see things happening in a sap analysis  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:41):**  that are surprising.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:43):**  And so for example, I was mentioning that we applied  
**[0:49:46-0:49:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:46):**  lots and lots of calcium  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:48):**  when we first started this process years ago.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:53):**  What we see now is actually our calcium levels,  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:57):**  for example, in 2018,  
**[0:49:59-0:50:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:59):**  our calcium levels were actually quite good.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:02):**  I never thought I would have said that  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:04):**  given the challenge of how much calcium we've put on.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:08):**  But the various activities that we've been doing  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:11):**  with focusing on our soil  
**[0:50:13-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:13):**  and our foliar nutrition based on sap analysis,  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:17):**  we've gotten our calcium levels up  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:19):**  to where I'm comfortable with them.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:21):**  And believe it or not,  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:23):**  I'd never thought I would say this in a million years,  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:27):**  we actually had a difficult time  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:30):**  with keeping our nitrogen levels  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:34):**  in the last growing season at a point where we needed them.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:38):**  I found myself actually putting on a large amount of nitrogen  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:43):**  relative to what we've done in the past  
**[0:50:45-0:50:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:45):**  because our nitrogen levels weren't high.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:48):**  We needed them to be higher.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:50):**  And boy, that was a big surprise.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:55):**  But again, I never would have done the right thing  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:58):**  and put on nitrogen  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:00):**  and backed off of our calcium applications  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:03):**  had I not had the sap analysis right there in front of me,  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:06):**  showing me the trends in those two nutrients  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:10):**  and having me be able to take action to correct them.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:15):**  We've certainly observed that sap analysis  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:17):**  and adapting to sap analysis  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:19):**  is one of the hallmarks of success  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:21):**  of really exceptional growers  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:23):**  because if you're not testing and if you're not measuring,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:27):**  then you're just guessing.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:29):**  And there are many growers  
**[0:51:31-0:51:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:31):**  who have historically been comfortable with guessing  
**[0:51:33-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:33):**  and that's rapidly shifting and changing.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:37):**  Boy, it sure is.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:40):**  And there probably are growers out there  
**[0:51:43-0:51:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:43):**  that are so in tuned with their crop  
**[0:51:46-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:46):**  that they might be able to look  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:49):**  and be lucky by having the guest be successful.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:53):**  And then they tell themselves that they're never wrong.  
**[0:51:56-0:51:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:56):**  And boy, that's a mistake.

**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:54:50):**  That leads to the question that I've been wanting to ask Mike.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:54:53):**  We started this conversation based on  
**[0:54:56-0:54:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:54:56):**  and answering the question is where are the opportunities  
**[0:54:59-0:55:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:54:59):**  to have a large return on capital, return on management?  
**[0:55:03-0:55:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:03):**  You described some of the challenges  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:04):**  that you've had in the orchard industry  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:07):**  in competing with the mainstream.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:11):**  And you mentioned that the foundational place  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:13):**  where you would start is with keeping the soil covered  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:17):**  with mow and blow, with mulches, et cetera.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:20):**  And you also mentioned nutrient applications,  
**[0:55:22-0:55:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:22):**  but you haven't spoken about the return on investment,  
**[0:55:25-0:55:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:25):**  return on capital management, et cetera  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:28):**  for foliar applications and these nutrient applications

**[0:55:32-0:55:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:32):**  How do those compare with the use of soil covers?  
**[0:55:37-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:37):**  I think that there is,  
**[0:55:42-0:55:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:42):**  there's a synergistic effect between mulches  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:47):**  and the foliar applications that we're doing on our crop.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:54):**  The lands that I farm, my family lands that I farm  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:58):**  have been in my family for over a hundred years  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:01):**  and they've been farmed for well over a hundred years.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:06):**  They are not native undisturbed soils.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:11):**  They are heavily utilized soils that have had over time,  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:20):**  a lot of tons of crop taken off them,  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:22):**  a lot of activities that may have been  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:27):**  in hindsight harmful to the soil.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:30):**  We're in a restorative process in our system.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:35):**  If I had virgin perfect soil to begin with,  
**[0:56:41-0:56:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:41):**  the foliar program that I need to apply now  
**[0:56:45-0:56:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:45):**  may not be necessary because the soil might potentially  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:49):**  could be providing everything that the plant needs.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:53):**  That sort of sounds like the Garden of Eden for plants.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:57):**  Instead, what I have is I have tired old soils  
**[0:57:02-0:57:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:02):**  that we need to restore.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:06):**  If I were to do that only with mulches  
**[0:57:09-0:57:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:09):**  and covering the soil up and mowing, blowing our cover crop,  
**[0:57:14-0:57:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:14):**  as patient a person I am,  
**[0:57:16-0:57:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:16):**  because I view this as a long game, I'm not that patient.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:21):**  I don't know if in my working lifetime,  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:25):**  we would be able to accomplish what I want to accomplish  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:28):**  and have the economic return that I wanna have  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:31):**  just by mowing and blowing mulches onto the soils.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:37):**  I think you said this, John,  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:39):**  one of the fastest ways for us to improve our soils  
**[0:57:43-0:57:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:43):**  is to have the crop that's growing in them  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:45):**  be doing the improvement for us.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:48):**  And so I view the tree as the conduit for putting carbon  
**[0:57:58-0:58:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:58):**  into our soils at a much higher rate  
**[0:58:00-0:58:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:00):**  than what I can do with mow and blow  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:03):**  and with applying mulches.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:05):**  Even if I were to truck hundreds and thousands  
**[0:58:08-0:58:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:08):**  of yards worth of mulch, wood mulch or compost mulch  
**[0:58:12-0:58:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:12):**  onto my soil, I really couldn't accomplish  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:16):**  as much as that tree does.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:18):**  And so I view the nutrient applications as twofold.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:25):**  One is that, of course, with nutrient applications  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:29):**  and calibrating those based on sap analysis,  
**[0:58:33-0:58:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:33):**  I'm able to make sure that I get as close as I can  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:36):**  to the genetic maximum potential of the cherry  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:40):**  in the given climate that it's growing in for that season.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:44):**  And I'm able to do that by growing as big a leaves  
**[0:58:48-0:58:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:48):**  and as big a canopy on my tree as possible.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:52):**  The engine for sizing fruit is the canopy of the tree.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:58):**  And that means big leaves, lots of surface area.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:02):**  That can be accomplished much quicker  
**[0:59:06-0:59:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:06):**  with foliar applications than any mow and blow.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:09):**  I mow and blow a few times,  
**[0:59:11-0:59:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:11):**  a handful of times a year is when that mower is passing by.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:15):**  However, I can apply nutrients through foliar  
**[0:59:19-0:59:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:19):**  or through fertigation every couple of days,  
**[0:59:22-0:59:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:22):**  which is what we actually do in the case of fertigation.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:25):**  And I'm able to size those leaves up big.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:28):**  But the other thing that that big canopy does  
**[0:59:30-0:59:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:30):**  besides grow this year's crop is it invests in future crops  
**[0:59:37-0:59:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:37):**  by contributing carbon and other nutrients  
**[0:59:40-0:59:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:40):**  into the rhizosphere in building the soil.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:44):**  So the tree is simultaneously generating the crop  
**[0:59:48-0:59:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:48):**  that's going to pay the bills and put food on the table  
**[0:59:52-0:59:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:52):**  and money in the college fund for my kids.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:56):**  It's at the same time, it's putting its own bank  
**[1:00:01-1:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:01):**  into the soil and building its future.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:04):**  So the tree is building my future  
**[1:00:07-1:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:07):**  with the crop I'm gonna harvest.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:09):**  And it's also building its own future  
**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:11):**  by boosting nutrients into the soil.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:14):**  And I think that foliar applications  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:17):**  and fertigation applications that we do,  
**[1:00:19-1:00:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:19):**  those nutrients that we apply need to be viewed  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:23):**  as both near term and long term investment.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:27):**  And so we continue to do foliar and fertigation  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:32):**  onto our trees even after the crop has been picked  
**[1:00:37-1:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:37):**  because we're growing next year's crop.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:39):**  And so we fertigate and we apply foliar nutrition  
**[1:00:44-1:00:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:44):**  based on sap analysis that we continue  
**[1:00:47-1:00:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:47):**  even after the cherries are off the tree  
**[1:00:50-1:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:50):**  because we're growing future crops.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:53):**  Mike, you've been doing many different things.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:55):**  You've been composting for it.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:57):**  Now we learn about fertigation and foliar applications.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:01):**  And you've been talking about the returns  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:03):**  in very abstract terminology of return on investment, et cetera.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:08):**  Tell us about results.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:09):**  What has changed with your trees?  
**[1:01:11-1:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:11):**  We started this conversation by mentioning a desire  
**[1:01:14-1:01:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:14):**  to develop the root systems.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:16):**  What has changed with root systems?  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:17):**  What has changed with tree health?  
**[1:01:19-1:01:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:19):**  What have you actually observed in the field?  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:21):**  One of the things that I have some anecdotes  
**[1:01:26-1:01:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:26):**  and then I have some actual data to share.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:28):**  So we'll start with the anecdotes.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:30):**  In November of 2014,  
**[1:01:35-1:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:35):**  we had one of those once in a lifetime historic freezes  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:40):**  that you may have just experienced in Ohio, John, recently,  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:45):**  where in November, the lowest the temperature had been  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:49):**  was 43 degrees.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:52):**  And our trees generally go into dormancy about November,  
**[1:01:56-1:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:56):**  but it had been a very warm fall.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:59):**  And you might say early winter.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:02):**  And the trees were still actively growing.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:05):**  We hadn't had any acclimation of cold hardiness.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:10):**  And then we had an Arctic front come down  
**[1:02:13-1:02:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:13):**  and we went from lows of in the 40s  
**[1:02:18-1:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:18):**  to below zero in one day.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:22):**  And it stayed below zero.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:24):**  And here at my house, we had negative four degrees Fahrenheit.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:28):**  And the leaves on the trees just turned black,  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:35):**  just like a dahlia plant looks after the first frost.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:38):**  The leaves turned black and they just hung on the trees.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:43):**  And we had in our area,  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:46):**  several hundred acres of trees that just died.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:50):**  We had blocks where all the buds were frozen on the trees.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:55):**  But at that time, I was doing some comparison analysis  
**[1:02:59-1:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:59):**  between, I'm gonna say mulch  
**[1:03:02-1:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:02):**  and intensive bio-nutrition applications  
**[1:03:06-1:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:06):**  and conventional applications for management of the orchard.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:11):**  And so I had two orchards that were sitting  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:13):**  within a quarter mile of each other at the same elevation.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:17):**  One was on one side of a small canyon  
**[1:03:19-1:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:19):**  and one was on the other side of the small canyon.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:22):**  They were the same age and variety of trees  
**[1:03:24-1:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:24):**  same irrigation.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:25):**  The only difference between them  
**[1:03:28-1:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:28):**  was the nutrition management.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:30):**  One had been, had compost, had mulch,  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:34):**  had bio-intensive nutrition applied.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:38):**  And the other orchard was just  
**[1:03:40-1:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:40):**  a standard conventional orchard.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:43):**  After that freeze, all the trees  
**[1:03:46-1:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:46):**  in the conventional orchard were killed or were dead.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:50):**  They froze out the orchard.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:53):**  They froze out the entire canopy was killed.  
**[1:03:57-1:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:57):**  We could have regrown them from the roots  
**[1:03:59-1:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:59):**  but the trees were dead down to the soil.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:02):**  And they'd been killed.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:06):**  The entire orchard was smoked.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:09):**  There wasn't one tree that was left.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:11):**  When you went and cut bark, it was black underneath  
**[1:04:15-1:04:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:15):**  instead of bright green.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:17):**  And I had to remove that orchard that following spring.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:20):**  The orchard where we'd been following  
**[1:04:24-1:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:24):**  these bio-intensive practices, believe it or not,  
**[1:04:28-1:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:28):**  had 110% of a normal crop.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:33):**  So we actually picked 10% more fruit out of that orchard  
**[1:04:38-1:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:38):**  than we did the previous year.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:41):**  And that truly amazed me because I couldn't believe it.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:46):**  That difference was only due to the nutrition management  
**[1:04:52-1:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:52):**  and these other activities that we were doing.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:54):**  There was no other difference there.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:56):**  And that really shocked me.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:59):**  The other thing that we've observed over time  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:04):**  is a marked reduction in two pathogens  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:10):**  that are problems for us, two diseases  
**[1:05:12-1:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:12):**  that are problems for us in cherries.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:14):**  One of them is bacterial canker.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:17):**  Bacterial canker causes cherry trees to eventually die.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:23):**  They create a lot of gum.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:25):**  So they get a canker that has a swelling of sap  
**[1:05:28-1:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:28):**  under the bark.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:29):**  And then these cankers burst almost like a blister  
**[1:05:35-1:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:35):**  and sap oozes out of them.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:39):**  That disease is a particular challenge  
**[1:05:44-1:05:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:44):**  with certain varieties and certain rootstocks of trees.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:48):**  And we have to avoid certain varieties  
**[1:05:50-1:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:50):**  and certain rootstocks of trees  
**[1:05:53-1:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:53):**  because we just really can't get them to ever grow very well  
**[1:05:57-1:06:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:57):**  because the trees get plagued by bacterial canker.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:00):**  And if it doesn't wipe the orchard out,  
**[1:06:03-1:06:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:03):**  it takes enough trees out of the block  
**[1:06:06-1:06:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:06):**  that you lose the value of that block as an economic unit.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:10):**  So say 20% of the block maybe is killed by bacterial canker,  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:17):**  that remaining 80% can never perform  
**[1:06:20-1:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:20):**  at the level we need to remain competitive  
**[1:06:22-1:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:22):**  because you're missing 20% of the trees in there.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:25):**  And you can try to replant them,  
**[1:06:27-1:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:27):**  but the baby trees you put in to that existing block  
**[1:06:31-1:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:31):**  succumb to bacterial canker.  
**[1:06:34-1:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:34):**  So one of the challenges that I faced was this disease.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:38):**  And the consultant said,  
**[1:06:41-1:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:41):**  advancing eco-agriculture that I work with  
**[1:06:44-1:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:44):**  started to tell me that we should try  
**[1:06:47-1:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:47):**  to take on this disease of bacterial canker  
**[1:06:50-1:06:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:50):**  by focusing on the nutrition.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:53):**  And over time, we had an amazing transformation in the block  
**[1:06:59-1:07:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:59):**  that had significant amounts of bacterial canker.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:01):**  Enough I was going to take the block out.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:04):**  But I left it there because I didn't have anything to lose.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:08):**  And what we found was that the bacterial canker  
**[1:07:13-1:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:13):**  was actually eliminated from the block.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:16):**  It wasn't just reduced, it was actually eliminated.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:21):**  Virtually all of the trees in that block  
**[1:07:24-1:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:24):**  had one or more canker sites on them.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:26):**  Some were far worse than others,  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:28):**  but almost every tree had at least one canker on it growing.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:33):**  And what we found is,  
**[1:07:35-1:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:35):**  I think it was by the third or fourth year,  
**[1:07:38-1:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:38):**  we could not find bacterial canker in that block.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:42):**  I had neighbors coming to the block.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:45):**  I had extension staff and research pathologists  
**[1:07:50-1:07:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:50):**  from Oregon State coming to that block.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:52):**  And they could not believe the change in the block  
**[1:07:57-1:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:57):**  that there was not canker there.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:00):**  A second disease that's more problematic in cherries  
**[1:08:03-1:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:03):**  is powdery mildew.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:05):**  That disease affects the foliage and fruit.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:08):**  And it's a real challenge.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:10):**  Powdery mildew is the disease that is targeted  
**[1:08:15-1:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:15):**  by almost all of the fungicides applications  
**[1:08:18-1:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:18):**  that are applied in conventional  
**[1:08:21-1:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:21):**  and organic production of cherries.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:24):**  And what we've seen is that highly susceptible varieties  
**[1:08:28-1:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:28):**  that normally would require extra powdery mildew applications  
**[1:08:37-1:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:37):**  actually we've been able to reduce our applications by half.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:41):**  And maybe I could reduce them by more.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:44):**  I'm just a bit nervous about reducing them by more.  
**[1:08:47-1:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:47):**  But we have been able to apply half the number of fungicides  
**[1:08:52-1:08:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:52):**  to those trees and we have no mildew there.  
**[1:08:56-1:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:56):**  And this is another thing that neighbors couldn't believe.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:00):**  So we actually had a walking tour through that block  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:04):**  that was hosted by, well, we've had a couple of them.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:08):**  One of them was hosted by extension.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:11):**  And I made a bet with the neighbors there.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:14):**  I said, can you go find any mildew in this block  
**[1:09:19-1:09:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:19):**  and I'll buy you a steak dinner.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:21):**  Actually, I have never had to buy a steak dinner  
**[1:09:23-1:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:23):**  because folks cannot find mildew in that orchard.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:26):**  And a typical orchard with that variety on it  
**[1:09:30-1:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:30):**  would have lots of mildew  
**[1:09:32-1:09:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:32):**  because even with fungicide applications,  
**[1:09:34-1:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:34):**  we're not able to control it.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:36):**  So those are two things that we've observed  
**[1:09:40-1:09:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:40):**  that I honestly thought we would never get to  
**[1:09:46-1:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:46):**  where through nutrition,  
**[1:09:49-1:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:49):**  we're able to manage our diseases in this case  
**[1:09:54-1:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:54):**  with bacterial canker and with powdery mildew.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:00):**  I was really shocked by that.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:02):**  And to me, it speaks to the value to the tree  
**[1:10:06-1:10:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:06):**  in the long-term value to the orchard  
**[1:10:10-1:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:10):**  of providing the nutrition that the tree needs  
**[1:10:15-1:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:15):**  and the tree will take care of itself.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:18):**  Mike, these are some extraordinary anecdotes.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:20):**  Thank you very much for sharing them.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:22):**  I think I'm certainly inspired by hearing these stories  
**[1:10:25-1:10:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:25):**  because we've heard many of the leaders  
**[1:10:28-1:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:28):**  of the biological agriculture space saying for decades,  
**[1:10:32-1:10:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:32):**  I mean, William Albrecht back in the 1940s  
**[1:10:35-1:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:35):**  used to say that insects are nature's garbage collectors  
**[1:10:39-1:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:39):**  and diseases were here to take the unhealthy plants  
**[1:10:42-1:10:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:42):**  out of the system.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:43):**  So it's encouraging to hear  
**[1:10:44-1:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:44):**  that we can actually manage plant nutrition  
**[1:10:46-1:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:46):**  and produce these effects.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:49):**  You mentioned that you also have some data.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:51):**  I'm not sure what the data is in regards to,  
**[1:10:53-1:10:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:53):**  but I would also love to learn more about  
**[1:10:56-1:11:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:56):**  what were the effects that you observed in fruit itself?  
**[1:11:00-1:11:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:00):**  There's the health of the tree component,  
**[1:11:02-1:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:02):**  but how did managing nutrition affect fruit quality for you?  
**[1:11:06-1:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:06):**  That's a good question, John.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:08):**  It brings me back to the numbers.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:10):**  The anecdotes are always fun to talk about,  
**[1:11:13-1:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:13):**  but the data is too.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:15):**  So I believe in measuring and not just in sap analysis,  
**[1:11:22-1:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:22):**  of course, but I believe in measuring results  
**[1:11:27-1:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:27):**  of the management activities that we do on our farm.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:31):**  I think it's incredibly important for us to be observers.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:38):**  I think farmers need to be observers,  
**[1:11:41-1:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:41):**  but I also think that farmers need to be engineers  
**[1:11:48-1:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:48):**  in the fact that if we don't measure,  
**[1:11:51-1:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:51):**  we'll never really know for sure.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:54):**  So on our farm over the years,  
**[1:11:58-1:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:58):**  we collect lots of data and we continue to do so.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:01):**  And in particular, we collect data on the size  
**[1:12:05-1:12:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:05):**  and firmness of our cherries,  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:07):**  because those are the two primary criteria  
**[1:12:09-1:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:09):**  that base the price that we're gonna receive per pound  
**[1:12:13-1:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:13):**  for our fruit.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:14):**  And what we have consistently seen over time  
**[1:12:18-1:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:18):**  is that when we apply biointensive management practices,  
**[1:12:25-1:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:25):**  we have a higher quality of fruit in size and in firmness,  
**[1:12:32-1:12:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:32):**  because those are two easy things for us to measure  
**[1:12:36-1:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:36):**  because we can take a sample  
**[1:12:37-1:12:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:37):**  and we can measure the size and the firmness.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:40):**  And in general, across varieties  
**[1:12:44-1:12:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:44):**  and across management techniques,  
**[1:12:46-1:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:46):**  we can increase our fruit by one half row size consistently.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:55):**  And oftentimes we can boost our fruit by one row size,  
**[1:12:58-1:13:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:58):**  which is the gauge of which you measure cherry fruit size.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:02):**  We also have our fruit be significantly firmer,  
**[1:13:07-1:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:07):**  raising our firmness upwards of 50 to 100 grams  
**[1:13:13-1:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:13):**  per millimeter of pressure when we examine the fruit.  
**[1:13:18-1:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:18):**  So those two factors,  
**[1:13:20-1:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:20):**  we have rings of data on increasing our size and firmness.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:26):**  But what we have seen on a per acre basis  
**[1:13:31-1:13:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:31):**  is that we fairly consistently return,  
**[1:13:37-1:13:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:37):**  our net return on investment with these practices  
**[1:13:41-1:13:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:41):**  in cherries is somewhere between 800 and $2,100 per acre.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:48):**  It depends on the variety and it depends on the year.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:52):**  But that's the net difference in our return  
**[1:13:57-1:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:57):**  after we take our expenses of the biointensive practices out.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:01):**  When we back those out,  
**[1:14:03-1:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:03):**  if we look at what an acre of biointensive cherries returns  
**[1:14:08-1:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:08):**  versus an acre that we farm conventionally,  
**[1:14:11-1:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:11):**  we're consistently between $800 and $2,100 ahead  
**[1:14:17-1:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:17):**  as profit for ourselves.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:19):**  So those are real numbers and that really gets my attention.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:24):**  And I like it because it's good to do something  
**[1:14:30-1:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:30):**  that is interesting to me as a farmer, you know,  
**[1:14:34-1:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:34):**  and exciting, but also pays the bills and pays them well.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:38):**  That's a win-win.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:40):**  Mike, you've described some phenomenals,  
**[1:14:43-1:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:43):**  some extraordinary stories and anecdotes  
**[1:14:45-1:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:45):**  with the freeze protection, et cetera,  
**[1:14:47-1:14:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:47):**  of all those surprises that you've had on your journey  
**[1:14:51-1:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:51):**  as you've experimented with these various approaches.  
**[1:14:55-1:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:55):**  What was the most unexpected?  
**[1:14:58-1:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:58):**  You know, I'm gonna wrap you into this story, John.  
**[1:15:05-1:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:05):**  When you and I first met, however long ago it's been now,  
**[1:15:12-1:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:12):**  I remember I was incredibly impressed with your knowledge  
**[1:15:17-1:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:17):**  and really connected with you as a person and as a farmer.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:23):**  And I was just very, very in agreement  
**[1:15:28-1:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:28):**  with everything that you said  
**[1:15:30-1:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:30):**  as we had our many long conversations  
**[1:15:34-1:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:34):**  until you told me that I could reduce mildew  
**[1:15:40-1:15:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:40):**  and bacterial canker to zero.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:43):**  That's when I doubted you, John,  
**[1:15:47-1:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:47):**  because I thought never in a million years  
**[1:15:52-1:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:52):**  will that happen.  
**[1:15:54-1:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:54):**  And I had Albrecht's writings  
**[1:15:57-1:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:57):**  and the writings of many other pioneers  
**[1:16:00-1:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:00):**  that have come before you and me, John,  
**[1:16:02-1:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:02):**  not that I'm a pioneer, but you sure are.  
**[1:16:05-1:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:05):**  I always thought that they're drinking the Kool-Aid on that.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:11):**  That's never gonna happen.  
**[1:16:13-1:16:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:13):**  And boy, I was wrong and surprised  
**[1:16:18-1:16:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:18):**  when we were able to back that off.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:20):**  I was really confident we could make the fruit bigger.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:24):**  I was really confident that we could generate higher yields,  
**[1:16:27-1:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:27):**  which we've been able to do,  
**[1:16:29-1:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:29):**  but I never thought we'd knock down  
**[1:16:32-1:16:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:32):**  powdery mildew and bacterial canker.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:35):**  And I'm still cautious about them,  
**[1:16:37-1:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:37):**  but boy, that's probably the biggest surprise for sure, John.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:41):**  Good, well, thanks for the compliments contained within that.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:45):**  I know it's been a lot of fun for us to see that happening  
**[1:16:48-1:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:48):**  on your operation and others as well.  
**[1:16:50-1:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:50):**  So thank you for sharing that.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:52):**  Mike, there are many growers who are listening,  
**[1:16:54-1:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:54):**  many other fruit growers, vegetable growers.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:57):**  What is a book or resource that you would recommend  
**[1:17:01-1:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:01):**  that everyone needs to read to become more immersed  
**[1:17:04-1:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:04):**  or other things people need to consider  
**[1:17:06-1:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:06):**  that perhaps we haven't spoken about?  
**[1:17:08-1:17:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:08):**  Well, since you're asking one, I can't answer.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:12):**  So I'm gonna answer with two.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:16):**  YouTube has been invaluable to me.  
**[1:17:20-1:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:20):**  I think books, I love books,  
**[1:17:23-1:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:23):**  and every place where there's room for a book,  
**[1:17:26-1:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:26):**  there's one there, and I love to read  
**[1:17:29-1:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:29):**  and it's very important.  
**[1:17:31-1:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:31):**  But one of the hard things for me in books  
**[1:17:35-1:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:35):**  is by the time the book gets out there,  
**[1:17:38-1:17:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:38):**  I sometimes feel that maybe the information,  
**[1:17:41-1:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:41):**  the actionable information can become a bit dated.  
**[1:17:46-1:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:46):**  And so I use YouTube a lot.  
**[1:17:49-1:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:49):**  There is an amazing amount of information on YouTube.  
**[1:17:55-1:17:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:55):**  One of the things that we did  
**[1:17:57-1:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:57):**  to make that really effective active compost on our farm  
**[1:18:01-1:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:01):**  is introduced a lot of vermicompost techniques  
**[1:18:05-1:18:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:05):**  to that process.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:07):**  I learned that all on YouTube.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:10):**  Whether it's fabricating a piece of equipment  
**[1:18:12-1:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:12):**  or doing something a little different,  
**[1:18:14-1:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:14):**  YouTube is a great resource.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:17):**  But since I love books, I have to include a book  
**[1:18:23-1:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:23):**  and it might sound a little bit obtuse,  
**[1:18:26-1:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:26):**  but I love to read really old books  
**[1:18:30-1:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:30):**  from the 20s and 30s about how people ran their farms  
**[1:18:36-1:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:36):**  when they were where there were integrated livestock  
**[1:18:39-1:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:39):**  and row crop production together.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:43):**  And I really liked books that focus upon  
**[1:18:47-1:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:47):**  not just the love and romance of farming,  
**[1:18:50-1:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:50):**  but the business of farming from that era.  
**[1:18:53-1:18:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:53):**  And there's a great book that I love and I read it,  
**[1:18:57-1:19:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:57):**  oh, every year or two.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:00):**  And it's called The Farming Ladder.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:04):**  And it's written by a gentleman named Henderson  
**[1:19:08-1:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:08):**  and it describes his farm in England, Oat Hill Farm,  
**[1:19:13-1:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:13):**  and how they ran the farm.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:15):**  They had horses, they had poultry and cattle and sheep,  
**[1:19:20-1:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:20):**  and they cut hay and oats,  
**[1:19:22-1:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:22):**  and they had barns in it.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:25):**  And the focus in that book is just really, really neat  
**[1:19:29-1:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:29):**  because he talks about keys to his success  
**[1:19:34-1:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:34):**  in not just applying the art and love of farming,  
**[1:19:38-1:19:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:38):**  but the business aspects of farming.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:41):**  And I really enjoy that book.  
**[1:19:44-1:19:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:44):**  So I would suggest everybody find it on,  
**[1:19:48-1:19:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:48):**  I don't know if it's in reprint, I have an original,  
**[1:19:51-1:19:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:51):**  but you could get it.  
**[1:19:53-1:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:53):**  And I just enjoy that a great deal.  
**[1:19:57-1:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:57):**  Mike, I've read many, many books  
**[1:19:59-1:20:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:59):**  and there isn't often that someone recommends one  
**[1:20:02-1:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:02):**  in agriculture that I haven't read,  
**[1:20:04-1:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:04):**  but you've been successful.  
**[1:20:05-1:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:05):**  I'm going to be getting it and reading it  
**[1:20:07-1:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:07):**  as soon as I have the opportunity.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:10):**  Well, that's good.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:11):**  You'll enjoy it, John.  
**[1:20:13-1:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:13):**  Yeah, well, thanks for the recommendation.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:16):**  Mike, your views on orchard management  
**[1:20:20-1:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:20):**  and the attrition management have shifted  
**[1:20:22-1:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:22):**  as you've described over the course  
**[1:20:24-1:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:24):**  of the last decade or so.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:27):**  And there's this one question,  
**[1:20:28-1:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:28):**  which I think is very important for us to ask  
**[1:20:30-1:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:30):**  and to think about.  
**[1:20:32-1:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:32):**  Today, what is it that you believe to be true  
**[1:20:35-1:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:35):**  about modern agriculture, about modern fruit production  
**[1:20:39-1:20:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:39):**  that is perhaps different from the mainstream view?  
**[1:20:42-1:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:42):**  I think if I consider the mainstream view  
**[1:20:54-1:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:54):**  to be conventional agriculture,  
**[1:20:59-1:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:59):**  I think the thing that is different  
**[1:21:04-1:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:04):**  is that biologically intensive practices  
**[1:21:09-1:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:09):**  are not antagonistic to large scale agriculture.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:18):**  I don't believe that large scale agriculture  
**[1:21:23-1:21:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:23):**  and bio-intensive and regenerative practices  
**[1:21:27-1:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:27):**  are mutually exclusive.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:30):**  On my farm, we farmed 350 acres  
**[1:21:35-1:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:35):**  and we were able to implement practices  
**[1:21:42-1:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:42):**  that were done on people with a third of an acre  
**[1:21:47-1:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:47):**  that they had under production.  
**[1:21:49-1:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:49):**  We were able to scale that.  
**[1:21:51-1:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:51):**  We were able to find ways to make things work.  
**[1:21:55-1:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:55):**  And that is where the challenge lies,  
**[1:21:58-1:22:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:58):**  I think for us in this field,  
**[1:22:02-1:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:02):**  that people that have this passion is,  
**[1:22:05-1:22:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:05):**  if we really wanna have a substantial effect  
**[1:22:08-1:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:08):**  on world food production,  
**[1:22:11-1:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:11):**  we have to make a crude statement,  
**[1:22:14-1:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:14):**  bring in the big companies, the big acres,  
**[1:22:18-1:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:18):**  the big boys, if you will,  
**[1:22:20-1:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:20):**  if we really wanna have an impact.  
**[1:22:22-1:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:22):**  And I think that that can be done  
**[1:22:26-1:22:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:26):**  because these aren't mutually exclusive,  
**[1:22:29-1:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:29):**  regenerative farming, biologically intensive  
**[1:22:32-1:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:32):**  and large scale agriculture.  
**[1:22:34-1:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:34):**  They aren't and they don't have to be.  
**[1:22:37-1:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:37):**  But I think sometimes folks like to be members  
**[1:22:40-1:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:40):**  of a tribe or a point of view  
**[1:22:45-1:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:45):**  where when someone walks in the room  
**[1:22:48-1:22:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:22:48):**  who say is of industrial scale agriculture, if you will,

### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 16:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:52):**  all other growing systems are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:05):**  and when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:11):**  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:14):**  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:17):**  please connect on social media

**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:28):**  Hope you enjoy, and thank you for listening.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:31):**  This episode was originally recorded as a webinar,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:34):**  which is why you might notice audio quality is a bit lower.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:38):**  Growers expressed a lot of appreciation  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:40):**  for the observations I shared,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:41):**  which is why I also wanted to share it with you  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:43):**  here on the podcast.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:45):**  Well, good evening, friends.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:46):**  Thank you for joining us.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:48):**  I will be talking about a slightly different topic  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:50):**  from those that I normally speak of,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:53):**  where I'm normally talking about agronomics.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:56):**  A number of growers have asked me to repeat a presentation  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:02):**  that I first talked about at the World Ag Expo  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:04):**  a couple of years ago,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:05):**  where I was asked to talk about the characteristics  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:09):**  of exceptional farm managers,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:11):**  and it separates those farm managers  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:12):**  who have an exceptional degree of success.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:15):**  The context and the history behind this  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:17):**  is in some of the work that we've done  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:19):**  at Advancing Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:22):**  When we first started with our initial consulting work  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:26):**  and then started product development work,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:28):**  one of our practices was that every year  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:31):**  at the end of a growing season,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:33):**  we would sit down with all of our consultants  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:36):**  around the table and we would rank the success,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:40):**  not in terms of necessarily in terms of  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:41):**  the growers management success or financial success  
**[0:02:44-0:02:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:44):**  or anything like that,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:44):**  but more specifically in terms of their agronomic success.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:48):**  How successful were we in producing the yield levels  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:52):**  that we thought should be possible?  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:54):**  And what was working?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:56):**  What was not working?  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:58):**  It's a very fascinating exercise.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:59):**  So we would rank the agronomic performance  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:02):**  of the crops that we were working with  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:03):**  on a scale of one to 10.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:05):**  And then we would group the nines and tens together,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:10):**  the ones and twos together,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:11):**  and we would ask what are the similarities  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:13):**  between the nines and tens?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:15):**  What characteristics do these farm managers share in common  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:20):**  that are quite different from the rest,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:23):**  most of the rest of the group?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:24):**  And similarly with the ones and twos,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:27):**  what are the common characteristics amongst those farms  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:30):**  that are not enjoying the level of success?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:33):**  So this was a fascinating exercise  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:34):**  and we've repeated the same exercise  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:36):**  year after year after year,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:38):**  and we learned an awful lot.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:41):**  We learned a lot about agronomy.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:43):**  If I recall correctly, it was 2011 or 12,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:46):**  where we realized that all of the growers  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:50):**  or most of the growers in the number one  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:53):**  and number two category who were not enjoying  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:55):**  the degree of agronomic success  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:57):**  that we thought should be possible  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:59):**  were making foliar applications with poor quality water.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:04):**  And so that was kind of our first revelation  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:09):**  of how extremely important water quality is  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:13):**  for foliar applications of nutrients.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:17):**  However, over the last four years  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:21):**  that we have repeated this exercise,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:24):**  all of a sudden the differences that started showing up  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:26):**  were no longer differences about agronomics.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:28):**  They were no longer differences of, for example,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:31):**  using hard water or poor quality water  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:34):**  for foliar applications.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:35):**  Instead, the differences that started showing up  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:39):**  were differences in the management characteristics  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:41):**  of how were growers managing their operation.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:45):**  So we developed a group of core characteristics  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:51):**  that describe this group of very successful farm managers.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:57):**  Things happen to these growers as well,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:58):**  environment and climate impacts  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:00):**  that are beyond their control,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:02):**  but consistently side by side,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:05):**  when compared with growers growing the exact same crops,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:07):**  the exact same neighborhood,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:09):**  they consistently outperform those growers.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:12):**  What are the characteristics that those growers share  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:14):**  and why does that happen?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:16):**  Well, perhaps one of the biggest pieces  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:20):**  that really stood out was how they thought about money  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:27):**  and the finances on their farm  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:29):**  and how that influenced their behavior and their priorities,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:33):**  because they prioritized their personal time and energy  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:36):**  and the things they learned about completely differently  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:39):**  based on their interactions with money  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:44):**  and how they thought about managing money  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:46):**  and managing the finances on the farm.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:49):**  Obviously, as we know, agriculture and farming  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:52):**  is a challenging profession.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:54):**  For most of the crops that we're growing,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:55):**  we're talking about very large volumes, very tight margins.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:59):**  There's not a lot of room to wiggle margin-wise  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:02):**  and we need to manage costs very carefully,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:08):**  but we observed that there was a strong polarity  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:12):**  in the way that they thought  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:13):**  about managing their farm's balance sheet.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:16):**  If you want to balance a budget on any enterprise,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:20):**  then you have two major categories that you can play with.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:24):**  You can focus on increasing revenues  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:26):**  or you can focus on reducing costs.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:30):**  And obviously, in the agriculture environment,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:33):**  you can't ignore either of those.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:34):**  You have to pay close attention to costs.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:37):**  You have to pay very close attention to revenues.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:40):**  But we discovered the most successful farm managers  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:44):**  thought about these two categories completely differently  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:47):**  from most of the growers that we were working with.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:50):**  Most growers became personally engaged  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:54):**  and spent a lot of their personal time  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:56):**  and personal energy managing costs.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:00):**  They focused very heavily on the cost side of the budget  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:03):**  and reducing costs, reducing inputs.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:07):**  They made that their personal responsibility.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:10):**  From a financial perspective,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:11):**  that is where they spent perhaps 80% of their personal focus  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:14):**  on the financial spectrum.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:16):**  Increasing revenues is an area  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:20):**  that the less successful farm managers  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:22):**  spent a little bit of time on,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:24):**  but in this area, they would delegate a lot.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:28):**  So they would delegate to crop consultants  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:32):**  and to veterinarians, to agronomists,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:35):**  to make recommendations for what nutrients to be applied  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:39):**  or what cover crops to be planted  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:41):**  or whatever the case might be  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:43):**  to look at various tools and practices  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:45):**  that they might be able to use to increase revenue.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:47):**  So they would invest personally,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:51):**  perhaps 20% of their own time and energy  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:53):**  focusing on increasing revenue  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:55):**  and 80% of their personal energy on reducing costs.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:00):**  This was in stark contrast to the most successful growers.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:05):**  The most successful growers  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:08):**  would do the exact opposite, managing costs.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:10):**  They would delegate that to their accountants,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:13):**  to their farm managers.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:14):**  They didn't ignore it.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:16):**  They still stayed on top of it.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:17):**  They still paid close attention.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:19):**  They made sure that they were on track,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:21):**  but they delegated most of the responsibility  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:23):**  and the priorities.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:24):**  But on the side of increasing revenue,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:28):**  they made sure that they understood  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:32):**  how to increase revenue on the farm personally, very deeply.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:37):**  They absolutely categorically refused  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:40):**  to delegate that responsibility to anyone else.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:44):**  In fact, this was so pronounced,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:45):**  I think this is a characteristic  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:46):**  that's worth talking about for a little bit.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:48):**  For every crop, even if you're growing a commodity crop  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:51):**  like corn or soybeans,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:53):**  there are always a number of key pieces  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:57):**  that directly affect revenue.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:01):**  If you are growing blueberries, for example,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:05):**  then the value of your blueberry crop,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:08):**  particularly if you are shipping it  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:10):**  for an extended distance,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:12):**  is based on size and firmness.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:16):**  In some parts of the country,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:17):**  and you get premiums for firmness.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:20):**  If you're growing wheat, for example,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:22):**  you get premiums in many parts of the country  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:24):**  for producing higher protein content wheat.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:27):**  With commodity crops such as corn,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:29):**  you get premiums for producing high test weight corn,  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:32):**  or in some cases on soybeans, high oil content.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:36):**  My point is simply that for most crops,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:38):**  there are key quality characteristics  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:42):**  that bring a premium either directly or indirectly.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:46):**  The question these very successful growers ask themselves  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:51):**  is how do I make money with this crop?  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:55):**  They understand these quality characteristics,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:58):**  whether it's increased firmness, increased protein content,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:00):**  increased test weight, whatever the characteristic might be.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:03):**  And they make certain that they personally know  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:07):**  and understand that specific characteristic very deeply.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:14):**  They do not delegate that to anyone else.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:16):**  They don't delegate that knowledge to a consultant  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:19):**  or an agronomist or an advisor.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:21):**  They certainly have consultants and agronomists  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:23):**  and advisors and people on their team that they work with,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:26):**  but they want to make sure that they understand  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:29):**  that specific piece personally.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:32):**  So in terms of the economics and the finances of their farm,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:36):**  the most successful growers spend roughly 20%  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:39):**  of their personal energy thinking about reducing costs  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:42):**  and 80% of their time and energy  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:44):**  thinking about how to increase revenue.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:48):**  They delegate most of the cost side,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:50):**  and they personally take responsibility  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:52):**  for the revenue side.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:53):**  This is an exact opposite to the less successful growers.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:58):**  So this was one that really stood out very, very strongly.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:01):**  The second piece that really stood out  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:05):**  was the difference in implementation and execution.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:10):**  The most successful farm managers  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:13):**  demanded perfect implementation and execution  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:17):**  from themselves and also from their employees.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:21):**  And obviously talking about an industry  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:23):**  where things always go wrong,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:25):**  but when it came to developing infrastructure on a farm,  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:28):**  trellising trees, putting up a hoop house,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:31):**  putting on a foliar application, setting pipe for irrigation,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:34):**  whatever activity was needed or necessary,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:38):**  they expected perfect execution.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:40):**  The rows needed to be perfectly straight  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:42):**  or perfectly on contour.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:44):**  They demanded the best of execution,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:46):**  both of themselves and of their employees.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:50):**  Another difference was their planning  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:54):**  for the future of their operation  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:56):**  and the things that they wanted to be working on.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:58):**  So the most successful managers we saw consistently  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:01):**  would be thinking into the future  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:04):**  and about projects that they wanted to work on in the future.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:06):**  So what a new type of trellising and managing trees  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:12):**  might look like in the future,  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:13):**  or new varieties for a crop that they're growing,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:18):**  like strawberries or tomatoes,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:20):**  and new types of growing systems.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:22):**  So they're constantly looking for new technology, new ideas,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:26):**  and they're thinking about where the industry that they're in  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:30):**  is going to be in three to five years from now or longer.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:34):**  So they're thinking into the future more longer term.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:38):**  And generally we find that the less successful growers  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:41):**  are thinking at the most about 12 to 18 months in advance  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:45):**  of what their crops they want to be growing  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:47):**  and what the future of those crops might be.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:51):**  There was another very interesting characteristic  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:53):**  that tied back to our first point of delegation  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:57):**  versus personal engagement in our increasing revenue  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:01):**  versus reducing costs.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:03):**  Once a grower identified the critical pieces,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:08):**  the critical points that had an impact on increasing revenue,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:13):**  they wanted to understand precisely what was happening  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:16):**  inside the plant from a physiological perspective.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:18):**  Are we talking about kernels  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:20):**  at a specific stage of kernel development?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:22):**  What influences that stage of kernel development?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:25):**  How can I change it?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:26):**  How can I increase test weight, protein content?  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:28):**  They would pay very close attention to those pieces.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:31):**  And then the extension from that is they would focus  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:37):**  on developing manageable data.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:42):**  When I say manageable data,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:44):**  what I mean is they would identify a specific point.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:48):**  So let's just say for the sake of discussion  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:50):**  that increasing protein content in wheat.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:54):**  After reading the literature  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:57):**  and speaking to a group of advisors and consultants,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:01):**  a farmer might identify that increasing protein content  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:05):**  on wheat is related to the mineral balance  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:08):**  of six key minerals  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:10):**  at a specific stage of plant development.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:12):**  I'm making up a hypothetical example.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:14):**  That grower would then make absolutely certain  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:17):**  rather than just saying,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:19):**  okay, I need to make sure that plants  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:21):**  have enough of these six minerals.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:22):**  I'm going to go out there and foliar feed all my acres  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:26):**  with these six nutrients just before this time period.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:30):**  They wouldn't take a blanket shotgun approach,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:32):**  but instead they would say, okay,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:35):**  how can I know exactly what the nutritional requirements are  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:39):**  of this plant at this stage of development?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:42):**  So I think a challenge that we have in parts of agriculture  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:47):**  is we develop a lot of data,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:49):**  but it doesn't necessarily transfer readily  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:52):**  into making management decisions.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:54):**  We can have all the data in the world,  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:56):**  but what do we do with it?  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:58):**  How can we transfer it  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:59):**  into actually making a difference on a farm?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:02):**  The most successful growers have no desire  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:04):**  to have a lot of data  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:05):**  just for the sake of having a lot of data.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:07):**  They want to have data about those specific points  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:10):**  that they know they can and need to influence  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:14):**  in order to increase revenue.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:16):**  So that is a major piece that they focus on very intensely.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:19):**  Another intriguing characteristic  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:22):**  of these exceptionally successful growers  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:25):**  was the amount of time they spent learning.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:29):**  Just in observations and watching them,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:32):**  I would suggest somewhere in the neighborhood  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:35):**  of about five to 10% of their time was spent learning,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:39):**  going attending conferences, going to field days,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:42):**  reading books, talking to people on the phone,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:45):**  all these various activities.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:47):**  They were constantly, they were very inquisitive  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:51):**  about learning new information  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:52):**  that would help them manage their crops better.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:55):**  Sometimes in agriculture,  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:58):**  it's a legacy business.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:01):**  And in that, many growers and many farmers  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:06):**  see it as much more than just the opportunity to make money.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:12):**  It's also their home, it's their family,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:16):**  and they have a strong desire to leave a legacy behind.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:19):**  And that is an incredibly valuable mindset  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:24):**  and mind frame from many different perspectives.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:27):**  However, it sometimes can lead to not wanting things  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:33):**  to change from the way they have been.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:35):**  Somebody sent me a quote recently  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:37):**  that kind of cracked me up a little bit.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:40):**  There are some people who are open to progress,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:44):**  but resistant to change.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:46):**  So they're open to having progress happen,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:49):**  but they don't personally want to change.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:51):**  They want it to happen to other people.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:52):**  This characteristic absolutely does not define  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:57):**  the most successful growers.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:59):**  These are growers that are extremely adaptable.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:03):**  In many cases, they are early adopters.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:05):**  They're constantly looking for new ideas  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:07):**  and new technologies that they can adopt  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:09):**  and implement on their operation.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:11):**  There is one mantra that we heard repeated  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:15):**  over and over again from these early adopters.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:19):**  They may have a bit more of an appetite to try new things.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:23):**  They're more comfortable with the risk of trying new things,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:26):**  conducting a pilot, running some trials,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:28):**  testing things on their own operation.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:30):**  This was a mantra that was quite common.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:33):**  Think big, start small, and scale fast.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:37):**  So when experimenting with new technologies and new ideas,  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:42):**  they might conduct a trial on a small part  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:45):**  of their total operation,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:47):**  but the moment it demonstrated performance and effectiveness,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:51):**  they would scale that very, very quickly  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:53):**  across their entire operation,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:55):**  where they might increase,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:56):**  they might go from 3% of their acres one year  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:01):**  to once they were satisfied  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:02):**  that whatever new technology they were testing  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:05):**  was working very well for them,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:06):**  80 or 90% the second or third year.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:09):**  So it would scale very, very quickly.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:11):**  All those pieces that I discussed now are,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:14):**  up to this point, are relatively logical, straightforward,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:18):**  and you might be thinking,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:19):**  oh, they're not such a big deal.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:21):**  But intriguingly enough,  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:22):**  there are a couple of those characteristics  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:25):**  that I talked about  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:26):**  that many farmers consistently fail to apply.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:29):**  But this next group, two more characteristics,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:33):**  are not commonly talked about.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:36):**  They are not necessarily logical.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:41):**  They catch many people by surprise initially.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:44):**  And then when they start to think about them,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:46):**  I often get the response,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:48):**  oh yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:51):**  The first characteristic in this group  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:53):**  is that the most successful growers,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:56):**  the most successful farmers,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:58):**  develop a deep, intuitive connection  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:02):**  to the crops that they're growing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:05):**  This is a characteristic  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:06):**  that particularly in agriculture and farming,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:08):**  we're very comfortable talking about this  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:10):**  in the context of animal agriculture,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:13):**  but many people have been sometimes less comfortable  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:17):**  talking about it in the context  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:19):**  of working with plants.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:21):**  So you're working with a dairy farmer.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:24):**  In my community, when I was growing up,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:26):**  and even today,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:28):**  there'll be a lot of small-scale dairies  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:30):**  that would have their upper-end cows,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:33):**  that the cows that they were taking really good care of  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:35):**  would still be in tie stalls.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:36):**  Maybe smaller-scale dairies,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:38):**  it would be completely normal  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:40):**  for a farmer to walk into a tie-stall barn  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:43):**  with two rows of cows.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:45):**  All the cows are standing there,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:47):**  patiently waiting to be fed.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:49):**  They all look essentially identical.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:52):**  And he would point at one cow and say,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:54):**  hmm, there's something wrong with that cow.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:59):**  And there is absolutely no visual indication  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:05):**  that we can quantify  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:07):**  that something is wrong with that cow.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:11):**  But the farmer will work with her and treat her  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:13):**  and hopefully get her to recover  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:17):**  before she becomes worse.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:18):**  In the dairy farming world, this is very common.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:21):**  It's considered to be a characteristic  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:24):**  of good dairy employees and good dairy managers,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:27):**  and they pay very close attention  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:28):**  to the animals that are in their care.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:30):**  I'm using cows as an example,  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:31):**  but the same holds true for sheep or chickens  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:34):**  or hogs or anything else,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:35):**  perhaps not chickens and hogs and large-scale operations.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:38):**  And of course, everything that I'm describing for animals  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:40):**  is true if you have an operation small enough  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:43):**  to facilitate a bit of connection.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:46):**  But we find that the most successful growers  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:49):**  have this same type of connection  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:51):**  to the crops that they're working with.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:53):**  For example, we might be walking with a grower  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:57):**  through an orchard, and we get to one block,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:01):**  and the grower will say something like,  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:04):**  I have no idea what's going on with this block,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:07):**  but it just doesn't feel right.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:09):**  This block doesn't feel good.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:11):**  Something is wrong. Something is off.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:14):**  And he can't really quantify why he feels that way.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:19):**  There is not a specific indicator  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:22):**  that he can point to to say, ah, this is a problem.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:26):**  He may look for indicators to try to justify  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:30):**  why he is feeling a certain way.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:32):**  Anyway, without delivering the point any further,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:35):**  I would just want to say that it's become very clear  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:39):**  that the most successful growers  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:41):**  actively try to have that connection to their crops  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:47):**  and to try to pay very close attention  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:49):**  to what's happening and what's going on in the field  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:51):**  to the point where they can feel when something is off,  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:56):**  even when they may not be able to articulate it with words.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:59):**  That intuitive connection then leads  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:03):**  to the second major characteristic,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:06):**  which really defines these exceptional managers.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:09):**  They acknowledge and begin resolving  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:14):**  the internal dissonance between their ideals  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:19):**  and their core values and some of the decisions  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:23):**  that they feel forced to make on a day-to-day basis.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:27):**  What do I mean by that?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:28):**  Well, when I speak with growers and I ask them the question,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:33):**  why do you farm?  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:34):**  What is it that attracted you to farming?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:36):**  You could have chosen many other professions  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:38):**  that you could have chosen to leave at any point,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:41):**  but you've chosen to remain in a profession  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:43):**  that is really challenging.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:44):**  It's a lot of hard work.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:45):**  There's long hours.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:47):**  Pay is uncertain.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:49):**  Why did you choose to continue farming?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:52):**  And when I begin unwrapping the answers  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:57):**  and digging a little bit deeper,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:59):**  the common theme that emerges is many growers  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:03):**  have a strong desire to be connected  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:05):**  to life and living processes.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:07):**  They love watching seeds germinate in the spring,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:11):**  watching the joy of a newborn animal bouncing around,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:14):**  listening to the songbirds as they migrate back  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:17):**  in the spring, watching flowers bloom.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:20):**  These connections to living processes and living systems  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:25):**  are really at the foundation of why many farmers  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:31):**  chose to remain in farming.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:34):**  The challenge is that since the Green Revolution,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:39):**  particularly in the last 50 years,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:41):**  we have adopted a model of agriculture  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:43):**  that is directly antagonistic to these core values,  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:47):**  where we have a model of agriculture  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:50):**  that is very much based on a warfare mentality  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:53):**  of search and destroy, identify a specific pest,  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:57):**  identify a specific pathogen,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:59):**  and figure out how you can kill it.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:01):**  And if you're not successful  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:02):**  with the first weapon of choice,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:05):**  you simply get a bigger bomb, get a stronger pesticide,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:07):**  get a stronger fungicide.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:09):**  On one hand, we have this deep core value  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:14):**  and this desire to produce healthy, high-quality food  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:18):**  and to do a really good job, to leave a legacy  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:21):**  for our children and our grandchildren for the future.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:24):**  You have these ideals and these core values  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:26):**  to produce a much higher-quality product  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:30):**  that doesn't have any negative impacts on people,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:32):**  doesn't have any negative impacts on the land.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:35):**  But on the other hand, we are often in a position  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:40):**  where we feel the need to apply pesticides  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:44):**  and to apply products that we know  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:46):**  are damaging to our soil health,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:49):**  we know have the potential to be damaging  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:51):**  to the people who are consuming that food.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:54):**  And this is what I refer to as the internal dissonance,  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:56):**  the dissonance between our ideals  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:59):**  and the choices that we feel forced to make.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:03):**  What I've observed with the most exceptional farm managers  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:08):**  who are doing a really great job  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:09):**  is they recognize the internal dissonance.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:13):**  They don't necessarily make an immediate switch or change,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:17):**  and I would be the last to recommend that.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:19):**  They don't all of a sudden one day wake up and say,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:22):**  okay, I'm never going to apply any pesticides ever again.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:26):**  Instead, they say, oh, hmm,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:31):**  that's why I've been feeling the way that I've been feeling,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:33):**  this subtle sense of discomfort.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:35):**  So I'm making it my goal, my personal goal,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:38):**  to get to a point where I can really live  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:43):**  the core values and the ideals that I have  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:45):**  where I no longer need to apply pesticides  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:47):**  because I really want to leave a legacy for the future.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:51):**  So I want to actively begin working towards that,  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:55):**  and I want to begin learning about how I can really achieve  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:58):**  the goals that I have around my personal ideals  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:01):**  and my personal core values.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:05):**  Every single time when a grower recognizes that  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:10):**  and begins thinking about it,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:11):**  how can I begin farming and growing crops  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:14):**  in a way that aligns with my core values  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:17):**  and begins working towards that,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:20):**  they become incredibly fulfilled.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:23):**  They begin having a lot of fun,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:25):**  and there is a lot of passion and spark  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:29):**  in those growers that is contagious,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:32):**  and they're really fun people to be around  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:35):**  because they're learning new things, they are excited,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:38):**  and there is an incredible level of enthusiasm.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:41):**  They are having a ton of fun.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:43):**  They love what they do.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:45):**  I have spoken to many different groups of farmers  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:50):**  and growers over the years.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:52):**  There are some groups.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:54):**  Sometimes you go to a conference or a trade show,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:58):**  and the energy is down.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:01):**  It's just flat.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:03):**  People are talking about disease challenges  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:06):**  and insect challenges and weather challenges,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:09):**  always weather challenges,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:11):**  and there's a sense of pessimism.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:15):**  And then sometimes you can go to other conferences  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:19):**  where there is an overwhelming sense of optimism  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:23):**  and enthusiasm, and people love what they do,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:26):**  and they're really fulfilled  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:27):**  in the work that they're doing.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:29):**  Generally, those conferences are the events  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:33):**  where farmers have begun moving towards farming  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:40):**  after their own ideals and after their own values.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:43):**  Many of the growers that we work with as a company  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:45):**  are not organic.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:46):**  There are also many that are, but most are not.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:49):**  But I will say that the energy and the spirit  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:55):**  at an organic farming conference  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:57):**  or a regenerative agriculture  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:59):**  or a no-till farming conference  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:00):**  as compared to a conventional  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:02):**  mainstream agriculture conference is completely different.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:05):**  And I would invite anyone,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:07):**  if you haven't participated  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:09):**  in one of those non-mainstream events,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:13):**  I would suggest that you participate sometime  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:15):**  just to get a sense for what I'm describing  
**[0:28:18-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:18):**  and talking about.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:18):**  That's a very worthwhile use of your time.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:21):**  One of the pieces that I could perhaps expand on  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:24):**  just because it's so important  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:26):**  is the very first piece that I talked about,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:29):**  how prioritizing the finances of a farm  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:35):**  changes a grower's behavior  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:38):**  around where they spend their personal time and energy.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:40):**  Let me give you an example  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:43):**  that I'm intimately familiar with,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:45):**  which is cherry production.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:47):**  Cherry growers are directly compensated  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:50):**  for size and firmness.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:53):**  So producing large, firm cherries  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:57):**  is a direct result of understanding  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:59):**  the overall tree physiology,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:01):**  but then in particular,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:03):**  understanding what is happening at the cell division  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:05):**  and cell expansion phase.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:07):**  So the most successful growers  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:10):**  focus on understanding that piece  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:13):**  of fruit tree physiology really, really well.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:17):**  They will ask questions about what is happening  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:20):**  at cell division and cell expansion  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:22):**  and try to understand that piece  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:24):**  and not delegate it to someone else.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:27):**  All right, I hope you've enjoyed the discussion tonight.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:31):**  Thanks everyone, bye.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:33):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:36):**  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:39):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:43):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:45):**  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:48):**  We also believe that healthy plants  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:50):**  are resistant to pests and disease,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:52):**  and that to grow healthy crops,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:54):**  we must first think different about agriculture,  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:56):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:59):**  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:30:02):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:30:04):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:30:06):**  with less risk of crop failure.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:30:08):**  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.

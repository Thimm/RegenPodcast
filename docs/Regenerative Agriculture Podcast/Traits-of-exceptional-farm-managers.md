### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-00-25)
**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which  all other growing systems are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere,  and when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:19):**  or email me, john at regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com.

**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:34):**  which is why you might notice audio quality is a bit lower.  Growers expressed a lot of appreciation  for the observations I shared,  which is why I also wanted to share it with you  here on the podcast.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:45):**  Well, good evening, friends.  Thank you for joining us.  I will be talking about a slightly different topic  from those that I normally speak of,  where I'm normally talking about agronomics.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:01:56):**  A number of growers have asked me to repeat a presentation  that I first talked about at the World Ag Expo  a couple of years ago,  where I was asked to talk about the characteristics  of exceptional farm managers,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:11):**  and it separates those farm managers  who have an exceptional degree of success.  The context and the history behind this  is in some of the work that we've done  at Advancing Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:22):**  When we first started with our initial consulting work  and then started product development work,  one of our practices was that every year  at the end of a growing season,  we would sit down with all of our consultants  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:36):**  around the table and we would rank the success,  not in terms of necessarily in terms of  the growers management success or financial success  or anything like that,  but more specifically in terms of their agronomic success.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:48):**  How successful were we in producing the yield levels  that we thought should be possible?  And what was working?  What was not working?  It's a very fascinating exercise.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:02:59):**  So we would rank the agronomic performance  of the crops that we were working with  on a scale of one to 10.  And then we would group the nines and tens together,  the ones and twos together,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:11):**  and we would ask what are the similarities  between the nines and tens?  What characteristics do these farm managers share in common  that are quite different from the rest,  most of the rest of the group?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:24):**  And similarly with the ones and twos,  what are the common characteristics amongst those farms  that are not enjoying the level of success?  So this was a fascinating exercise  and we've repeated the same exercise  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:36):**  year after year after year,  and we learned an awful lot.  We learned a lot about agronomy.  If I recall correctly, it was 2011 or 12,  where we realized that all of the growers  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:03:50):**  or most of the growers in the number one  and number two category who were not enjoying  the degree of agronomic success  that we thought should be possible  were making foliar applications with poor quality water.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:04):**  And so that was kind of our first revelation  of how extremely important water quality is  for foliar applications of nutrients.  However, over the last four years  that we have repeated this exercise,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:24):**  all of a sudden the differences that started showing up  were no longer differences about agronomics.  They were no longer differences of, for example,  using hard water or poor quality water  for foliar applications.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:35):**  Instead, the differences that started showing up  were differences in the management characteristics  of how were growers managing their operation.  So we developed a group of core characteristics  that describe this group of very successful farm managers.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:04:57):**  Things happen to these growers as well,  environment and climate impacts  that are beyond their control,  but consistently side by side,  when compared with growers growing the exact same crops,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:07):**  the exact same neighborhood,  they consistently outperform those growers.  What are the characteristics that those growers share  and why does that happen?  Well, perhaps one of the biggest pieces  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:20):**  that really stood out was how they thought about money  and the finances on their farm  and how that influenced their behavior and their priorities,  because they prioritized their personal time and energy  and the things they learned about completely differently  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:39):**  based on their interactions with money  and how they thought about managing money  and managing the finances on the farm.  Obviously, as we know, agriculture and farming  is a challenging profession.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:05:54):**  For most of the crops that we're growing,  we're talking about very large volumes, very tight margins.  There's not a lot of room to wiggle margin-wise  and we need to manage costs very carefully,  but we observed that there was a strong polarity  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:12):**  in the way that they thought  about managing their farm's balance sheet.  If you want to balance a budget on any enterprise,  then you have two major categories that you can play with.  You can focus on increasing revenues  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:26):**  or you can focus on reducing costs.  And obviously, in the agriculture environment,  you can't ignore either of those.  You have to pay close attention to costs.  You have to pay very close attention to revenues.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:40):**  But we discovered the most successful farm managers  thought about these two categories completely differently  from most of the growers that we were working with.  Most growers became personally engaged  and spent a lot of their personal time  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:06:56):**  and personal energy managing costs.  They focused very heavily on the cost side of the budget  and reducing costs, reducing inputs.  They made that their personal responsibility.  From a financial perspective,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:11):**  that is where they spent perhaps 80% of their personal focus  on the financial spectrum.  Increasing revenues is an area  that the less successful farm managers  spent a little bit of time on,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:24):**  but in this area, they would delegate a lot.  So they would delegate to crop consultants  and to veterinarians, to agronomists,  to make recommendations for what nutrients to be applied  or what cover crops to be planted  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:41):**  or whatever the case might be  to look at various tools and practices  that they might be able to use to increase revenue.  So they would invest personally,  perhaps 20% of their own time and energy  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:07:53):**  focusing on increasing revenue  and 80% of their personal energy on reducing costs.  This was in stark contrast to the most successful growers.  The most successful growers  would do the exact opposite, managing costs.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:10):**  They would delegate that to their accountants,  to their farm managers.  They didn't ignore it.  They still stayed on top of it.  They still paid close attention.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:19):**  They made sure that they were on track,  but they delegated most of the responsibility  and the priorities.  But on the side of increasing revenue,  they made sure that they understood  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:32):**  how to increase revenue on the farm personally, very deeply.  They absolutely categorically refused  to delegate that responsibility to anyone else.  In fact, this was so pronounced,  I think this is a characteristic  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:08:46):**  that's worth talking about for a little bit.  For every crop, even if you're growing a commodity crop  like corn or soybeans,  there are always a number of key pieces  that directly affect revenue.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:01):**  If you are growing blueberries, for example,  then the value of your blueberry crop,  particularly if you are shipping it  for an extended distance,  is based on size and firmness.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:16):**  In some parts of the country,  and you get premiums for firmness.  If you're growing wheat, for example,  you get premiums in many parts of the country  for producing higher protein content wheat.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:27):**  With commodity crops such as corn,  you get premiums for producing high test weight corn,  or in some cases on soybeans, high oil content.  My point is simply that for most crops,  there are key quality characteristics  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:09:42):**  that bring a premium either directly or indirectly.  The question these very successful growers ask themselves  is how do I make money with this crop?  They understand these quality characteristics,  whether it's increased firmness, increased protein content,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:00):**  increased test weight, whatever the characteristic might be.  And they make certain that they personally know  and understand that specific characteristic very deeply.  They do not delegate that to anyone else.  They don't delegate that knowledge to a consultant  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:19):**  or an agronomist or an advisor.  They certainly have consultants and agronomists  and advisors and people on their team that they work with,  but they want to make sure that they understand  that specific piece personally.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:32):**  So in terms of the economics and the finances of their farm,  the most successful growers spend roughly 20%  of their personal energy thinking about reducing costs  and 80% of their time and energy  thinking about how to increase revenue.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:10:48):**  They delegate most of the cost side,  and they personally take responsibility  for the revenue side.  This is an exact opposite to the less successful growers.  So this was one that really stood out very, very strongly.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:01):**  The second piece that really stood out  was the difference in implementation and execution.  The most successful farm managers  demanded perfect implementation and execution  from themselves and also from their employees.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:21):**  And obviously talking about an industry  where things always go wrong,  but when it came to developing infrastructure on a farm,  trellising trees, putting up a hoop house,  putting on a foliar application, setting pipe for irrigation,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:34):**  whatever activity was needed or necessary,  they expected perfect execution.  The rows needed to be perfectly straight  or perfectly on contour.  They demanded the best of execution,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:11:46):**  both of themselves and of their employees.  Another difference was their planning  for the future of their operation  and the things that they wanted to be working on.  So the most successful managers we saw consistently  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:01):**  would be thinking into the future  and about projects that they wanted to work on in the future.  So what a new type of trellising and managing trees  might look like in the future,  or new varieties for a crop that they're growing,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:18):**  like strawberries or tomatoes,  and new types of growing systems.  So they're constantly looking for new technology, new ideas,  and they're thinking about where the industry that they're in  is going to be in three to five years from now or longer.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:34):**  So they're thinking into the future more longer term.  And generally we find that the less successful growers  are thinking at the most about 12 to 18 months in advance  of what their crops they want to be growing  and what the future of those crops might be.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:12:51):**  There was another very interesting characteristic  that tied back to our first point of delegation  versus personal engagement in our increasing revenue  versus reducing costs.  Once a grower identified the critical pieces,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:08):**  the critical points that had an impact on increasing revenue,  they wanted to understand precisely what was happening  inside the plant from a physiological perspective.  Are we talking about kernels  at a specific stage of kernel development?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:22):**  What influences that stage of kernel development?  How can I change it?  How can I increase test weight, protein content?  They would pay very close attention to those pieces.  And then the extension from that is they would focus  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:37):**  on developing manageable data.  When I say manageable data,  what I mean is they would identify a specific point.  So let's just say for the sake of discussion  that increasing protein content in wheat.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:13:54):**  After reading the literature  and speaking to a group of advisors and consultants,  a farmer might identify that increasing protein content  on wheat is related to the mineral balance  of six key minerals  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:10):**  at a specific stage of plant development.  I'm making up a hypothetical example.  That grower would then make absolutely certain  rather than just saying,  okay, I need to make sure that plants  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:21):**  have enough of these six minerals.  I'm going to go out there and foliar feed all my acres  with these six nutrients just before this time period.  They wouldn't take a blanket shotgun approach,  but instead they would say, okay,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:35):**  how can I know exactly what the nutritional requirements are  of this plant at this stage of development?  So I think a challenge that we have in parts of agriculture  is we develop a lot of data,  but it doesn't necessarily transfer readily  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:14:52):**  into making management decisions.  We can have all the data in the world,  but what do we do with it?  How can we transfer it  into actually making a difference on a farm?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:02):**  The most successful growers have no desire  to have a lot of data  just for the sake of having a lot of data.  They want to have data about those specific points  that they know they can and need to influence  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:14):**  in order to increase revenue.  So that is a major piece that they focus on very intensely.  Another intriguing characteristic  of these exceptionally successful growers  was the amount of time they spent learning.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:29):**  Just in observations and watching them,  I would suggest somewhere in the neighborhood  of about five to 10% of their time was spent learning,  going attending conferences, going to field days,  reading books, talking to people on the phone,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:45):**  all these various activities.  They were constantly, they were very inquisitive  about learning new information  that would help them manage their crops better.  Sometimes in agriculture,  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:15:58):**  it's a legacy business.  And in that, many growers and many farmers  see it as much more than just the opportunity to make money.  It's also their home, it's their family,  and they have a strong desire to leave a legacy behind.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:19):**  And that is an incredibly valuable mindset  and mind frame from many different perspectives.  However, it sometimes can lead to not wanting things  to change from the way they have been.  Somebody sent me a quote recently  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:37):**  that kind of cracked me up a little bit.  There are some people who are open to progress,  but resistant to change.  So they're open to having progress happen,  but they don't personally want to change.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:16:51):**  They want it to happen to other people.  This characteristic absolutely does not define  the most successful growers.  These are growers that are extremely adaptable.  In many cases, they are early adopters.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:05):**  They're constantly looking for new ideas  and new technologies that they can adopt  and implement on their operation.  There is one mantra that we heard repeated  over and over again from these early adopters.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:19):**  They may have a bit more of an appetite to try new things.  They're more comfortable with the risk of trying new things,  conducting a pilot, running some trials,  testing things on their own operation.  This was a mantra that was quite common.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:33):**  Think big, start small, and scale fast.  So when experimenting with new technologies and new ideas,  they might conduct a trial on a small part  of their total operation,  but the moment it demonstrated performance and effectiveness,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:17:51):**  they would scale that very, very quickly  across their entire operation,  where they might increase,  they might go from 3% of their acres one year  to once they were satisfied  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:02):**  that whatever new technology they were testing  was working very well for them,  80 or 90% the second or third year.  So it would scale very, very quickly.  All those pieces that I discussed now are,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:14):**  up to this point, are relatively logical, straightforward,  and you might be thinking,  oh, they're not such a big deal.  But intriguingly enough,  there are a couple of those characteristics  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:25):**  that I talked about  that many farmers consistently fail to apply.  But this next group, two more characteristics,  are not commonly talked about.  They are not necessarily logical.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:41):**  They catch many people by surprise initially.  And then when they start to think about them,  I often get the response,  oh yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  The first characteristic in this group  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:18:53):**  is that the most successful growers,  the most successful farmers,  develop a deep, intuitive connection  to the crops that they're growing.  This is a characteristic  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:06):**  that particularly in agriculture and farming,  we're very comfortable talking about this  in the context of animal agriculture,  but many people have been sometimes less comfortable  talking about it in the context  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:19):**  of working with plants.  So you're working with a dairy farmer.  In my community, when I was growing up,  and even today,  there'll be a lot of small-scale dairies  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:30):**  that would have their upper-end cows,  that the cows that they were taking really good care of  would still be in tie stalls.  Maybe smaller-scale dairies,  it would be completely normal  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:40):**  for a farmer to walk into a tie-stall barn  with two rows of cows.  All the cows are standing there,  patiently waiting to be fed.  They all look essentially identical.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:19:52):**  And he would point at one cow and say,  hmm, there's something wrong with that cow.  And there is absolutely no visual indication  that we can quantify  that something is wrong with that cow.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:11):**  But the farmer will work with her and treat her  and hopefully get her to recover  before she becomes worse.  In the dairy farming world, this is very common.  It's considered to be a characteristic  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:24):**  of good dairy employees and good dairy managers,  and they pay very close attention  to the animals that are in their care.  I'm using cows as an example,  but the same holds true for sheep or chickens  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:34):**  or hogs or anything else,  perhaps not chickens and hogs and large-scale operations.  And of course, everything that I'm describing for animals  is true if you have an operation small enough  to facilitate a bit of connection.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:20:46):**  But we find that the most successful growers  have this same type of connection  to the crops that they're working with.  For example, we might be walking with a grower  through an orchard, and we get to one block,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:01):**  and the grower will say something like,  I have no idea what's going on with this block,  but it just doesn't feel right.  This block doesn't feel good.  Something is wrong. Something is off.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:14):**  And he can't really quantify why he feels that way.  There is not a specific indicator  that he can point to to say, ah, this is a problem.  He may look for indicators to try to justify  why he is feeling a certain way.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:32):**  Anyway, without delivering the point any further,  I would just want to say that it's become very clear  that the most successful growers  actively try to have that connection to their crops  and to try to pay very close attention  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:21:49):**  to what's happening and what's going on in the field  to the point where they can feel when something is off,  even when they may not be able to articulate it with words.  That intuitive connection then leads  to the second major characteristic,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:06):**  which really defines these exceptional managers.  They acknowledge and begin resolving  the internal dissonance between their ideals  and their core values and some of the decisions  that they feel forced to make on a day-to-day basis.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:27):**  What do I mean by that?  Well, when I speak with growers and I ask them the question,  why do you farm?  What is it that attracted you to farming?  You could have chosen many other professions  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:38):**  that you could have chosen to leave at any point,  but you've chosen to remain in a profession  that is really challenging.  It's a lot of hard work.  There's long hours.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:22:47):**  Pay is uncertain.  Why did you choose to continue farming?  And when I begin unwrapping the answers  and digging a little bit deeper,  the common theme that emerges is many growers  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:03):**  have a strong desire to be connected  to life and living processes.  They love watching seeds germinate in the spring,  watching the joy of a newborn animal bouncing around,  listening to the songbirds as they migrate back  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:17):**  in the spring, watching flowers bloom.  These connections to living processes and living systems  are really at the foundation of why many farmers  chose to remain in farming.  The challenge is that since the Green Revolution,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:39):**  particularly in the last 50 years,  we have adopted a model of agriculture  that is directly antagonistic to these core values,  where we have a model of agriculture  that is very much based on a warfare mentality  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:23:53):**  of search and destroy, identify a specific pest,  identify a specific pathogen,  and figure out how you can kill it.  And if you're not successful  with the first weapon of choice,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:05):**  you simply get a bigger bomb, get a stronger pesticide,  get a stronger fungicide.  On one hand, we have this deep core value  and this desire to produce healthy, high-quality food  and to do a really good job, to leave a legacy  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:21):**  for our children and our grandchildren for the future.  You have these ideals and these core values  to produce a much higher-quality product  that doesn't have any negative impacts on people,  doesn't have any negative impacts on the land.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:35):**  But on the other hand, we are often in a position  where we feel the need to apply pesticides  and to apply products that we know  are damaging to our soil health,  we know have the potential to be damaging  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:24:51):**  to the people who are consuming that food.  And this is what I refer to as the internal dissonance,  the dissonance between our ideals  and the choices that we feel forced to make.  What I've observed with the most exceptional farm managers  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:08):**  who are doing a really great job  is they recognize the internal dissonance.  They don't necessarily make an immediate switch or change,  and I would be the last to recommend that.  They don't all of a sudden one day wake up and say,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:22):**  okay, I'm never going to apply any pesticides ever again.  Instead, they say, oh, hmm,  that's why I've been feeling the way that I've been feeling,  this subtle sense of discomfort.  So I'm making it my goal, my personal goal,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:38):**  to get to a point where I can really live  the core values and the ideals that I have  where I no longer need to apply pesticides  because I really want to leave a legacy for the future.  So I want to actively begin working towards that,  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:25:55):**  and I want to begin learning about how I can really achieve  the goals that I have around my personal ideals  and my personal core values.  Every single time when a grower recognizes that  and begins thinking about it,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:11):**  how can I begin farming and growing crops  in a way that aligns with my core values  and begins working towards that,  they become incredibly fulfilled.  They begin having a lot of fun,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:25):**  and there is a lot of passion and spark  in those growers that is contagious,  and they're really fun people to be around  because they're learning new things, they are excited,  and there is an incredible level of enthusiasm.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:41):**  They are having a ton of fun.  They love what they do.  I have spoken to many different groups of farmers  and growers over the years.  There are some groups.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:26:54):**  Sometimes you go to a conference or a trade show,  and the energy is down.  It's just flat.  People are talking about disease challenges  and insect challenges and weather challenges,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:09):**  always weather challenges,  and there's a sense of pessimism.  And then sometimes you can go to other conferences  where there is an overwhelming sense of optimism  and enthusiasm, and people love what they do,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:26):**  and they're really fulfilled  in the work that they're doing.  Generally, those conferences are the events  where farmers have begun moving towards farming  after their own ideals and after their own values.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:43):**  Many of the growers that we work with as a company  are not organic.  There are also many that are, but most are not.  But I will say that the energy and the spirit  at an organic farming conference  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:27:57):**  or a regenerative agriculture  or a no-till farming conference  as compared to a conventional  mainstream agriculture conference is completely different.  And I would invite anyone,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:07):**  if you haven't participated  in one of those non-mainstream events,  I would suggest that you participate sometime  just to get a sense for what I'm describing  and talking about.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:18):**  That's a very worthwhile use of your time.  One of the pieces that I could perhaps expand on  just because it's so important  is the very first piece that I talked about,  how prioritizing the finances of a farm  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:35):**  changes a grower's behavior  around where they spend their personal time and energy.  Let me give you an example  that I'm intimately familiar with,  which is cherry production.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:28:47):**  Cherry growers are directly compensated  for size and firmness.  So producing large, firm cherries  is a direct result of understanding  the overall tree physiology,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:01):**  but then in particular,  understanding what is happening at the cell division  and cell expansion phase.  So the most successful growers  focus on understanding that piece  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:13):**  of fruit tree physiology really, really well.  They will ask questions about what is happening  at cell division and cell expansion  and try to understand that piece  and not delegate it to someone else.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:27):**  All right, I hope you've enjoyed the discussion tonight.  Thanks everyone, bye.  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:43):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  We also believe that healthy plants  are resistant to pests and disease,  and that to grow healthy crops,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:29:54):**  we must first think different about agriculture,  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  about regeneration versus degeneration.  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:30:06):**  with less risk of crop failure.  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.  Thanks for listening.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/traits-of-exceptional-farm-managers/#t=0:31:41):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

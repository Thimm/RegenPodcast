**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  
**[0:00:01-0:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:01):**  I'm passionate about developing  
**[0:00:04-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:04):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:06):**  that improve soil health,  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:07):**  produce crops that are completely resistant  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:09):**  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:14):**  that we can have a legitimate conversation  
**[0:00:16-0:00:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:16):**  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:20):**  with incredible knowledge and information  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:22):**  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:26):**  is scattered all over the place.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:27):**  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:33):**  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:35):**  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:42):**  that growers can easily put into practice.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:45):**  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:48):**  become the mainstream globally,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:51):**  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:54):**  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:56):**  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:00):**  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:03):**  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:07):**  they will increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:09):**  and resilience to climate stress.

**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:31):**  Hi friends, I'm here with a consultant  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:32):**  and one of the original co-founders of Midwestern BioAg,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:36):**  Gary Zimmer, who has been a leader  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:38):**  in the biological farming field for many years,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:41):**  several decades, and was one of my original mentors  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:45):**  in getting started.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:46):**  Gary, thank you very much for being here with us today.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:48):**  I'm very honored to have you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:49):**  That's my pleasure.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:50):**  Look forward to our discussion.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:52):**  Gary, you've done a lot of work over the years  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:55):**  in many different areas,  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:56):**  obviously with your background in dairy and nutrition  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:58):**  and the work that you've done with Midwestern BioAg.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:01):**  What are some of the really memorable moments  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:04):**  that led you to where you are today?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:06):**  I think it really started out,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:08):**  of course there was a lot of questioning  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:09):**  going back on in the 70s.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:11):**  We got to go way back that far.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:13):**  I was teaching at a technical college  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:15):**  and I got introduced to the fact  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:17):**  that what we put on the fields affected the feed  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:20):**  that we fed the cows.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:21):**  And that was like, oh my gosh,  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:23):**  that meant that we could change feeds.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:25):**  I think prior to that time,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:26):**  most dairy people would ever feed the farmer grew  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:30):**  and they would just take a sample  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:32):**  and add what was short or dilute it down  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:33):**  to try to make a ration.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:35):**  And then we realized we could change that feed.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:37):**  And then if you think about it,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:39):**  we ought to be able to change food.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:40):**  We ought to be able to change a lot of things we consume  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:42):**  by getting healthier soils, better mineral balance.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:45):**  And so that was one of the real moments  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:47):**  of changing my career.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:48):**  And then I teaching at the technical college,  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:50):**  I was a dairy nutrition guy,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:51):**  but I had to do soils and agronomy and farm finance.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:55):**  And so I brought in outside speakers  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:57):**  and my next kind of a moment was I was introduced  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:59):**  to Brookside Laboratory Farms out of New Knoxville, Ohio.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:02):**  Back in those days, they were a pretty big force  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:04):**  in Southeastern Minnesota where I was.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:06):**  And I learned an awful lot for some really good mentors.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:09):**  I always picked people.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:11):**  I didn't create or develop too much.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:13):**  I paid a lot of attention.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:14):**  And I think as time goes on,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:15):**  we all got better at understanding soils and soil health.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:18):**  I had some really good teachers in the beginning  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:20):**  through that Brookside experience.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:22):**  Gary, there's a lot of conversation around  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:25):**  how we need healthy soils to produce healthy plants  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:29):**  and produce healthy food for people.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:31):**  And I sometimes hear people just saying  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:33):**  that that link is weak to describe.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:36):**  And so question that I have for you  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:37):**  as a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:39):**  how much can we impact food quality  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:42):**  by impacting soil health?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:44):**  And does it really make a difference for animals?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:46):**  And by extension, do you believe  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:47):**  it really makes a difference for people?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:49):**  Yes, I think it starts possibly  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:51):**  with finding limiting mineral factors.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:53):**  Like I always said, way back in the old days,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:56):**  we were under the assumption that N was N and P was P  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:58):**  and K was K and pHs were fine.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:01):**  Well, then we began to realize  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:02):**  that the sources of those minerals in this whole thing,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:04):**  if I had to define soil health  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:06):**  and soil fertility thrown into that discussion,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:09):**  it's the exchange of those nutrients.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:11):**  And calcium is really kind of king,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:13):**  not having the right pH,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:14):**  but having the right available levels of calcium.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:17):**  So soil health is really having a biological balance,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:20):**  a mineral balance and a beautiful structure,  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:23):**  loose, crumbly kind of chocolate cake,  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:25):**  kind of a structure to have this all happen in.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:27):**  So how do you achieve that?  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:28):**  And I think there's some really guideline principles.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:31):**  I know way back when I wrote my first book,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:33):**  we came up with the rules of biological farming  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:35):**  and now they have the rules of what soil health is.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:38):**  But I think there's a lot of common sense, common ground.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:40):**  I mean, you gotta have a variety of crops.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:42):**  You can't have a crust.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:43):**  You can't have packed ground.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:44):**  You can't over till it.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:46):**  And there's all kinds of factors  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:48):**  that affect what makes that thing work.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:50):**  And then of course, the thing that's hardest for people  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:52):**  to understand is this mineral thing.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:54):**  Just because you have minerals dumped on the soil  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:56):**  does not mean the plant gets them  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:58):**  in the right kind of a portion.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:59):**  And sometimes one interferes with another.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:01):**  And I think that's a hard one  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:03):**  that still needs a lot of work.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:04):**  But yes, having that all said,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:06):**  it does really impact our feed for our cattle  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:09):**  because the minerals coming through the feed that we created,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:12):**  we would get a 50% higher mineral uptake into our oranges.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:16):**  Those minerals are much more biologically available  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:19):**  to the animal than adding a stone.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:22):**  I say, as a human, if I said,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:24):**  I'm not getting enough nutrition and minerals,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:26):**  and I'm gonna take all these supplements.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:28):**  Well, are we designed to utilize those supplements  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:30):**  like we are designed to utilize the stuff  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:32):**  that should be in our food?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:35):**  One of the things that we've observed  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:36):**  over the last couple of years  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:37):**  as we've started using a lot of sap analysis,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:39):**  speaking to your comments on mineral balance  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:42):**  is that in many cases,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:43):**  the nutrient imbalances that crops experiencing,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:47):**  particularly nutrient deficiencies are a direct result  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:50):**  of the excesses of the products that growers apply.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:55):**  I just, no question about it.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:56):**  That's why these guys that dump on lots of nitrogen  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:59):**  or potassium, and then with that potassium  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:01):**  comes a lot of chloride in their salt form fertilizer.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:04):**  They are definitely interfering with calcium.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:07):**  And so the interference of the magnesium uptake,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:09):**  I think that's absolutely right.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:11):**  And that's the other thing you brought up,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:13):**  this sap analysis, just because you got a soil test  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:15):**  and some labs says everything is ideal.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:18):**  You and I both know that that doesn't necessarily translate  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:20):**  into the plant having an ideal.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:22):**  It's guys that are driving these high healthy,  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:24):**  high yielding crops.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:26):**  How are they paying attention to minerals?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:28):**  The levels that were determined by some lab  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:30):**  was based on what an average crop  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:32):**  and they're using a lot of plant protective compounds.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:34):**  So what would those numbers and ratios look like?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:36):**  And I'm sure you've seen a lot of things  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:38):**  in your testing and career that it isn't quite as simple  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:41):**  as just grabbing a salt test and putting something on.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:45):**  Our goal as farmers should not be to create  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:47):**  a pretty looking soil test.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:49):**  It needs to be to grow a really great crop.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:50):**  And yeah, I think that's been the fallacy sometimes  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:54):**  where soil analysis are used as the goal  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:56):**  rather than as a measuring stick or where we wanna go.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:02):**  And that was why in my career and in my books,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:05):**  I try to get it simplified so people can understand  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:07):**  and that's why separating out soil correction  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:10):**  from crop fertilizer, I think was a really good move  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:14):**  on farmers understanding it.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:16):**  They get a salt test back, I had a call this morning  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:18):**  from a producer and they said,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:19):**  well, our salt test looks pretty good.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:20):**  Does that mean we don't do anything?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:23):**  I said, well, that means that if that salt test was correct,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:26):**  that means you don't have anything major to correct.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:28):**  But we still, certain things like the boron, the sulfur,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:31):**  soluble calcium, there's certain things we still need  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:33):**  to feed the crop and that soil has a certain ability  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:36):**  to dish out minerals and how do we provide  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:38):**  all those extra other things that, like you said,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:40):**  ratios and excesses we put on interfered with.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:45):**  Gary, you mentioned the three foundational pieces,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:48):**  biology, minerals and structure, managing soil biology,  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:51):**  soil mineral balance and soil structure.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:54):**  Which of those three have you found the most challenging  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:57):**  to address and the most challenging to resolve?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:00):**  Probably gets back to the misunderstandings.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:03):**  Like I said, I think we do understand today the biology.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:07):**  We called my company Midwestern BioEgg  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:09):**  because of the fact I wanted them to focus on biology.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:12):**  But just because you focus on it,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:13):**  now what do we do about it?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:14):**  I think the minerals are probably the easiest.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:16):**  But then we still gotta decide  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:18):**  how much to put on and what source.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:20):**  Biology and tillage kind of the physical  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:23):**  all kind of work together.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:24):**  If you feed the soil a decent amount of different kinds  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:28):**  of carbons, then you gotta say, what kind of carbons?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:30):**  How do I manage them?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:31):**  Do I just leave them lay on top?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:33):**  Do I challenge them?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:34):**  You got all these questions and progress sometimes is slow.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:37):**  But so I think there's a real struggle  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:40):**  is trying to find the farmers to find  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:41):**  what their limiting factor is.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:43):**  And of course they're limited on budgets  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:44):**  and then to give it time.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:46):**  But I would probably say that of all the things  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:48):**  that's the hardest would be getting biology to work.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:50):**  Cause in order to get biology to work,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:52):**  that does provide my structure if I have that really working.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:55):**  That's probably the hard part to understand.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:58):**  Yeah, and that's been our experience as well  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:00):**  is that the biology has been the most difficult to get going.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:04):**  And in my observation,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:06):**  it's actually become more difficult over the years.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:08):**  It's harder now to regenerate biology  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:11):**  than it was 10 years ago when I started.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:13):**  And I wonder what the implications are  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:15):**  of continuing herbicide and pesticide applications  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:19):**  and whether they might be contributing to that challenge.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:22):**  We took on another farm, my family farms and were organic.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:26):**  And we took on this land and there wasn't a weed growing out  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:28):**  it had been chemicaled, heavy, heavy, heavy  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:31):**  for lots and lots of years.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:33):**  In the first year, there's not a weed out there.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:35):**  And then we grew some crops and we put our fertility on.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:37):**  And of course it seems to be struggling a little bit.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:40):**  And then we took it through a transition to organic  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:42):**  and grew some cover crops,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:43):**  but there was no weeds went to seed.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:44):**  So this fall we had a crop, a small grain in there  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:47):**  and then we put a nice cover crop in following it.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:49):**  The weeds are everywhere.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:51):**  So what it looks to me like the soil came alive  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:54):**  and those little seeds have been laying out there  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:56):**  suppressed by chemistry are now back trying to work.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:59):**  And it was this really an interesting kind of thing  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:01):**  as word that those weed seeds didn't get dropped on there.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:04):**  I just think that we had that thing  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:06):**  so suppressed with chemistry  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:08):**  that the biology wasn't functioning.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:09):**  So whether weeds or plants I'm trying to grow,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:11):**  it came back alive is what I see out here.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:14):**  And so you're right.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:15):**  And that's why as a dairy nutritionist  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:17):**  and when I started this business, we only worked in  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:19):**  cause we had a lot of small family dairy farmers  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:21):**  which a lot of them are gone now, which is sad to see.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:24):**  But a dairy farm because of manure use  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:26):**  and because of rotation, because having forages in line  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:29):**  and because they weren't such heavy chemical users  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:31):**  they were already half biological when we started.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah, it is amazing what forages  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:36):**  and what having a bit more crop diversity  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:37):**  can do in the system.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:38):**  You know that in the state of Iowa,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:40):**  anything that is not corn and soybeans  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:42):**  is considered a specialty crop.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:44):**  Alfalfa is considered a specialty crop.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:46):**  Wow, I just drove all the way out to Nebraska last week.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:49):**  That's right, there's nothing but corn and beans there.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:51):**  So there probably are specialty crops.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:55):**  In the wealth and the depth of experience that you have had,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:58):**  what has been something that really surprised you?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:01):**  Things I guess are really surprising me to now.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:04):**  I've seemed like I've been at this for 35 years  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:06):**  struggling away and maybe got into more specialty thing.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:09):**  Couple of things,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:10):**  because everybody's brother wants to get in organic now  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:12):**  because they want the money  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:13):**  but they don't understand the system.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:14):**  But I think the movement about soil health  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:17):**  and seeing NRCS get involved  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:19):**  and really push hard on this soil health,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:21):**  yet I wouldn't necessarily agree 100% with them,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:23):**  is at least it's bringing up the discussion  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:27):**  about the value of soil health and water infiltration  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:30):**  and all these things.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:31):**  And that's a kind of a real surprise to me  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:35):**  to see that that would happen on a conventional thing  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:37):**  that they wouldn't be talking about soil health.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:39):**  And they would be asking some of the questions  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:41):**  that we've been asking for many, many years.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:43):**  And now I see it in my world.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:45):**  I see so many conventional farms.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:47):**  They used to kind of not laugh at us,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:51):**  but they just thought,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:51):**  well, where's the research behind it?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:53):**  Now they're asking all kinds of really good questions  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:56):**  and paying attention.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:57):**  That's been a real big surprise to me.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:59):**  I didn't expect to see that in my lifetime.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah, we're seeing a tremendous shift as well  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:05):**  and tremendous desire for information.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:08):**  Continuing with that thought,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:09):**  you're surprised that people are inquiring  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:12):**  and because of the different perspective  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:14):**  that you've had in the past,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:15):**  could you elaborate a little bit on that?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:16):**  What is something that you believe to be true  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:18):**  about modern agriculture  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:20):**  that is very different from the mainstream view?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:23):**  So modern agriculture to me is this,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:25):**  I think what really changed some factors,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:27):**  not necessarily economically is that,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:29):**  see way back when I was at Brookside,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:32):**  I can sell in 1976.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:34):**  I stood on a farm in Northern Illinois  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:35):**  growing 375 bushel corn  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:37):**  with a public variety of corn  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:39):**  from University of Illinois on 40 inch rows.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:42):**  And you could stick your hand in the ground,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:43):**  clear your elbow.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:44):**  And this guy was his pet little project.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:47):**  I stood there and saw it.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:48):**  And of course I got my attention.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:49):**  Then in the nineties, of course,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:50):**  in Iowa, there's somebody grew there  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:52):**  300 or some bushel corn.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:54):**  These guys that are growing the 400 to 500 bushel corn  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:57):**  have really opened up the doors,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:58):**  I think to say that there's much more potential.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:01):**  See, I started my business back in the early eighties  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:03):**  by leasing a fertilizer facility in Northern Illinois.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:06):**  But we did very little business in Illinois.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:08):**  The soils are so good.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:10):**  That's all you gotta do is knife in anhydrous.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:12):**  And if you got seeds in the hopper,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:14):**  you're gonna get 150 bushel corn.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:16):**  Well, now they're saying $12,000 an acre land  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:19):**  and all these things out here.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:20):**  And so they're all chasing 300 bushel corn now.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:22):**  So we actually built a new fertilizer facility in Illinois  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:25):**  and hadn't done much business.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:26):**  They're part of that.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:27):**  But there's a whole new group.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:29):**  I like my strip till kind of farms for conventional.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:31):**  At least I can get that zone done right.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:33):**  A lot of that land is rented.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:34):**  Nobody wants to fix it, but that whole kind of a thing.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:38):**  So now is that transition to become conventional?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:42):**  That was why I find it kind of offensive when people say,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:45):**  how are we gonna feed all these people?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:47):**  And I say, 40% of our corn goes into making ethanol.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:50):**  And we have the capability of doubling our yields  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:52):**  and we can do it on a cleaner method of farming.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:55):**  It's not that we can't produce more food  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:57):**  and of course people don't even eat necessarily  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:58):**  corn and beans.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:59):**  We can do a lot of things if we wanna feed these people.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:01):**  But I think that conventional agriculture,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:04):**  if we want to whatever we wanna call it  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:06):**  or modern agriculture, what is mainstream?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:09):**  And I think mainstream is shifting  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:10):**  to a biological farming system.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:13):**  And that is exciting.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:15):**  It certainly is.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:16):**  And there's a lot of questions out here.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:18):**  And I guess I was just at a Nebraska  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:21):**  and it was a little shocking to me.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:23):**  They did an organic field.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:25):**  They all these guys wanna get an organic for the money.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:27):**  And what the whole group was actually thinking about  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:29):**  was just shuffling resources.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:30):**  Instead of buying an insecticide,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:32):**  let's buy an organic insecticide.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:34):**  Let's buy one that's certified.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:35):**  They kind of missed the whole point about soil health,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:37):**  but they'll get there eventually  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:39):**  if they're gonna make this work.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:40):**  Input substitution, very organic.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:42):**  If you're gonna buy organic nitrogen,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:43):**  you're gonna find out that whatever you get paid  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:45):**  for the product you grow isn't gonna be enough.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:47):**  You better figure out how to make the system work.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:50):**  Gary, one of the questions that I get asked sometime,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:53):**  there have been other stories about  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:55):**  extraordinary historical yields.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:57):**  Don Huber describes how a team that he was working with  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:00):**  was producing 450 plus bushel per acre corn  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:03):**  back in the late 70s.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:04):**  And you've just described 375 bushel corn 40 years ago.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:08):**  What happened with that technology and with those ideas?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:11):**  Why did we lose all that knowledge and information  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:13):**  over the last 40 years?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:15):**  I think what happened is like in that case,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:17):**  articles in the paper came out  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:19):**  and they said he put on 400 pounds of nitrogen  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:21):**  and 200 pounds of phosphorous and all these kinds of things.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:24):**  And they didn't really understand the fact  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:26):**  that that guy had an impact on soil health.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:28):**  Like I said, you can stick your arm in the ground  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:29):**  clear to your elbow.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:30):**  And the other thing they didn't understand  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:31):**  that a lot of that input came from manure and stuff.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:34):**  It wasn't from commercial fertilizer.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:35):**  So they were still under the mindset  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:38):**  that just putting on the commercial fertilizer did it.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:40):**  So the guys that went at it  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:42):**  and dumped on enough commercial fertilizer  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:44):**  to match his numbers didn't get the yields  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:46):**  because they missed the other factor  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:47):**  that in that livestock manure,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:49):**  there was a biological link  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:50):**  and there was also other trace minerals and things.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:52):**  It wasn't just N, B and K.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:54):**  So I think they didn't, it was at that time,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:56):**  it was a lack of understanding  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:57):**  what takes this system to work.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:58):**  And that's why it took a lot of years.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:00):**  And I think these master corn growing things  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:02):**  and people started experimenting with things.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:04):**  And so just like out here now,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:06):**  can we ever achieve the results that these guys talk about  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:10):**  without all the intervention of chemistry anywhere  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:12):**  and without a rotation and different varieties of plants  
**[0:16:16-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:16):**  to put out there?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:16):**  And I don't really think so.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:17):**  I think we need cover crops in between  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:19):**  or we need another crop.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:21):**  See, I think to change agriculture,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:23):**  it's really kind of simple.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:24):**  We need to subsidize something besides corn and beans.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:26):**  If they could just grow a small grain  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:28):**  and then put a cover crop in afterwards,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:30):**  now I got that nutrient in this carbon biological cycle.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:33):**  And so it's not just chemistry,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:35):**  it's how the nutrients are delivered to the plant  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:37):**  and then in the ratios.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:39):**  Gary, if you were president for a day  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:41):**  or for longer than that,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:42):**  and you had the capacity to influence change in agriculture,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:45):**  what are the things that you would change?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:47):**  Well, first thing I would do is I would tax nitrogen  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:50):**  so high that they couldn't afford to use very much of it.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:53):**  That's a step in the right direction.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:56):**  And the second thing I would do is I would subsidize  
**[0:16:59-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:59):**  a small grain.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:59):**  If we want to truly feed the people  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:01):**  that are starving in the world,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:02):**  they eat wheat better than they eat corn  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:04):**  or maybe got issues with wheat out here  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:05):**  because this gluten thing,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:06):**  but I think we've done things to wheat  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:07):**  that are probably caused that.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:09):**  So anyway, I subsidize some small grain  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:13):**  so that gives the farmer that rotation  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:15):**  and then tax nitrogen really high.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:18):**  And I would make changes on our environment and food.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:21):**  And I'd have guys scrambling to figure out  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:23):**  then the cover crops we brought forward.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:25):**  I don't want to subsidize cubs, crops.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:26):**  I want to subsidize something,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:27):**  something of food that grows the world  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:29):**  and let them figure it out.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:30):**  Because otherwise if you just give them money  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:31):**  to grow a cover crop,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:33):**  they never really figure out the system.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:35):**  And so if they have to figure out how to grow nitrogen,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:37):**  if they have to figure out how to get the plants healthier.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:39):**  And so my thing as a president of the day is really simple.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:42):**  I said, I don't think it's that hard to change agriculture.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:45):**  It's just what we put our focus on.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:47):**  There's a few key leverage points.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:51):**  Gary, you have a lot of experience with boots on the ground,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:53):**  working with many different farmers from all over the world.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:56):**  Often I find that there are a few key success factors  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:59):**  on a farm that growers may often overlook  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:02):**  or may not be paying attention to  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:03):**  that you have the benefit of insights on  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:05):**  having observed many different operations.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:08):**  What would you say are some of the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:10):**  often overlooked factors to success?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:13):**  I think one of the things is that,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:14):**  as I just started on this big project over in Eastern Europe,  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:17):**  if you start with a soil,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:19):**  if you've got soils over there  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:21):**  that are fairly high levels of calcium  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:23):**  or decent levels of calcium to begin with,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:25):**  that's a real benefit as compared to if you start  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:28):**  with a high magnesium, low calcium,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:30):**  or high potassium or high sodium kind of thing.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:32):**  And the other thing is that boots on the ground thing,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:35):**  and that's where my rotation, Eastern Europe,  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:37):**  those guys probably got six or seven different crops they grow  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:40):**  and that variety of different crops.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:41):**  Some of them taken off early, some late,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:43):**  they're growing rye in afterwards.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:45):**  And so in the world where you run into an area,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:47):**  I always tell our consultants,  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:49):**  you need to predict your success.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:50):**  Almost like saying a dairy farmer's a halfway  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:52):**  to being a biological farmer.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:54):**  I think the basis of all they start with,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:56):**  because they don't necessarily understand the nutrient input  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:59):**  and the variety of crops they grow,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:01):**  the variations of crops they grow.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:03):**  So that's why huge, big things  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:05):**  on soil health are crop variation.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:07):**  It took me a long time in my career  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:09):**  because I didn't have much of a mentor back in the old days.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:12):**  I read a lot of Albert papers.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:13):**  I read books all the time,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:15):**  Steiner's and everybody else's,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:16):**  but the mentoring part that comes along  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:18):**  with how do you learn some of these things?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:20):**  It took me a long time to figure out  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:22):**  that the plants determine the biology.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:24):**  Why else would you have to rotate?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:26):**  So diseases, the insects, the plants that digest corn,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:29):**  don't digest alfalfa.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:31):**  So this doggy dog biological balance in the soil,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:34):**  it's accidentally put in place on a lot of farms.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:37):**  Let's say they put on manure as input,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:38):**  or they got this crop rotation,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:40):**  is a huge step forward in their success.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:42):**  Because then they got diversity feed,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:44):**  diversity biology, and it eliminates a lot of their problems.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:48):**  I think this goes back to the discussion  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:50):**  that we were having earlier  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:52):**  about what is the most challenging thing to fix,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:54):**  being biology in the soil profile.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:56):**  And so there's this entire discussion in agriculture  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:58):**  that it takes a healthy soil to grow a healthy plant.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:01):**  And I think what we may have missed  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:03):**  is that the fastest way to develop a healthy soil  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:06):**  is to grow really healthy plants.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:08):**  Yes.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:09):**  And that's really interesting  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:10):**  because I'm involved with this project  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:11):**  out in South Dakota, this large organic transition thing.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:14):**  And I say, if I go to a farm  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:16):**  and they're not capable of growing a beautiful alfalfa,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:19):**  as an example, or a beautiful cover crop.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:22):**  So just saying I got a cover crop  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:23):**  and the plants are one per square yard,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:25):**  doesn't really, I want it thick and lush and beautiful.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:27):**  And then you gotta be willing to feed it to the soil  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:30):**  at the stage of growth that it affects the biology  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:33):**  in the soil for the outcome you want.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:35):**  So in other words, if I wanna grow a crop like corn  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:38):**  that recovers a lot of soluble nutrients,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:39):**  the crop I'm growing previous to the cover crop,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:41):**  when I'm feeding the soil biology,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:43):**  better be highly digestible and young and succulent.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:45):**  It's like, we always say, it's like feeding a cow  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:47):**  if I wanna get 100 pounds of milk.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:49):**  I wanna feed a legume,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:50):**  I could feed a more mature complex plant  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:53):**  that would feed maybe more of a fungal population  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:55):**  and wouldn't provide all the soluble nutrients.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:57):**  So then the plant itself would go to work  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:59):**  and the biology would work with it.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:00):**  And so there's all that kind of understanding  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:04):**  that I think has to take place within this system.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:06):**  Gary, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:11):**  I wish they knew and could stand back  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:14):**  and see this whole farming thing as a system.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:17):**  That's a, it's got all these little moving parts  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:20):**  and then their job becomes identifying limiting factors  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:23):**  or constraints within their system and fixing them.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:26):**  And so if they don't understand that,  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:29):**  they just understand it's chemistry and nutrients and crop.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:31):**  And I think most farmers in their mind,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:34):**  I mean, they just think, well, the bugs are in the air  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:36):**  and they're coming through, so I better spray.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:38):**  I was out in England and they developed something  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:40):**  at Cambridge University, as you put on the corner  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:42):**  of your farm that measures fungal spores.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:44):**  If the fungal spore gets to a certain height, you spray.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:46):**  And I said, really?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:48):**  That means if I was on an airplane,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:49):**  they put a monitor in the airplane,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:51):**  if the disease bugs are certain high enough,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:52):**  I would be taking the antibiotic.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:53):**  Is that the same analogy?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:55):**  I mean, it's like plants can defend and protect themselves  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:58):**  and farmers don't understand that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:59):**  They don't understand that trace windows  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:01):**  can do a lot to protect and make your plant healthier.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:03):**  And that nitrogen is a negative on fungal diseases  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:06):**  and causing trouble.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:07):**  They don't understand that they have an impact  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:09):**  on soil, on plant health.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:11):**  They don't really understand that.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:13):**  They still get their conventional mindset  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:14):**  that every time there's a problem, you spray it.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:16):**  Almost like an analogy would be,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:18):**  what in the world gave people the idea  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:20):**  that we could buy a jug full of bugs,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:23):**  dump it on the land and everything would be great?  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:26):**  Why won't those bugs survive?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:28):**  They aren't there now, why aren't they there now?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:30):**  They said they extract natural organisms from healthy soils  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:34):**  and put them on an unhealthy soil.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:36):**  Why would you think that would work?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:37):**  Why wouldn't we change what we did on the unhealthy soil?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:40):**  Exactly, and what makes you think  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:42):**  that they're going to survive  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:43):**  if you don't give them a food source?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:44):**  Yeah, and they might see a bushel or two gain  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:47):**  from doing this, they might see a little bit,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:48):**  but that's not fixing the system.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:52):**  Gary, for myself, the places that I've learned the most  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:55):**  are the places where something didn't work.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:57):**  When things don't work, you have to really dig in  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:59):**  and try to figure out and understand why they didn't work.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:02):**  What are some experiences that you've had  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:03):**  where things didn't work the way you expected?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:08):**  Yes, probably suspecting that if we just put on some calcium  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:13):**  or some balanced fertility that we would have  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:15):**  less of a disease or insect problem.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:16):**  I think just like we go onto our ground  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:18):**  and let's say the nematode population was excessive  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:21):**  and we didn't recognize or identify it  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:22):**  and we're trying to do these wonderful things,  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:24):**  but they're still out there.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:25):**  We haven't changed that whole part.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:27):**  And so I think we've seen the fact  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:28):**  that you've got to earn the right  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:30):**  not to use an insecticide or fungicide.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:32):**  So when we had failures that maybe we were jumping the gun  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:34):**  too far ahead and the farmer was anxious  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:37):**  to be able to get rid of some of those costs.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:38):**  And then of course we had failures  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:39):**  and it's hard to identify.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:40):**  Like people says, oh, there's a nutritional deficiency  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:42):**  out here.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:43):**  I said, yeah, but someone just ate the roots off.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:51):**  Gary, you've written a couple of books  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:53):**  and do you have another book coming out?  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:55):**  Are you working on a third one?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:58):**  The third book I'm working on is just really right now  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:01):**  is just totally different.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:02):**  It's the Frank Lloyd Wright Taliesin farm  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:04):**  that we farm here in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:06):**  Got a lot of visitors.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:07):**  We're writing a book about the history of agriculture,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:09):**  farming yesterday, today and tomorrow,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:11):**  which gives me a chance to go through the history  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:13):**  of agriculture in our community  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:15):**  and do it as an educational thing.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:16):**  So that farm was 40 years under a rented,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:19):**  heavy chemical input rundown.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:21):**  Nobody fixed anything.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:23):**  And it goes, now we've been farming for 20 years,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:24):**  but where's the future of that kind of land?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:27):**  That last book that when I just came out with a year ago,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:29):**  when I revised my first biological farm book,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:32):**  it's now a 500 page thing.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:33):**  I'm done with that book.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:34):**  I don't ever want to read it.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:35):**  I don't ever want to rewrite it again.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:37):**  That's enough.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:38):**  But I do want to do a dairy nutrition.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:41):**  I am a dairy nutritionist.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:42):**  There's a high forage dairy farm.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:44):**  We just took our dairy herd on our farm  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:45):**  and took all the grain away.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:47):**  See anything you add to the cow's diets,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:48):**  what's missing in the forages.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:50):**  Now, granted, we probably won't get as much milk,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:52):**  but we ought to be in a healthy production.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:53):**  So now I'm playing this game of what kind of forages  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:56):**  and at what kind of ratios is it going to take  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:58):**  to make a high producing or healthy producing  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:01):**  at the maximum level we can.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:02):**  And the more success we have,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:04):**  when you take all the tools away, like grains,  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:07):**  the more success we're going to have  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:08):**  by obviously getting more energy and more nutrition  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:11):**  into the food we grow.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:12):**  So it'll have a lot of angles on it.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:13):**  So that down the road someday,  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:15):**  when I get that all put together,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:17):**  that'll be my book that I want to do  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:18):**  is about high forage dairy farming.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:20):**  Let's talk about that a little bit more.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:22):**  Obviously the limitation that you have  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:24):**  in removing grains from dairy is energy.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:26):**  So how do you produce high enough energy forage  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:28):**  that you can safely remove grains?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:31):**  So now there are certain plant species that will help us,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:33):**  but again, it's this balance  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:35):**  of getting enough active calcium up.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:36):**  We've seen the sugar levels and refractomers and things.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:39):**  We saw the soluble carbohydrates,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:41):**  I shouldn't say sugar levels.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:42):**  We can get a big solid stem, non-alpha,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:44):**  and get more pectins into that plant.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:46):**  We can raise that energy level.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:47):**  Really, that's why cows and soot,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:49):**  that's why cows and soils are so much alike.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:51):**  And that's why as a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:53):**  those easy to do soils and cows,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:54):**  we call, we got to balance energy to protein.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:56):**  To get high digestible feeds in the dairy cow,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:59):**  we always struggle with excess protein.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:01):**  Then they're on the Atkins diet,  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:02):**  which burns up their energy.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:04):**  We have to get the right kinds of forages  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:06):**  that are going to make sure we got our energy  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:08):**  in line with our protein.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:09):**  And we got to have them highly digestible.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:12):**  But we can have an impact on any specific plant  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:14):**  on the amount of energy it takes in.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:16):**  Like now, the modern day farms,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:18):**  if you want to call these big mega farms,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:19):**  they feed an unbelievable amount of corn silage.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:22):**  And they're putting a lot of energy into the cows.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:24):**  And they can get a lot of milk out of the cows.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:26):**  Of course, the cows don't survive very long.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:27):**  And I question the quality of the milk  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:29):**  and the fatty acid makeup of it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:31):**  So we can have a profitable, healthy herd of cows  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:34):**  is our belief and opinion.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:35):**  And right now, a lot of the guys  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:37):**  that are all forages on the dairy herd  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:39):**  don't get enough milk volume to pay their bills.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:42):**  It's easy to feed grain.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:44):**  It's not so easy when it's gone and say,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:46):**  I got to get it all out of my feeds now.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:48):**  And I can't violate the principles of that cow.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:50):**  It needs energy to protein balance.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:52):**  It needs certain minerals.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:53):**  How do I avoid excessive minerals when it's all forages?  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:56):**  Like you said, excess impacts more damage probably  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:59):**  than the deficiencies do.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:00):**  And that's true for soils and cows.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:03):**  So that's why it's a real big challenge  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:04):**  to take that grain away.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:05):**  Well, a lot of the grazing dairy herds out here  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:08):**  that are all forages get about 8,000 pounds of milk.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:10):**  And we were at 20,000 pound herd average  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:13):**  when we went and took the grain away just six months ago.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:16):**  And yes, we've dropped in milk.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:17):**  Again, it's a whole system from genetics.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:19):**  We've been breeding for a smaller, bigger body capacity,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:23):**  taking food capacity out.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:24):**  And the heifers that we're having calved this fall  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:26):**  that were raised without grain are totally different  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:29):**  than the ones that you take the grain away from.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:31):**  Wow.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:32):**  So that's why I find it challenging and fun to learn.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:34):**  And I always hoped that we could get a 12 to 15,000 pound  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:37):**  herd average on all forages.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:38):**  That's our goal.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:39):**  And if we can do that and have cows healthy  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:41):**  and have a high quality milk,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:43):**  I think the consumers questioning food all the time.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:45):**  And that's why grass fed beef and grass fed  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:48):**  is really getting a lot of attention.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:50):**  But if that cow is unhealthy and sick eating grasses,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:52):**  that does not make a good quality product.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:55):**  Yeah, it does not.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:57):**  And the other interesting piece is we have this tremendous  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:59):**  dairy overproduction here in the country.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:01):**  If we had a substantial number of farmers,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:04):**  perhaps lowering production a little bit  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:06):**  and trying to produce a healthier, higher quality milk,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:07):**  that might also fix the milk consumption problem as well.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:10):**  Yes, I agree 100%.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:13):**  It's just like now in the corn world and bean world,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:15):**  they're all shopping to get more yields,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:16):**  maybe at an environmental cost  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:18):**  because they can't pay their bills,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:20):**  but then they spud the market more  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:21):**  and then they really won't be able to pay their bills.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:24):**  I think you're right.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:25):**  So I said, if everybody went like we did,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:26):**  we dropped three, 4,000, 5,000 pounds of milk on our cows.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:30):**  We've now taken some of the surplus off the market.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:32):**  If a lot of people did that,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:33):**  we wouldn't have a surplus if we figure this out.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:35):**  So it's comfortable.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:36):**  That's my role to make it more comfortable  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:38):**  for people to change to an all forage diet.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:40):**  That's what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:42):**  Gary, in addition to the books that you have written,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:44):**  what is a book or resource  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:46):**  that you would recommend most often to growers?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:48):**  I think about that quite a bit.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:50):**  And the ones that I mentored with  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:52):**  and what people really want to read is,  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:54):**  Acres USA is still a prime magazine for me.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:57):**  I probably get 15 magazines a month.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:59):**  I actually enjoy reading a strip till and no till magazines.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:03):**  There's an interesting amount of information  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:04):**  that people are starting to bring up and talk about.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:06):**  You gotta be able to put it in their perspective  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:08):**  and you gotta be able to read between the lines  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:10):**  on that kind of stuff.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:11):**  So for organic, I like my Moses conference.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:14):**  We have here in Wisconsin.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:15):**  There's a lot of resources and people there.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:18):**  And I think if you gotta get yourself educated,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:20):**  I think you gotta live your life under the fact  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:22):**  of being under the opinion instead of opinionated.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:25):**  I don't really care what your opinion is  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:27):**  and people shouldn't care what my opinion is,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:29):**  but they should recognize  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:30):**  what your life experience has brought forward  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:32):**  and say, how does that fit in my farming operation?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:34):**  How can I adopt some of those concepts and ideas?  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:37):**  I was a really big student of Don Schrieffer years ago.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:40):**  He taught me a lot about soil health and physics  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:42):**  and the strip till kind of a system all came from him.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:45):**  And that was a real big aspect of it.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:46):**  So I've read a lot of books and there's a lot  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:48):**  you can add to that that comes from that acres library  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:50):**  out here that I think would help people  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:52):**  get a better understanding.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:53):**  And education is still the thing that gives you the comfort  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:57):**  and the ability to recognize that, yes,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:59):**  this is a constraint on my farmer.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:01):**  No, that's probably not.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:03):**  Indeed.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:04):**  Gary, you have such a wealth of experience.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:06):**  We could take this conversation  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:07):**  in so many different directions.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:09):**  So what is the question that you wish I would have asked?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:12):**  What's the topic that you think is important to speak about?  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:14):**  I think we covered a lot of base.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:16):**  What would really be missing from our discussion out here?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:19):**  Is it necessary to get in more detail?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:21):**  I'm always interested in the things that you're doing  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:23):**  with these SAP analysis and the products you're doing  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:25):**  and when you're doing them and how for specialty  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:28):**  kind of crops or whatever they would be.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:29):**  I guess, did we get in enough detail?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:33):**  I'm always one of the guys that said  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:34):**  before you get to the detail,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:35):**  you better understand the big picture.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:37):**  And so I don't know, John,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:38):**  I think we've covered a lot of the basis  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:40):**  from my life experiences.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:42):**  I spent my life in career trying to transition  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:45):**  a lot of conventional thinkers  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:46):**  into a more biological mindset  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:48):**  without giving them so much detail.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:50):**  They get bogged down and lose sight of the fact  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:52):**  that they're not looking for some muck of magic out here  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:54):**  that they don't lose sight of the base.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:56):**  Did we cover that well enough?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:58):**  I think we asked those questions enough  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:00):**  so I don't really have any further answer  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:02):**  as to what we could have done better  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:04):**  or could have covered more.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:05):**  Well, I think there's always the need  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:08):**  to have more of those detailed conversations as well.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:10):**  And so I would love to invite you back into the podcast  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:15):**  at some point very soon to dive into  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:18):**  some of those more specific conversations.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:20):**  It's very important because there are many growers who,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:23):**  as you described earlier,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:24):**  we're open to the system, we want to learn the system.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:28):**  And of course, learning and understanding the system  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:30):**  is all about understanding the details  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:31):**  that comprise that system.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:33):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:34):**  So yeah, I would love to have you back  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:35):**  for more of those conversations  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:37):**  and I'm looking forward to that.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:38):**  In my lifetime, when we first started out  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:40):**  this fertilizer business,  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:41):**  it was about choosing better qualities.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:43):**  Instead of potassium chloride, we use potassium sulfate.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:45):**  Instead of DAP, rather, we use MAP and rock phosphate.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:48):**  And so we chose better sources  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:51):**  instead of using oxide traceracers, we use sulfates.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:53):**  Well, then as time went on,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:55):**  we started manufacturing fertilizers  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:57):**  and got involved with carbon-based fertilizers,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:59):**  trying to mimic what mother nature would do,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:02):**  if we want to call it that,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:03):**  by taking minerals up in plants  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:04):**  and having biology or food hooked to that.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:06):**  So that's another whole discussion as to  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:08):**  how can we deliver minerals and sources  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:10):**  and ways through this carbon thing.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:12):**  I think carbon linked with fertilizer  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:14):**  is not only more efficient.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:16):**  I just read a report the other day  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:17):**  that put a tracer on nitrogen  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:19):**  and found out that only about 25%  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:21):**  of the nitrogen these farmers actually apply  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:23):**  is sucked up into that plant.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:24):**  The rest of it is either lost or going through biology  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:27):**  or hooked into some carbon somewhere along the way.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:30):**  Doesn't surprise me at all.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:31):**  When we've started using SAP analysis on farms  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:34):**  to see what plants are actually truly absorbing  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:38):**  on many farms, I would say on most farms  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:40):**  that we begin working with,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:41):**  we can cut nitrogen application rates  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:43):**  from 30 to 50% or more with no decrease  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:47):**  in the nitrogen levels in the plant.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:49):**  Yeah, and we brought it up a little before I did see,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:52):**  people got to realize that just some of the projects  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:53):**  we're involved with,  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:54):**  if we truly want to sequester carbons,  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:56):**  we got to back off nitrogen  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:57):**  because you burn them up with nitrogen.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:59):**  If we don't back down nitrogen,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:00):**  you're never going to build carbon.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:01):**  How can a farm be conventional?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:02):**  All those years and put all those corn stalks  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:05):**  back in the ground and keep knifing an anhydrous  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:07):**  and this organic matter at best stabilized  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:09):**  and it hasn't dropped.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:10):**  Residues didn't build it up,  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:12):**  nitrogen burnt it up and there were no till.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah, it's interesting how you mentioned Don Schrieffer.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:17):**  One of the things that Don Schrieffer wrote about  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:19):**  in his books, Agriculture in Transition  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:22):**  and From the Soil Up was that the fastest way  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:24):**  to build soil organic matter is to grow corn.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:27):**  And today we think that growing corn  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:29):**  depletes soil organic matter.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:31):**  It's not about the crop, it's about the way we manage  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:33):**  the nutrition and particularly the nitrogen  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:35):**  within that crop.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:36):**  That's right.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:37):**  So that's why my taxing in nitrogen at the University  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:39):**  says 1.1 pound of nitro-rebushel of corn.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:41):**  We are guys operating at 0.7, 0.5 I've seen out here.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:45):**  They're still cornbean farmers,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:47):**  but they've got much more efficient  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:48):**  than they've got their mineral levels and their biology up.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:52):**  Gary, very enjoyable having you here.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:54):**  Thank you for sharing  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:55):**  and we look forward to having you back soon.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:57):**  Yeah, I would love to get in some other topics  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:59):**  with you sometime, John.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:00):**  And keep up the good work.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:01):**  It's always a pleasure to visit with you.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:04):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:07):**  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:11):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:15):**  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:18):**  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:22):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:25):**  and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:28):**  we must first think differently about agriculture,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:31):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:35):**  about regeneration versus degeneration.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:38):**  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:41):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:43):**  and make more money with less risk.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:46):**  Thank you for listening.

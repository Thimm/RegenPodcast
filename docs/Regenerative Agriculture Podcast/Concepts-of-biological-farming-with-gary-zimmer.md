### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (2018-11-09)  
### Author(s): John Kempf  

**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John.  I'm passionate about developing  regenerative agriculture systems  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:06):**  that improve soil health,  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:11):**  and produce food of such an exceptional quality  that we can have a legitimate conversation  about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:18):**  I've been fortunate to meet many people  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:24):**  However, much of this knowledge and information  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:31):**  that have not been widely shared.  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:39):**  and incorporate it into products and growing systems  that growers can easily put into practice.  It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:46):**  regenerative agriculture systems  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which all other growing systems  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:53):**  are compared.  To achieve this goal, I want to share the knowledge  that we have learned in the last decade  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:58):**  and make it available to everyone.  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:05):**  And when they're properly applied,  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:11):**  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,  or topics of ideas that you would like for me to discuss,  please connect on social media or email me,

**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:28):**  Hope you enjoy and thank you for listening.  Hi friends, I'm here with a consultant  and one of the original co-founders of Midwestern BioAg,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:36):**  Gary Zimmer, who has been a leader  in the biological farming field for many years,  several decades, and was one of my original mentors  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:45):**  in getting started.  Gary, thank you very much for being here with us today.  I'm very honored to have you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:49):**  That's my pleasure.  Look forward to our discussion.  Gary, you've done a lot of work over the years  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:55):**  in many different areas,  obviously with your background in dairy and nutrition  and the work that you've done with Midwestern BioAg.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:01):**  What are some of the really memorable moments  that led you to where you are today?  I think it really started out,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:08):**  of course there was a lot of questioning  going back on in the 70s.  We got to go way back that far.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:13):**  I was teaching at a technical college  and I got introduced to the fact  that what we put on the fields affected the feed  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:20):**  that we fed the cows.  And that was like, oh my gosh,  that meant that we could change feeds.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:25):**  I think prior to that time,  most dairy people would ever feed the farmer grew  and they would just take a sample  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:32):**  and add what was short or dilute it down  to try to make a ration.  And then we realized we could change that feed.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:37):**  And then if you think about it,  we ought to be able to change food.  We ought to be able to change a lot of things we consume  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:42):**  by getting healthier soils, better mineral balance.  And so that was one of the real moments  of changing my career.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:48):**  And then I teaching at the technical college,  I was a dairy nutrition guy,  but I had to do soils and agronomy and farm finance.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:55):**  And so I brought in outside speakers  and my next kind of a moment was I was introduced  to Brookside Laboratory Farms out of New Knoxville, Ohio.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:02):**  Back in those days, they were a pretty big force  in Southeastern Minnesota where I was.  And I learned an awful lot for some really good mentors.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:09):**  I always picked people.  I didn't create or develop too much.  I paid a lot of attention.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:14):**  And I think as time goes on,  we all got better at understanding soils and soil health.  I had some really good teachers in the beginning  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:20):**  through that Brookside experience.  Gary, there's a lot of conversation around  how we need healthy soils to produce healthy plants  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:29):**  and produce healthy food for people.  And I sometimes hear people just saying  that that link is weak to describe.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:36):**  And so question that I have for you  as a dairy nutritionist,  how much can we impact food quality  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:42):**  by impacting soil health?  And does it really make a difference for animals?  And by extension, do you believe  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:47):**  it really makes a difference for people?  Yes, I think it starts possibly  with finding limiting mineral factors.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:53):**  Like I always said, way back in the old days,  we were under the assumption that N was N and P was P  and K was K and pHs were fine.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:01):**  Well, then we began to realize  that the sources of those minerals in this whole thing,  if I had to define soil health  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:06):**  and soil fertility thrown into that discussion,  it's the exchange of those nutrients.  And calcium is really kind of king,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:13):**  not having the right pH,  but having the right available levels of calcium.  So soil health is really having a biological balance,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:20):**  a mineral balance and a beautiful structure,  loose, crumbly kind of chocolate cake,  kind of a structure to have this all happen in.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:27):**  So how do you achieve that?  And I think there's some really guideline principles.  I know way back when I wrote my first book,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:33):**  we came up with the rules of biological farming  and now they have the rules of what soil health is.  But I think there's a lot of common sense, common ground.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:40):**  I mean, you gotta have a variety of crops.  You can't have a crust.  You can't have packed ground.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:44):**  You can't over till it.  And there's all kinds of factors  that affect what makes that thing work.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:50):**  And then of course, the thing that's hardest for people  to understand is this mineral thing.  Just because you have minerals dumped on the soil  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:56):**  does not mean the plant gets them  in the right kind of a portion.  And sometimes one interferes with another.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:01):**  And I think that's a hard one  that still needs a lot of work.  But yes, having that all said,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:06):**  it does really impact our feed for our cattle  because the minerals coming through the feed that we created,  we would get a 50% higher mineral uptake into our oranges.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:16):**  Those minerals are much more biologically available  to the animal than adding a stone.  I say, as a human, if I said,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:24):**  I'm not getting enough nutrition and minerals,  and I'm gonna take all these supplements.  Well, are we designed to utilize those supplements  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:30):**  like we are designed to utilize the stuff  that should be in our food?  Exactly.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:35):**  One of the things that we've observed  over the last couple of years  as we've started using a lot of sap analysis,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:39):**  speaking to your comments on mineral balance  is that in many cases,  the nutrient imbalances that crops experiencing,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:47):**  particularly nutrient deficiencies are a direct result  of the excesses of the products that growers apply.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:55):**  I just, no question about it.  That's why these guys that dump on lots of nitrogen  or potassium, and then with that potassium  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:01):**  comes a lot of chloride in their salt form fertilizer.  They are definitely interfering with calcium.  And so the interference of the magnesium uptake,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:09):**  I think that's absolutely right.  And that's the other thing you brought up,  this sap analysis, just because you got a soil test  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:15):**  and some labs says everything is ideal.  You and I both know that that doesn't necessarily translate  into the plant having an ideal.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:22):**  It's guys that are driving these high healthy,  high yielding crops.  How are they paying attention to minerals?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:28):**  The levels that were determined by some lab  was based on what an average crop  and they're using a lot of plant protective compounds.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:34):**  So what would those numbers and ratios look like?  And I'm sure you've seen a lot of things  in your testing and career that it isn't quite as simple  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:41):**  as just grabbing a salt test and putting something on.  Our goal as farmers should not be to create  a pretty looking soil test.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:49):**  It needs to be to grow a really great crop.  And yeah, I think that's been the fallacy sometimes  where soil analysis are used as the goal  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:56):**  rather than as a measuring stick or where we wanna go.  And that was why in my career and in my books,  I try to get it simplified so people can understand  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:07):**  and that's why separating out soil correction  from crop fertilizer, I think was a really good move  on farmers understanding it.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:16):**  They get a salt test back, I had a call this morning  from a producer and they said,  well, our salt test looks pretty good.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:20):**  Does that mean we don't do anything?  I said, well, that means that if that salt test was correct,  that means you don't have anything major to correct.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:28):**  But we still, certain things like the boron, the sulfur,  soluble calcium, there's certain things we still need  to feed the crop and that soil has a certain ability  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:36):**  to dish out minerals and how do we provide  all those extra other things that, like you said,  ratios and excesses we put on interfered with.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:45):**  Gary, you mentioned the three foundational pieces,  biology, minerals and structure, managing soil biology,  soil mineral balance and soil structure.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:54):**  Which of those three have you found the most challenging  to address and the most challenging to resolve?  Probably gets back to the misunderstandings.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:03):**  Like I said, I think we do understand today the biology.  We called my company Midwestern BioEgg  because of the fact I wanted them to focus on biology.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:12):**  But just because you focus on it,  now what do we do about it?  I think the minerals are probably the easiest.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:16):**  But then we still gotta decide  how much to put on and what source.  Biology and tillage kind of the physical  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:23):**  all kind of work together.  If you feed the soil a decent amount of different kinds  of carbons, then you gotta say, what kind of carbons?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:30):**  How do I manage them?  Do I just leave them lay on top?  Do I challenge them?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:34):**  You got all these questions and progress sometimes is slow.  But so I think there's a real struggle  is trying to find the farmers to find  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:41):**  what their limiting factor is.  And of course they're limited on budgets  and then to give it time.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:46):**  But I would probably say that of all the things  that's the hardest would be getting biology to work.  Cause in order to get biology to work,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:52):**  that does provide my structure if I have that really working.  That's probably the hard part to understand.  Yeah, and that's been our experience as well  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:00):**  is that the biology has been the most difficult to get going.  And in my observation,  it's actually become more difficult over the years.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:08):**  It's harder now to regenerate biology  than it was 10 years ago when I started.  And I wonder what the implications are  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:15):**  of continuing herbicide and pesticide applications  and whether they might be contributing to that challenge.  We took on another farm, my family farms and were organic.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:26):**  And we took on this land and there wasn't a weed growing out  it had been chemicaled, heavy, heavy, heavy  for lots and lots of years.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:33):**  In the first year, there's not a weed out there.  And then we grew some crops and we put our fertility on.  And of course it seems to be struggling a little bit.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:40):**  And then we took it through a transition to organic  and grew some cover crops,  but there was no weeds went to seed.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:44):**  So this fall we had a crop, a small grain in there  and then we put a nice cover crop in following it.  The weeds are everywhere.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:51):**  So what it looks to me like the soil came alive  and those little seeds have been laying out there  suppressed by chemistry are now back trying to work.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:59):**  And it was this really an interesting kind of thing  as word that those weed seeds didn't get dropped on there.  I just think that we had that thing  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:06):**  so suppressed with chemistry  that the biology wasn't functioning.  So whether weeds or plants I'm trying to grow,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:11):**  it came back alive is what I see out here.  And so you're right.  And that's why as a dairy nutritionist  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:17):**  and when I started this business, we only worked in  cause we had a lot of small family dairy farmers  which a lot of them are gone now, which is sad to see.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:24):**  But a dairy farm because of manure use  and because of rotation, because having forages in line  and because they weren't such heavy chemical users  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:31):**  they were already half biological when we started.  Yeah, it is amazing what forages  and what having a bit more crop diversity  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:37):**  can do in the system.  You know that in the state of Iowa,  anything that is not corn and soybeans  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:42):**  is considered a specialty crop.  Alfalfa is considered a specialty crop.  Wow, I just drove all the way out to Nebraska last week.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:49):**  That's right, there's nothing but corn and beans there.  So there probably are specialty crops.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:55):**  In the wealth and the depth of experience that you have had,  what has been something that really surprised you?  Things I guess are really surprising me to now.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:04):**  I've seemed like I've been at this for 35 years  struggling away and maybe got into more specialty thing.  Couple of things,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:10):**  because everybody's brother wants to get in organic now  because they want the money  but they don't understand the system.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:14):**  But I think the movement about soil health  and seeing NRCS get involved  and really push hard on this soil health,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:21):**  yet I wouldn't necessarily agree 100% with them,  is at least it's bringing up the discussion  about the value of soil health and water infiltration  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:30):**  and all these things.  And that's a kind of a real surprise to me  to see that that would happen on a conventional thing  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:37):**  that they wouldn't be talking about soil health.  And they would be asking some of the questions  that we've been asking for many, many years.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:43):**  And now I see it in my world.  I see so many conventional farms.  They used to kind of not laugh at us,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:51):**  but they just thought,  well, where's the research behind it?  Now they're asking all kinds of really good questions  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:56):**  and paying attention.  That's been a real big surprise to me.  I didn't expect to see that in my lifetime.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah, we're seeing a tremendous shift as well  and tremendous desire for information.  Continuing with that thought,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:09):**  you're surprised that people are inquiring  and because of the different perspective  that you've had in the past,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:15):**  could you elaborate a little bit on that?  What is something that you believe to be true  about modern agriculture  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:20):**  that is very different from the mainstream view?  So modern agriculture to me is this,  I think what really changed some factors,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:27):**  not necessarily economically is that,  see way back when I was at Brookside,  I can sell in 1976.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:34):**  I stood on a farm in Northern Illinois  growing 375 bushel corn  with a public variety of corn  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:39):**  from University of Illinois on 40 inch rows.  And you could stick your hand in the ground,  clear your elbow.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:44):**  And this guy was his pet little project.  I stood there and saw it.  And of course I got my attention.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:49):**  Then in the nineties, of course,  in Iowa, there's somebody grew there  300 or some bushel corn.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:54):**  These guys that are growing the 400 to 500 bushel corn  have really opened up the doors,  I think to say that there's much more potential.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:01):**  See, I started my business back in the early eighties  by leasing a fertilizer facility in Northern Illinois.  But we did very little business in Illinois.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:08):**  The soils are so good.  That's all you gotta do is knife in anhydrous.  And if you got seeds in the hopper,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:14):**  you're gonna get 150 bushel corn.  Well, now they're saying $12,000 an acre land  and all these things out here.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:20):**  And so they're all chasing 300 bushel corn now.  So we actually built a new fertilizer facility in Illinois  and hadn't done much business.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:26):**  They're part of that.  But there's a whole new group.  I like my strip till kind of farms for conventional.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:31):**  At least I can get that zone done right.  A lot of that land is rented.  Nobody wants to fix it, but that whole kind of a thing.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:38):**  So now is that transition to become conventional?  That was why I find it kind of offensive when people say,  how are we gonna feed all these people?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:47):**  And I say, 40% of our corn goes into making ethanol.  And we have the capability of doubling our yields  and we can do it on a cleaner method of farming.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:55):**  It's not that we can't produce more food  and of course people don't even eat necessarily  corn and beans.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:59):**  We can do a lot of things if we wanna feed these people.  But I think that conventional agriculture,  if we want to whatever we wanna call it  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:06):**  or modern agriculture, what is mainstream?  And I think mainstream is shifting  to a biological farming system.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:13):**  And that is exciting.  It certainly is.  And there's a lot of questions out here.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:18):**  And I guess I was just at a Nebraska  and it was a little shocking to me.  They did an organic field.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:25):**  They all these guys wanna get an organic for the money.  And what the whole group was actually thinking about  was just shuffling resources.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:30):**  Instead of buying an insecticide,  let's buy an organic insecticide.  Let's buy one that's certified.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:35):**  They kind of missed the whole point about soil health,  but they'll get there eventually  if they're gonna make this work.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:40):**  Input substitution, very organic.  If you're gonna buy organic nitrogen,  you're gonna find out that whatever you get paid  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:45):**  for the product you grow isn't gonna be enough.  You better figure out how to make the system work.  Gary, one of the questions that I get asked sometime,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:53):**  there have been other stories about  extraordinary historical yields.  Don Huber describes how a team that he was working with  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:00):**  was producing 450 plus bushel per acre corn  back in the late 70s.  And you've just described 375 bushel corn 40 years ago.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:08):**  What happened with that technology and with those ideas?  Why did we lose all that knowledge and information  over the last 40 years?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:15):**  I think what happened is like in that case,  articles in the paper came out  and they said he put on 400 pounds of nitrogen  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:21):**  and 200 pounds of phosphorous and all these kinds of things.  And they didn't really understand the fact  that that guy had an impact on soil health.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:28):**  Like I said, you can stick your arm in the ground  clear to your elbow.  And the other thing they didn't understand  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:31):**  that a lot of that input came from manure and stuff.  It wasn't from commercial fertilizer.  So they were still under the mindset  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:38):**  that just putting on the commercial fertilizer did it.  So the guys that went at it  and dumped on enough commercial fertilizer  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:44):**  to match his numbers didn't get the yields  because they missed the other factor  that in that livestock manure,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:49):**  there was a biological link  and there was also other trace minerals and things.  It wasn't just N, B and K.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:54):**  So I think they didn't, it was at that time,  it was a lack of understanding  what takes this system to work.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:58):**  And that's why it took a lot of years.  And I think these master corn growing things  and people started experimenting with things.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:04):**  And so just like out here now,  can we ever achieve the results that these guys talk about  without all the intervention of chemistry anywhere  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:12):**  and without a rotation and different varieties of plants  to put out there?  And I don't really think so.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:17):**  I think we need cover crops in between  or we need another crop.  See, I think to change agriculture,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:23):**  it's really kind of simple.  We need to subsidize something besides corn and beans.  If they could just grow a small grain  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:28):**  and then put a cover crop in afterwards,  now I got that nutrient in this carbon biological cycle.  And so it's not just chemistry,  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:35):**  it's how the nutrients are delivered to the plant  and then in the ratios.  Gary, if you were president for a day  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:41):**  or for longer than that,  and you had the capacity to influence change in agriculture,  what are the things that you would change?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:47):**  Well, first thing I would do is I would tax nitrogen  so high that they couldn't afford to use very much of it.  That's a step in the right direction.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:56):**  And the second thing I would do is I would subsidize  a small grain.  If we want to truly feed the people  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:01):**  that are starving in the world,  they eat wheat better than they eat corn  or maybe got issues with wheat out here  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:05):**  because this gluten thing,  but I think we've done things to wheat  that are probably caused that.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:09):**  So anyway, I subsidize some small grain  so that gives the farmer that rotation  and then tax nitrogen really high.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:18):**  And I would make changes on our environment and food.  And I'd have guys scrambling to figure out  then the cover crops we brought forward.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:25):**  I don't want to subsidize cubs, crops.  I want to subsidize something,  something of food that grows the world  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:29):**  and let them figure it out.  Because otherwise if you just give them money  to grow a cover crop,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:33):**  they never really figure out the system.  And so if they have to figure out how to grow nitrogen,  if they have to figure out how to get the plants healthier.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:39):**  And so my thing as a president of the day is really simple.  I said, I don't think it's that hard to change agriculture.  It's just what we put our focus on.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:46):**  Yeah.  There's a few key leverage points.  Exactly.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:51):**  Gary, you have a lot of experience with boots on the ground,  working with many different farmers from all over the world.  Often I find that there are a few key success factors  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:59):**  on a farm that growers may often overlook  or may not be paying attention to  that you have the benefit of insights on  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:05):**  having observed many different operations.  What would you say are some of the  often overlooked factors to success?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:13):**  I think one of the things is that,  as I just started on this big project over in Eastern Europe,  if you start with a soil,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:19):**  if you've got soils over there  that are fairly high levels of calcium  or decent levels of calcium to begin with,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:25):**  that's a real benefit as compared to if you start  with a high magnesium, low calcium,  or high potassium or high sodium kind of thing.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:32):**  And the other thing is that boots on the ground thing,  and that's where my rotation, Eastern Europe,  those guys probably got six or seven different crops they grow  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:40):**  and that variety of different crops.  Some of them taken off early, some late,  they're growing rye in afterwards.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:45):**  And so in the world where you run into an area,  I always tell our consultants,  you need to predict your success.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:50):**  Almost like saying a dairy farmer's a halfway  to being a biological farmer.  I think the basis of all they start with,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:56):**  because they don't necessarily understand the nutrient input  and the variety of crops they grow,  the variations of crops they grow.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:03):**  So that's why huge, big things  on soil health are crop variation.  It took me a long time in my career  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:09):**  because I didn't have much of a mentor back in the old days.  I read a lot of Albert papers.  I read books all the time,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:15):**  Steiner's and everybody else's,  but the mentoring part that comes along  with how do you learn some of these things?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:20):**  It took me a long time to figure out  that the plants determine the biology.  Why else would you have to rotate?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:26):**  So diseases, the insects, the plants that digest corn,  don't digest alfalfa.  So this doggy dog biological balance in the soil,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:34):**  it's accidentally put in place on a lot of farms.  Let's say they put on manure as input,  or they got this crop rotation,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:40):**  is a huge step forward in their success.  Because then they got diversity feed,  diversity biology, and it eliminates a lot of their problems.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:48):**  I think this goes back to the discussion  that we were having earlier  about what is the most challenging thing to fix,  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:54):**  being biology in the soil profile.  And so there's this entire discussion in agriculture  that it takes a healthy soil to grow a healthy plant.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:01):**  And I think what we may have missed  is that the fastest way to develop a healthy soil  is to grow really healthy plants.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:08):**  Yes.  And that's really interesting  because I'm involved with this project  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:11):**  out in South Dakota, this large organic transition thing.  And I say, if I go to a farm  and they're not capable of growing a beautiful alfalfa,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:19):**  as an example, or a beautiful cover crop.  So just saying I got a cover crop  and the plants are one per square yard,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:25):**  doesn't really, I want it thick and lush and beautiful.  And then you gotta be willing to feed it to the soil  at the stage of growth that it affects the biology  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:33):**  in the soil for the outcome you want.  So in other words, if I wanna grow a crop like corn  that recovers a lot of soluble nutrients,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:39):**  the crop I'm growing previous to the cover crop,  when I'm feeding the soil biology,  better be highly digestible and young and succulent.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:45):**  It's like, we always say, it's like feeding a cow  if I wanna get 100 pounds of milk.  I wanna feed a legume,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:50):**  I could feed a more mature complex plant  that would feed maybe more of a fungal population  and wouldn't provide all the soluble nutrients.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:57):**  So then the plant itself would go to work  and the biology would work with it.  And so there's all that kind of understanding  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:04):**  that I think has to take place within this system.  Gary, what is something that you wish all farmers knew?  I wish they knew and could stand back  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:14):**  and see this whole farming thing as a system.  That's a, it's got all these little moving parts  and then their job becomes identifying limiting factors  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:23):**  or constraints within their system and fixing them.  And so if they don't understand that,  they just understand it's chemistry and nutrients and crop.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:31):**  And I think most farmers in their mind,  I mean, they just think, well, the bugs are in the air  and they're coming through, so I better spray.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:38):**  I was out in England and they developed something  at Cambridge University, as you put on the corner  of your farm that measures fungal spores.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:44):**  If the fungal spore gets to a certain height, you spray.  And I said, really?  That means if I was on an airplane,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:49):**  they put a monitor in the airplane,  if the disease bugs are certain high enough,  I would be taking the antibiotic.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:53):**  Is that the same analogy?  I mean, it's like plants can defend and protect themselves  and farmers don't understand that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:59):**  They don't understand that trace windows  can do a lot to protect and make your plant healthier.  And that nitrogen is a negative on fungal diseases  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:06):**  and causing trouble.  They don't understand that they have an impact  on soil, on plant health.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:11):**  They don't really understand that.  They still get their conventional mindset  that every time there's a problem, you spray it.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:16):**  Almost like an analogy would be,  what in the world gave people the idea  that we could buy a jug full of bugs,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:23):**  dump it on the land and everything would be great?  Why won't those bugs survive?  They aren't there now, why aren't they there now?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:30):**  They said they extract natural organisms from healthy soils  and put them on an unhealthy soil.  Why would you think that would work?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:37):**  Why wouldn't we change what we did on the unhealthy soil?  Exactly, and what makes you think  that they're going to survive  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:43):**  if you don't give them a food source?  Yeah, and they might see a bushel or two gain  from doing this, they might see a little bit,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:48):**  but that's not fixing the system.  Gary, for myself, the places that I've learned the most  are the places where something didn't work.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:57):**  When things don't work, you have to really dig in  and try to figure out and understand why they didn't work.  What are some experiences that you've had  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:03):**  where things didn't work the way you expected?  Yes, probably suspecting that if we just put on some calcium  or some balanced fertility that we would have  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:15):**  less of a disease or insect problem.  I think just like we go onto our ground  and let's say the nematode population was excessive  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:21):**  and we didn't recognize or identify it  and we're trying to do these wonderful things,  but they're still out there.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:25):**  We haven't changed that whole part.  And so I think we've seen the fact  that you've got to earn the right  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:30):**  not to use an insecticide or fungicide.  So when we had failures that maybe we were jumping the gun  too far ahead and the farmer was anxious  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:37):**  to be able to get rid of some of those costs.  And then of course we had failures  and it's hard to identify.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:40):**  Like people says, oh, there's a nutritional deficiency  out here.  I said, yeah, but someone just ate the roots off.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:46):**  Yeah.  Gary, you've written a couple of books  and do you have another book coming out?  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:55):**  Are you working on a third one?  The third book I'm working on is just really right now  is just totally different.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:02):**  It's the Frank Lloyd Wright Taliesin farm  that we farm here in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  Got a lot of visitors.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:07):**  We're writing a book about the history of agriculture,  farming yesterday, today and tomorrow,  which gives me a chance to go through the history  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:13):**  of agriculture in our community  and do it as an educational thing.  So that farm was 40 years under a rented,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:19):**  heavy chemical input rundown.  Nobody fixed anything.  And it goes, now we've been farming for 20 years,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:24):**  but where's the future of that kind of land?  That last book that when I just came out with a year ago,  when I revised my first biological farm book,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:32):**  it's now a 500 page thing.  I'm done with that book.  I don't ever want to read it.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:35):**  I don't ever want to rewrite it again.  That's enough.  But I do want to do a dairy nutrition.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:41):**  I am a dairy nutritionist.  There's a high forage dairy farm.  We just took our dairy herd on our farm  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:45):**  and took all the grain away.  See anything you add to the cow's diets,  what's missing in the forages.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:50):**  Now, granted, we probably won't get as much milk,  but we ought to be in a healthy production.  So now I'm playing this game of what kind of forages  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:56):**  and at what kind of ratios is it going to take  to make a high producing or healthy producing  at the maximum level we can.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:02):**  And the more success we have,  when you take all the tools away, like grains,  the more success we're going to have  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:08):**  by obviously getting more energy and more nutrition  into the food we grow.  So it'll have a lot of angles on it.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:13):**  So that down the road someday,  when I get that all put together,  that'll be my book that I want to do  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:18):**  is about high forage dairy farming.  Let's talk about that a little bit more.  Obviously the limitation that you have  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:24):**  in removing grains from dairy is energy.  So how do you produce high enough energy forage  that you can safely remove grains?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:31):**  So now there are certain plant species that will help us,  but again, it's this balance  of getting enough active calcium up.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:36):**  We've seen the sugar levels and refractomers and things.  We saw the soluble carbohydrates,  I shouldn't say sugar levels.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:42):**  We can get a big solid stem, non-alpha,  and get more pectins into that plant.  We can raise that energy level.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:47):**  Really, that's why cows and soot,  that's why cows and soils are so much alike.  And that's why as a dairy nutritionist,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:53):**  those easy to do soils and cows,  we call, we got to balance energy to protein.  To get high digestible feeds in the dairy cow,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:59):**  we always struggle with excess protein.  Then they're on the Atkins diet,  which burns up their energy.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:04):**  We have to get the right kinds of forages  that are going to make sure we got our energy  in line with our protein.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:09):**  And we got to have them highly digestible.  But we can have an impact on any specific plant  on the amount of energy it takes in.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:16):**  Like now, the modern day farms,  if you want to call these big mega farms,  they feed an unbelievable amount of corn silage.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:22):**  And they're putting a lot of energy into the cows.  And they can get a lot of milk out of the cows.  Of course, the cows don't survive very long.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:27):**  And I question the quality of the milk  and the fatty acid makeup of it.  So we can have a profitable, healthy herd of cows  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:34):**  is our belief and opinion.  And right now, a lot of the guys  that are all forages on the dairy herd  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:39):**  don't get enough milk volume to pay their bills.  It's easy to feed grain.  It's not so easy when it's gone and say,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:46):**  I got to get it all out of my feeds now.  And I can't violate the principles of that cow.  It needs energy to protein balance.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:52):**  It needs certain minerals.  How do I avoid excessive minerals when it's all forages?  Like you said, excess impacts more damage probably  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:59):**  than the deficiencies do.  And that's true for soils and cows.  So that's why it's a real big challenge  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:04):**  to take that grain away.  Well, a lot of the grazing dairy herds out here  that are all forages get about 8,000 pounds of milk.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:10):**  And we were at 20,000 pound herd average  when we went and took the grain away just six months ago.  And yes, we've dropped in milk.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:17):**  Again, it's a whole system from genetics.  We've been breeding for a smaller, bigger body capacity,  taking food capacity out.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:24):**  And the heifers that we're having calved this fall  that were raised without grain are totally different  than the ones that you take the grain away from.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:31):**  Wow.  So that's why I find it challenging and fun to learn.  And I always hoped that we could get a 12 to 15,000 pound  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:37):**  herd average on all forages.  That's our goal.  And if we can do that and have cows healthy  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:41):**  and have a high quality milk,  I think the consumers questioning food all the time.  And that's why grass fed beef and grass fed  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:48):**  is really getting a lot of attention.  But if that cow is unhealthy and sick eating grasses,  that does not make a good quality product.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:55):**  Yeah, it does not.  And the other interesting piece is we have this tremendous  dairy overproduction here in the country.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:01):**  If we had a substantial number of farmers,  perhaps lowering production a little bit  and trying to produce a healthier, higher quality milk,  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:07):**  that might also fix the milk consumption problem as well.  Yes, I agree 100%.  It's just like now in the corn world and bean world,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:15):**  they're all shopping to get more yields,  maybe at an environmental cost  because they can't pay their bills,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:20):**  but then they spud the market more  and then they really won't be able to pay their bills.  I think you're right.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:25):**  So I said, if everybody went like we did,  we dropped three, 4,000, 5,000 pounds of milk on our cows.  We've now taken some of the surplus off the market.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:32):**  If a lot of people did that,  we wouldn't have a surplus if we figure this out.  So it's comfortable.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:36):**  That's my role to make it more comfortable  for people to change to an all forage diet.  That's what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah.  Gary, in addition to the books that you have written,  what is a book or resource  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:46):**  that you would recommend most often to growers?  I think about that quite a bit.  And the ones that I mentored with  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:52):**  and what people really want to read is,  Acres USA is still a prime magazine for me.  I probably get 15 magazines a month.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:59):**  I actually enjoy reading a strip till and no till magazines.  There's an interesting amount of information  that people are starting to bring up and talk about.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:06):**  You gotta be able to put it in their perspective  and you gotta be able to read between the lines  on that kind of stuff.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:11):**  So for organic, I like my Moses conference.  We have here in Wisconsin.  There's a lot of resources and people there.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:18):**  And I think if you gotta get yourself educated,  I think you gotta live your life under the fact  of being under the opinion instead of opinionated.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:25):**  I don't really care what your opinion is  and people shouldn't care what my opinion is,  but they should recognize  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:30):**  what your life experience has brought forward  and say, how does that fit in my farming operation?  How can I adopt some of those concepts and ideas?  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:37):**  I was a really big student of Don Schrieffer years ago.  He taught me a lot about soil health and physics  and the strip till kind of a system all came from him.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:45):**  And that was a real big aspect of it.  So I've read a lot of books and there's a lot  you can add to that that comes from that acres library  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:50):**  out here that I think would help people  get a better understanding.  And education is still the thing that gives you the comfort  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:57):**  and the ability to recognize that, yes,  this is a constraint on my farmer.  No, that's probably not.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:03):**  Indeed.  Gary, you have such a wealth of experience.  We could take this conversation  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:07):**  in so many different directions.  So what is the question that you wish I would have asked?  What's the topic that you think is important to speak about?  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:14):**  I think we covered a lot of base.  What would really be missing from our discussion out here?  Is it necessary to get in more detail?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:21):**  I'm always interested in the things that you're doing  with these SAP analysis and the products you're doing  and when you're doing them and how for specialty  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:28):**  kind of crops or whatever they would be.  I guess, did we get in enough detail?  I'm always one of the guys that said  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:34):**  before you get to the detail,  you better understand the big picture.  And so I don't know, John,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:38):**  I think we've covered a lot of the basis  from my life experiences.  I spent my life in career trying to transition  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:45):**  a lot of conventional thinkers  into a more biological mindset  without giving them so much detail.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:50):**  They get bogged down and lose sight of the fact  that they're not looking for some muck of magic out here  that they don't lose sight of the base.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:56):**  Did we cover that well enough?  I think we asked those questions enough  so I don't really have any further answer  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:02):**  as to what we could have done better  or could have covered more.  Well, I think there's always the need  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:08):**  to have more of those detailed conversations as well.  And so I would love to invite you back into the podcast  at some point very soon to dive into  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:18):**  some of those more specific conversations.  It's very important because there are many growers who,  as you described earlier,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:24):**  we're open to the system, we want to learn the system.  And of course, learning and understanding the system  is all about understanding the details  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:31):**  that comprise that system.  Yes.  So yeah, I would love to have you back  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:35):**  for more of those conversations  and I'm looking forward to that.  In my lifetime, when we first started out  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:40):**  this fertilizer business,  it was about choosing better qualities.  Instead of potassium chloride, we use potassium sulfate.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:45):**  Instead of DAP, rather, we use MAP and rock phosphate.  And so we chose better sources  instead of using oxide traceracers, we use sulfates.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:53):**  Well, then as time went on,  we started manufacturing fertilizers  and got involved with carbon-based fertilizers,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:59):**  trying to mimic what mother nature would do,  if we want to call it that,  by taking minerals up in plants  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:04):**  and having biology or food hooked to that.  So that's another whole discussion as to  how can we deliver minerals and sources  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:10):**  and ways through this carbon thing.  I think carbon linked with fertilizer  is not only more efficient.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:16):**  I just read a report the other day  that put a tracer on nitrogen  and found out that only about 25%  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:21):**  of the nitrogen these farmers actually apply  is sucked up into that plant.  The rest of it is either lost or going through biology  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:27):**  or hooked into some carbon somewhere along the way.  Doesn't surprise me at all.  When we've started using SAP analysis on farms  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:34):**  to see what plants are actually truly absorbing  on many farms, I would say on most farms  that we begin working with,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:41):**  we can cut nitrogen application rates  from 30 to 50% or more with no decrease  in the nitrogen levels in the plant.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:49):**  Yeah, and we brought it up a little before I did see,  people got to realize that just some of the projects  we're involved with,  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:54):**  if we truly want to sequester carbons,  we got to back off nitrogen  because you burn them up with nitrogen.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:59):**  If we don't back down nitrogen,  you're never going to build carbon.  How can a farm be conventional?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:02):**  All those years and put all those corn stalks  back in the ground and keep knifing an anhydrous  and this organic matter at best stabilized  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:09):**  and it hasn't dropped.  Residues didn't build it up,  nitrogen burnt it up and there were no till.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah, it's interesting how you mentioned Don Schrieffer.  One of the things that Don Schrieffer wrote about  in his books, Agriculture in Transition  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:22):**  and From the Soil Up was that the fastest way  to build soil organic matter is to grow corn.  And today we think that growing corn  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:29):**  depletes soil organic matter.  It's not about the crop, it's about the way we manage  the nutrition and particularly the nitrogen  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:35):**  within that crop.  That's right.  So that's why my taxing in nitrogen at the University  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:39):**  says 1.1 pound of nitro-rebushel of corn.  We are guys operating at 0.7, 0.5 I've seen out here.  They're still cornbean farmers,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:47):**  but they've got much more efficient  than they've got their mineral levels and their biology up.  Exactly.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:52):**  Gary, very enjoyable having you here.  Thank you for sharing  and we look forward to having you back soon.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:57):**  Yeah, I would love to get in some other topics  with you sometime, John.  And keep up the good work.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:01):**  It's always a pleasure to visit with you.  This podcast was brought to you by a great company  that I work for, AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:11):**  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:22):**  We believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests  and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  we must first think differently about agriculture,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:31):**  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,  about regeneration versus degeneration.  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/concepts-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:41):**  that help growers produce higher quality yield  and make more money with less risk.  Thank you for listening.

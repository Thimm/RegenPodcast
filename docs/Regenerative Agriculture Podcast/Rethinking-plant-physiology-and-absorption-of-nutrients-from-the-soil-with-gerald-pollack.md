**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:04:58):**  water and his research work has been described as perhaps having been the most innovative breakthrough  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:04):**  in science in the 21st century. And I think certainly for agriculture, it has the potential  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:10):**  to be that because his research in water, plants, and animal bodies and our own bodies are all  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:16):**  primarily composed of water. And the understanding that he has developed really changes the way that  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:21):**  we need to think about cellular metabolism. So Jerry, we're very excited to have you and looking

**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:32):**  Not Washington State University, which is in Pullman in Eastern Washington and is famous

**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:41):**  famous, which is located in Seattle. And so there are so many universities with the name Washington  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:47):**  that it's really confusing. There's another one called Washington University, not University of

**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:05:57):**  somewhere in DC. And then even within the state of Washington, there's Western Washington University,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:06:03):**  Eastern Washington University, Central Washington University, and probably myriad more throughout

**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:06:25):**  all. I guess his name is so revered that people consider it a distinction to name their university  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:06:32):**  after him. Anyway, thanks for inviting me. Happy to be on and happy to share what we know about  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:06:38):**  water and other aspects of life. There are a couple of important pieces here. You've written

**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:07:27):**  water has three phases, the solid, the ice, the liquid, and the vapor. And I learned that,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:07:33):**  you learned that, we all learned that. On the other hand, many years ago, a suggestion was made

**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:08:58):**  And most of what he's written points to evidence that there is another, he doesn't call it a phase  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:09:03):**  of water, but he calls it structured water. That is where the molecules are not bouncing around  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:09:10):**  randomly and pointed in every which way, but they're ordered. They're like dipoles,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:09:16):**  you know, little plus and minus at either end and all these dipoles are lined up with one another.

**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:09:54):**  is, life is water dancing to the tune of solids. So he knew that water was centrally involved in  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:10:02):**  everything to do with living systems. And so that's when we started. And that was preface

**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:10:39):**  component of water inside of gels, a side point. So it's an ordered phase where the molecules are  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:10:46):**  lined up a bit different from what Gilbert Ling had put forth about dipoles organizing themselves.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:10:53):**  It has a different structure. I can tell you about it later if you want. And it has, unlike ordinary  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:01):**  water, which is neutral, this has a negative charge, usually a negative charge. And it's built  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:07):**  by energy. You need some kind of energy to build order. And this is ordered. And the energy actually  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:14):**  comes from light, particularly infrared light. And infrared light is all around us. If you were to

**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:27):**  dark adapted, you can't see anything. If you were to take out an infrared camera and create an image  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:33):**  of all this, you get a beautiful image because everything is emitting infrared energy. And it's  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:38):**  used as a nightlight, especially for military purposes. So this energy is all around us. It's

**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:11:58):**  we found that when water meets a surface, particularly surfaces that are hydrophilic,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:05):**  and that means water-loving, means if the surface were like a desk or something, dropped a droplet  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:11):**  of water on it, the water would spread out, as opposed to hydrophobic or water-fearing,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:17):**  in which case the water beads up and jerks away from the surface because it doesn't like it,  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:21):**  it fears it. So usually, not everyone, but most hydrophilic surfaces, when water meets these  
**[0:12:28-0:12:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:28):**  surfaces, the water, it transitions from ordinary H2O to this kind of fourth phase water. And the  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:37):**  reason we call it fourth phase, because it's just different from ordinary liquid water and certainly  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:43):**  different from solid water, although the structure is somewhat similar to ice, not the same, but  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:49):**  there is some resemblance. And so when the water meets such a surface, what happens is that the  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:12:57):**  water layer, starting with the first layer right next to the surface, undergoes transition from

**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:10):**  interesting, but it turns out many, many, many molecular layers build in that way. We found up  
**[0:13:15-0:13:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:15):**  to millions of molecular layers that can build from such surfaces, all powered by the energy

**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:36):**  this phase are not bouncing around randomly, they're well organized and ordered, in a sense,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:42):**  it's like a crystal, it's a liquid crystal. If you can imagine a crystal of say ice, which is solid  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:50):**  crystal, what happens is as the ice builds, it excludes all kinds of materials and particles from  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:13:56):**  the ice. Otherwise, you wouldn't get a pure crystal of ice, you get ice containing some

**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:14:08):**  they have to push out everything else, they exclude other materials, exactly the same as  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:14:14):**  when the fourth phase builds, it pushes out substances. And that's why we call it exclusion  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:14:20):**  zone because it excludes. There's another reason for calling it exclusion zone, because exclusion

**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:14:49):**  some people still refer to structured water, although that really is not an appropriate term  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:14:54):**  because everything has structure. Ordered water is another, they're all essentially the same term.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:15:00):**  So is that an okay preliminary descriptor of what we're talking about?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:15:06):**  That was an outstanding preliminary descriptor.

**[0:16:48-0:16:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:16:48):**  first and if I run off track, remind me that we also need to address the issue of absorption in  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:16:57):**  plants. So transport, so the question always arises, how does the water get transported?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:04):**  And I guess the question is most interesting when you think of 100 meter tall redwood trees,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:10):**  how does a column of water get transported from the roots all the way up to the leaves on top?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:16):**  And this is a conundrum. In fact, just sitting on my desk right now is a picture of Martin  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:23):**  Fanny. I don't know if you know the name, but Martin, he passed a couple of years ago and  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:28):**  I was sent this memoriam thing and it's been sitting on my desk and he was quite a handsome  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:32):**  guy when he was in his school days. But when I got to know him, he was getting aged and had a lot of  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:38):**  problems and I think he passed probably he was in his 90s and he was highly influential. And he's  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:45):**  the one that had a famous Scientific American article, I think it was called, How Does the  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:49):**  Water Get to the Top of Tall Trees or something like that. And in his review article, he indicated  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:17:54):**  how difficult the problem was to solve, but nobody really could understand because a column like that  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:00):**  is so high that the amount of energy it would take to raise something if you've got a head of water  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:06):**  on top of you that's 300 feet tall, there's a lot of weight and it's hard to imagine getting water  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:13):**  to move up against such a heavy load. And at that time, he was not clear on what he thought,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:20):**  but eventually after many discussions, I think he was kind of aligned with our thinking and he  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:26):**  wrote actually a nice little capsule at the back of my fourth phase book, which is still there.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:33):**  He's had something about, he thought that by reading this book, he would learn how physics  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:38):**  and chemistry apply to water, but he said he learned that through water, he learned more about  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:44):**  how physics and chemistry work. And I was really pleased with that comment. Anyway,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:50):**  the question is how is water transported? And so we think we understand this because we discovered  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:18:58):**  something that was completely unexpected. We found that if we took a tube that could, for example,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:04):**  resemble a xylem tube, if we put the tube made of hydrophilic material, a thin tube, maybe 500  
**[0:19:11-0:19:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:11):**  micrometers in diameter and put it inside a bath of water, this was actually noticed by a young  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:19):**  student working in our laboratory who came running in. I was sitting in my office in the chair where  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:25):**  I'm sitting right now and I had a guest. I can't remember who it was, but we were in the middle of  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:30):**  chatting or something and this undergraduate student walked in and very excited about what  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:35):**  he found. And he was excited enough to interrupt our conversation. And of course, I was happy to  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:42):**  hear what he had to say. He said, you know, I put this tube in the water and the water contained a  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:47):**  lot of particles. So you can, there was any water movement. You could easily track it by looking in  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:52):**  microscope and watching how those particles behave. So he said, I put the tube in the water and I  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:19:59):**  noticed that the water was flowing through the tube, like water flows through a straw and it  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:04):**  doesn't stop. It just keeps going. And he thought it was pretty important. He was supposed to be  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:09):**  doing something else, but like most of the students, they don't listen to me and they  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:12):**  find more interesting stuff than what they were assigned to do. And I actually encourage that sort  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:19):**  of thing because some important discoveries have come. Anyway, he said the water just keeps flowing  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:24):**  through and it just keeps going and it doesn't stop. And he thought this was important. And I  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:28):**  thought it was extremely important because usually if you've got a tube and you want to drive water  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:35):**  through the tube, it's sort of like a blood vessel, you know, and you want to drive blood  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:40):**  through the vessel, you need the heart to do the pumping. Well, we think there's more to it now,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:45):**  but at any rate, you need to develop a pressure or a pressure difference between one end and the  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:52):**  other end. And that pressure gradient drives the flow. And here there's no pressure gradient  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:20:57):**  because the tube is sitting horizontally oriented in the chamber of water. So there's no pressure  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:02):**  difference between one end and the other end. Yet the fluid keeps flowing through and you need  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:08):**  energy to push fluid through. You can't get something for nothing. And so I'm thinking as he  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:13):**  comes in and delivers this news, I'm thinking that if he's right about this, then it's so important  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:19):**  because it demonstrates what we had known up to that point that the energy comes from the light  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:26):**  that's absorbed in the water, especially the infrared light. And so I thought if his  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:32):**  observation is real and we checked it to check for artifacts or errors or stuff, it was correct.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:39):**  If it's correct, it demonstrates the importance of this kind of energy that's being absorbed from  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:46):**  the environment. So of course, when you think about plants, the environment is out there is  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:51):**  pretty important. So we knew, we found out, we did many experiments afterwards that it's the energy  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:21:58):**  from outside, particularly the infrared energy that gets converted into a different kind of  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:03):**  energy. Actually, it's a charge gradient, but we don't need to go into that at the moment. It's in  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:09):**  the fourth phase book, but this is what drives flow through the tube. So now we have something  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:16):**  completely different and understanding about the driving of flow through a tube. And we can  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:23):**  apply that, for example, to what happens in plants and trees, because again, we have these thin tubes  
**[0:22:30-0:22:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:30):**  and in this case, they run vertically. And we know that the energy from outside can be used to  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:39):**  basically push the water through this kind of environment. And Martin Canny, by the way,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:44):**  did an experiment and it appears in my book. He took some xylem and he put some particles inside  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:51):**  and what he saw was an exclusion zone at the edges of the xylem. In other words, this fourth phase  
**[0:22:58-0:23:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:22:58):**  water exists as an annulus just inside the xylem tube. And this is exactly what we found in our  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:07):**  experiments. We used a hydrophilic tube made of various materials and always right next to the  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:13):**  surface, the material surface of the tube just inside is our easy water or exclusion zone. And  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:20):**  so the same thing Martin showed exists in xylem of plants. So therefore this reinforces the idea  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:27):**  that what my students saw in the laboratory may be operative inside the trees and the energy is  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:33):**  now coming from outside. And without going into detail about the mechanism, it has to do with  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:40):**  charges that develop inside the tube and charge gradient. So if you have, for example, a lot of  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:46):**  protons, the protons, well the protons, first of all, attach to water molecules form hydronium  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:51):**  ions and those hydronium ions repel one another. And so if there are fewer hydronium ions up high  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:23:57):**  and more down below, the hydronium ions, which is basically a protonated water, will move upward.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:04):**  And so we're pretty confident that this mechanism is a mechanism that applies in the xylem of plants  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:12):**  and it's detailed. I mean, without a couple of diagrams, it's not so complicated, but it's hard  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:19):**  without diagrams to explain the details of the mechanism, but it's in the fourth phase book.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:26):**  And my point, by the way, is that we think that this occurs also in the cardiovascular system  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:34):**  of you and me. So let me tell you, there's this side issue from the issue of agriculture and  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:39):**  plants, but it's really important. So I began my career studying or simulating, you might say,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:24:46):**  the cardiovascular system, pressure and flow. And I built a model. I was really excited about

**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:05):**  occurred as a consequence of the pumping of the heart. And so for many years, I was kind of proud  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:11):**  of that, although it made no impact. I began to understand why. Usually when people build models,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:17):**  the models are filled with assumptions. And if you're not sure about whether these assumptions  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:23):**  are accurate or true or not, then it blends a kind of doubt. But at any rate, I thought I really understood  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:29):**  the cardiovascular system until I went on one of my trips to Russia, to Moscow University, where my  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:36):**  good friend Vladimir Vayikov introduced me to his neighbor, the guy in the next laboratory.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:43):**  And this guy was studying the cardiovascular system and he tells me through translation,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:48):**  in the cardiovascular system, there's a very big problem. Oh, really? Tell me about it. He said,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:25:54):**  well, the big problem is that capillaries are so small. So you start with the arteries and  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:01):**  arterioles down to very thin capillaries and then the venules and the veins and back to the heart.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:08):**  And it circulates. But when you get to those tiny capillaries, there's a problem because in healthy  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:15):**  young adults, the diameter of the capillary is three or four micrometers. And you compare three  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:21):**  or four with the red blood cell that needs to squeeze through and it's six or seven micrometers.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:27):**  So it looks like a plumbing problem. It looks like you have to force those red blood cells somehow to  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:34):**  get through these narrow conduits. And it looks like a screw up of mother nature. How is it possible?  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:40):**  This is not a plumbing system that you would think that mother nature would devise, but  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:44):**  that's the way it is. And of course, there are reasons for it, obviously. But one of the things  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:49):**  is that in order to squeeze those red blood cells through, they have to bend, have to be kind of  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:26:54):**  squeezed and pushed through. So this Russian guy calculates the amount of resistance that would be  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:00):**  encountered in squeezing these red blood cells and pushing them through. And he comes to the conclusion  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:05):**  that the resistance is so high that if the heart were fully responsible for driving blood through  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:12):**  those capillaries, the heart would need to develop an extraordinarily high pressure, something like a  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:18):**  million times the pressure that it actually develops. You might call that high blood pressure,  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:24):**  but we're talking about six orders of magnitude. So this is a problem. He says it can't be. There  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:31):**  must be something else besides the heart that's doing this because it just can't be. It's just  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:37):**  too far off. And well, that had big influence. The first thing, he had a few ideas about  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:45):**  mechanisms. I had my own ideas and I knew about our work where if you put a tube in a chamber of  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:52):**  water, flow goes through the tube, like through a straw. So I'm thinking, wow, the same phenomenon  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:27:59):**  could be at play in blood vessels. And we tested it and my student has just been working on his  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:06):**  writing his PhD dissertation on this. And we found indeed that that was the case. We found that first  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:12):**  of all, like others who found, if you stop the heart, the flow doesn't cease. This is the first  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:18):**  thing that is shocking. Many people don't know about this, but there are a handful of studies  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:23):**  over the years that have shown that, that if you stop the heart in any of a number of ways,  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:30):**  you don't stop the flow. It goes down quite a lot, but it keeps going. And so the question is, well,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:36):**  how is it possible that it can keep going? There must be something that is at work in addition to  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:42):**  the heart. And I think what's at work is the mechanism that I've been talking about where  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:46):**  you can get flow propelled by the energy, electromagnetic energy, I guess you'd call it  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:53):**  infrared light energy. And you know, inside our body, there's lots of infrared because  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:28:58):**  the metabolic energy is heat and heat is where you get infrared energy. So it's like a sauna going  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:05):**  into the sauna. You get lots of infrared energy and that energy is absorbed by the body. So at any  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:12):**  rate, we found that if you add infrared energy, that this flow through the capillaries that's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:18):**  retained, even when the heart is not beating, it amplifies enormously. So we're confident that the  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:24):**  phenomenon that I mentioned to you, where you get flow in a tube that it applies not only in our  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:32):**  cardiovascular system, but also in the vessels of plants and trees. So that was a long answer to your,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:40):**  I guess it was your second question about flow.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:44):**  Jerry, I'd love to follow up on this. I know that you expressly mentioned that it's difficult  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:50):**  to describe with a diagram. And so if this question isn't easy to answer, then we can  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:29:55):**  come back to it in some other fashion. But we know within your blood example, we know that  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:01):**  having the right electrolyte balance within blood is very important. Sodium, potassium, for example.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:06):**  And you mentioned the importance of having the appropriate proton pressure and proton gradients  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:12):**  and within plants. And so I'm wondering how does this awareness also transfer to our understanding  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:20):**  of nutrient mobility within the vascular tissue of a plant? Are there important nutrient balances  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:26):**  that we should be paying attention to in plant structure as well? Well, there are, but I don't  
**[0:30:30-0:30:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:30):**  know them. And so I would hesitate to speculate, but I will say one thing that if you want to  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:38):**  transfer something through tissue or through a vessel, there is a way to do this. I hesitate to  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:46):**  come across as though I tried to sell my book, but in the first book, Sales, Gels and the  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:30:53):**  Hengins of Life, this is described in detail. What it involves is if you can imagine a tube  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:01):**  filled with easy water, with structured water, and that tube tends to exclude everything,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:07):**  almost everything. We can't say everything because we haven't studied everything.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:10):**  However, if there's a region along the tube that is not the ordered or easy water,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:17):**  but it's ordinary water, the solutes or nutrients or whatever you like will tend to gather in that  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:25):**  zone. There is a process that I described called zone melting, which pretty much does exactly this.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:31):**  So again, along the tube, inside the tube, you've got structured water, but in some region along  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:38):**  that structured water, you have a zone that's not structured. And so all of the nutrients would be  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:45):**  there. Now, if this non-structured zone propagates along the inside of the tube, then the nutrients  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:51):**  will move with it. And this is a way of transporting substances. And I think that this  
**[0:31:59-0:32:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:31:59):**  may operate inside the cell. If the cell, you think of the cell as containing only structured  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:07):**  water, and I think there's fair evidence that most of the water inside the cell contains easy water,  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:14):**  then all the nutrients would seem to get excluded. That won't work. And so you need to have regions  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:21):**  inside the cell that are non-structured, at least transiently non-structured. And then you can move  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:26):**  things from outside to inside or inside to outside. And I think this is the way nature does it.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:34):**  The word that comes to mind is like caterpillar or something where you have something propagating  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:40):**  along it. And this is one way that nature can move substances. And I think it occurs not only  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:49):**  in plant cells, but also in animal cells. And I give some examples in that  
**[0:32:54-0:33:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:32:54):**  Dales, Jails and the Engine of Life book, which I, sorry, the book was published some years ago  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:33:02):**  and a few things have changed. Mostly, I think the book is as accurate as it was then. I think  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:33:08):**  it's as accurate now with the exception of a few considerations that are slightly different based  
**[0:33:13-0:33:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:33:13):**  on what we found since then. But I think this is how nutrients can move from one place to another  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:33:21):**  place. I hope that's clear. I'm not sure it is. Yes, I understand what you're trying to communicate

**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:33:59):**  where the evidence doesn't fit the theory. And the classical one that I refer to all the time is  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:04):**  the absorption of systemic insecticides by plant roots where we're applying systemic compounds that

**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:15):**  You've proposed that there might be some alternate mechanisms for nutrient absorption by cells. Can

**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:29):**  mentioned that the membrane is impermeable and that pumps and channels are what governs pretty  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:37):**  much the behavior of cells, what comes in, what goes out. And I think that concept is just dead  
**[0:34:42-0:34:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:42):**  wrong. And I know I'm in the minority and let me explain. First of all, most cells, not all cells,  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:34:54):**  have negative charge inside them, net negative charge. And if you stick an electrode inside the  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:00):**  cell and measure the electrical potential difference between the inside and the outside,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:05):**  typically in animal cells, it'll be minus 50 to minus 100 millivolts and in plant cells,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:11):**  it's higher, typically, maybe 100 to 200 millivolts negative. But at any rate, the inside of the cell  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:17):**  is negative. And this is reported by many people for many years. And I think there's no question  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:22):**  about it. The only question is, how does it occur? What's the reason for it? And somebody came up  
**[0:35:28-0:35:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:28):**  many years ago, got a Nobel Prize for suggesting a sodium pump. That is, this pump lies in the  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:38):**  membrane and the sodium gets pumped out. And so if you're pumping out positive charges,  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:43):**  a simplification of what the theory is, but basically if you pump out positive charge,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:49):**  then the cell remains negative instead of neutral and the pump keeps going and therefore the cell  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:35:56):**  remains negative. So it's an active dynamic kind of thing. A different explanation is that the easy  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:02):**  water inside the cell is negatively charged. And this is the reason why the inside of the cell has  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:08):**  negative charge. Now I'm not the only one nor the first one to question the existence of pumps and  
**[0:36:15-0:36:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:15):**  channels. Gilbert Ling, who I mentioned earlier, Gilbert came from China after World War II and  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:23):**  he was among three people chosen from all over China to come to the US study. And there were  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:31):**  three and one of them, I think one passed and one of them got a Nobel Prize in physics. And then  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:37):**  it was Gilbert Ling who many people suggested is deserving of at least one Nobel Prize and maybe  
**[0:36:43-0:36:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:43):**  more, but he's been passed over at least so far. And so Gilbert did some experiments to check this  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:50):**  idea that the membrane contained pumps and what he did was poison the cell in many different ways.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:36:57):**  I mean, it was, you might say overkill. And so if you pull the plug, if you poison, metabolically  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:05):**  poison the cell, you're basically pulling the plug on the pump and therefore the effect of  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:11):**  pumping should disappear right away. But they didn't. He could measure what's been attributed  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:17):**  to pumping. That is the electrical potential was maintained for many, many hours after that  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:23):**  and finally disappeared and he computed. And with the most generous of assumptions given to the  
**[0:37:27-0:37:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:27):**  other side, the cell needed 30 times the amount of energy that it could possibly conceivably muster  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:35):**  just to achieve that. And so he said, it doesn't work. The evidence doesn't fit. Well,  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:40):**  nobody has challenged that since then. And Gilbert raised a number of other considerations,  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:46):**  which have gotten increasingly significant because the number of pumps that are now attributed to,  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:37:55):**  I mean, suggested to lie in the membrane is something, a student who's studying this told me  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:01):**  something like 2,500 or something like this and the number keeps increasing because, you know,  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:07):**  in order to explain this separation of various ions or other substances, the trend is to suggest  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:13):**  a pump. So everything's got their own pump and typically their own channel as well. And so  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:18):**  Gilbert says, there's not enough room in the membrane to accommodate all of these pumps,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:24):**  let alone enough energy to power them because the sodium pump itself, even under the best of  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:29):**  conditions, he computed uses 30 or 40% of all the energy that the cell can muster. At that time,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:36):**  the thought was there's only one pump and that's the sodium pump. So if you think of that pump  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:42):**  is using 30, 40% of the cell's energy, and by now we're talking about thousands of pumps,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:48):**  it just doesn't make sense. And so that, for me, Gilbert's evidence suggests that there's no such  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:38:55):**  thing as a pump, doesn't exist in the membrane. As for the channels, there are other arguments and  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:02):**  these are brought up in the cells, gels and the engine of life book. If you think now there are  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:09):**  more than a thousand, I believe different channels for different substances, different ions and such,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:15):**  and there are big ones, smaller, smaller, smaller down to very small, even so-called aquaporin  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:23):**  channels for water. And if you imagine the lineup of all of these channels in the membrane,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:29):**  one for the biggest substance, the next biggest, the next biggest, so on, in order, the logic is  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:35):**  that each one will allow only one particular substance to flow through and exclude all the  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:43):**  others. So imagine, let's take first the biggest substance like a basketball and imagine a channel  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:50):**  that will let the basketball through. So when the channel opens and lets the basketball through,  
**[0:39:56-0:40:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:39:56):**  that channel must be able to exclude the softball, volleyball, golf ball, and all the others,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:04):**  right? But they're all smaller. So how is it possible that that channel for the basketball,  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:11):**  when it opens, can exclude all the smaller ones? You think that all the smaller ones would  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:14):**  fail right through. That applies not only to the channel for the biggest one, but the second  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:20):**  biggest also has to exclude all of the smaller ones and so on and so forth. So logically,  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:27):**  it becomes untenable because it's hard to think of a mechanism where a certain channel will  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:33):**  certainly pass its basketball through, but how is it going to exclude all the smaller ones?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:39):**  It's kind of like having a dog door, and the dog can get through barely,  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:44):**  they squeeze through to get in or out of your house, but cat can go through too,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:48):**  and so can the mouse or whatever. It doesn't exclude all the others. So there's a logical  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:40:54):**  inconsistency in the idea of channels. So both the idea of channels and pumps,  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:00):**  there's something wrong with those concepts. So we go back to the issue of how does the cell get  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:05):**  its electrical potential? As I'm suggesting, it's the water that's inside the cell that's negatively  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:11):**  charged that accounts for this. So the idea has been that the cell membrane is impermeable to  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:18):**  everything, and the only way that things get in and out are through these channels. But if the  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:22):**  channel doesn't exist, then what's going on? I think the answer is that cell membrane is not  
**[0:41:28-0:41:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:28):**  impermeable to substances. There's several pieces of evidence. The one that I like is if you take a  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:35):**  cell and you pass an electric current, this is the technique called electroporation, where once you  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:41):**  pass the electric current, the holes in the membrane are large enough that genomic material  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:48):**  can pass through. So we're talking about really big molecules can pass through, and the evidence  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:41:53):**  for that is if you take a new genetic information and put it outside the cell, it gets incorporated,

**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:42:52):**  is it's a gel, and you know if you handle a gel, the gel hangs together, it doesn't need a membrane,

**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:43:11):**  impermeable to all of this stuff is questionable. Another experiment to support that is if you take

**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:51:28):**  what the implications might be. Today there is, we have a water crisis in agriculture and what I mean  
**[0:51:35-0:51:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:51:35):**  by that is we have soils that do not hold water very well. They've lost their aggregate structure,  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:51:41):**  crumb structure and so water doesn't infiltrate into the soils very well anymore and soils have

**[0:52:34-0:52:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:52:34):**  the first point is that easy water is the main water that fills biological systems for the most  
**[0:52:41-0:52:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:52:41):**  part and but easy water grows next to hydrophilic surfaces, not all hydrophilic surfaces but  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:52:49):**  many of them. So the surface of the soil or what's in the soil needs to be appropriate  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:52:56):**  and if it's not appropriate then the water that goes in won't stick or won't hydrate.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:03):**  So if the soil is well, if the water holding capacity, what you mentioned water holding  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:11):**  capacity has to do with the surface of what's in the soil and if it's appropriate or natural,  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:18):**  I would say, then it holds plenty of water and if you put water either through rainfall or  
**[0:53:24-0:53:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:24):**  irrigation or however, the soil would hold that water properly but if you change the soil in ways  
**[0:53:32-0:53:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:32):**  that don't let the soil material hold that water then the soil won't be hydrated the way  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:40):**  we expect it to be and the water would just pass through or run down the slope or what have you.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:45):**  So this is the issue that the content of the soil, the surfaces of what the soil contains  
**[0:53:54-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:53:54):**  need to be the kinds of hydrophilic materials that hold the water and that water is easy water,  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:02):**  they need to be the kinds of surfaces that actually build easy water and then if so,  
**[0:54:07-0:54:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:07):**  if the surfaces are right then the easy water will build on them. We studied many kinds of surfaces  
**[0:54:13-0:54:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:13):**  and if you add water, some surfaces are really great about building easy water and that's the  
**[0:54:19-0:54:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:19):**  water that is in biology, the water that's needed and other surfaces are not so great. So it has  
**[0:54:24-0:54:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:24):**  something to do with the molecular nature of the particular surface and one hypothesis or  
**[0:54:31-0:54:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:31):**  speculation is that the charges on the surface need to be alternating in some way and distributed  
**[0:54:38-0:54:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:38):**  in such a way as to form a template for the buildup of easy water and if they're not,

**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:52):**  you think of proteins and nucleic acids and such inside the cell. In terms of the soil,  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:54:59):**  the same principles should apply that the material in the soil should be such that their surfaces of  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:55:05):**  this material have charge distributions that are just right to build easy water. If not,

**[0:56:22-0:56:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:56:22):**  I think a lot of people are quite aware of this. Jerry, what is the question you wish I would have asked?

**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:56:40):**  I guess I had wished that you might ask me about the role of water in health, in our health,

**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:56:59):**  Well, from our point of view, what we've learned, water is absolutely central for health. It's not

**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:57:32):**  the index because it's so secondary. The first chapter will always talk about water and  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:57:37):**  its properties, and then the rest of the chapter will go on to fail to mention water at all.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:57:42):**  But water is so central. I think the reason it's central is that every protein in our body,  
**[0:57:50-0:57:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:57:50):**  and of course when the proteins fold, that does the work of the cell. So like in a muscle cell,  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:57:58):**  the myosin and actin proteins fold in some way and that gives us contraction. Then they unfold  
**[0:58:04-0:58:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:58:04):**  and we get back to the relaxed state, but they're all surrounded by water. Although biologists often  
**[0:58:11-0:58:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:58:11):**  forget that these molecules are bathed in water and the kind of water they're bathed in is easy

**[0:58:29-0:58:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:58:29):**  water and the protein are really a single unit together. They're one and the same. You can't  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:58:34):**  separate them. So if the cell is missing this kind of easy water or it's deficient in it, or you  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:58:41):**  might say it's dehydrated, it can't function properly. If you're dehydrated, you can't play

**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:00):**  need a lot of, you need a full amount of easy water in your cell for that cell to function

**[0:59:24-0:59:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:24):**  simple things that you can do. And one of them I mentioned is the sauna or sauna, depending on if  
**[0:59:32-0:59:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:32):**  you're from Finland or not. And it's hot, always hot. It's going to be dry or humid, but it's always

**[0:59:43-0:59:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:43):**  absorbing a whole lot of infrared energy. And this infrared energy is what builds easy water.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:49):**  So the reason I think, or one reason you feel good, re-energize after you sit in the sauna is  
**[0:59:56-1:00:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=0:59:56):**  that you're absorbing so much infrared energy that it builds easy water inside your cells. And  
**[1:00:03-1:00:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:03):**  especially in those cells that have been deficient in easy water, they come up to their usual

**[1:00:15-1:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:15):**  refreshed, or your muscles don't ache anymore, et cetera, et cetera. And so this is one easy thing,  
**[1:00:22-1:00:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:22):**  so-called easy thing for you to do to improve your health. Another one is what plants do naturally,  
**[1:00:31-1:00:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:31):**  and that is earthing or grounding themselves because they're in the ground. And question,  
**[1:00:36-1:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:36):**  and there are a lot of biophysical and health studies now that show that if you ground yourself  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:42):**  or earth yourself by either walking barefoot in the sand or on the grass or immerse yourself in

**[1:00:55-1:01:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:00:55):**  out, although I didn't know this myself until about a decade ago, that the earth has a net  
**[1:01:02-1:01:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:02):**  negative charge. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I grew up as a student in electrical  
**[1:01:09-1:01:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:09):**  engineering. And if one of my professors had told me that the earth has a negative charge,  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:15):**  if you plug in into the wall that you've got three prongs and one is the ground, if that connects to  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:20):**  a vast ocean of negative charge, I would have said, you're crazy. Because it didn't make any  
**[1:01:25-1:01:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:25):**  sense. But when this was first presented to me by a Russian guy who declared that my education was  
**[1:01:32-1:01:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:32):**  deficient because in Russia, every middle school student knows about this, but in the US, almost  
**[1:01:38-1:01:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:38):**  nobody knows about it. It's not that it's controversial, it's just that it's not taught.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:42):**  The earth is full of negative charge. Well, negative charge is needed to convert water to  
**[1:01:48-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:48):**  easy water. So if you connect yourself, if you so-called earth yourself by walking barefoot or  
**[1:01:54-1:02:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:01:54):**  walking on beach barefoot, you're connecting yourself electrically to this vast sea of  
**[1:02:02-1:02:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:02):**  negativity. I hate to use that word because it sounds like a psychological term, but negative  
**[1:02:08-1:02:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:08):**  charge. I guess Benjamin Franklin screwed up when he called electrons negative, I should have said  
**[1:02:15-1:02:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:15):**  positive, but whatever. If you're connecting yourself to this sea of electrons, then these  
**[1:02:23-1:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:23):**  electrons can come and be absorbed in your body to build easy water. And so this is another way,  
**[1:02:30-1:02:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:30):**  at least I think this is the most straightforward explanation of why you feel better when you ground  
**[1:02:36-1:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:36):**  yourself because you're absorbing this charge, build easy water and yourself can now function  
**[1:02:41-1:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:41):**  better. So that's another way. And a third way that you can help yourself is by doing what you  
**[1:02:49-1:02:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:49):**  plant people know very well, and that is juicing, green juicing. Take a freshly growing plant  
**[1:02:56-1:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:02:56):**  and squeeze it, squeeze the juice out of it and what you're doing and drink it. And what you're  
**[1:03:00-1:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:00):**  doing is squeezing the juice from inside the plant cell and the water from inside the plant cell  
**[1:03:08-1:03:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:08):**  should be filled with easy water. So you're effectively drinking easy water, which should  
**[1:03:13-1:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:13):**  very nicely rehydrate yourself. And as I said, the hydration is so important for function and  
**[1:03:20-1:03:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:20):**  health. So those are three, there are a few more ways, but I think we're running out of time.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:29):**  But there are simple ways that you can make yourself healthy.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:33):**  You connected another dot for me, which is something that just popped into my mind. When  
**[1:03:39-1:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:39):**  you mentioned infrared, today of course, many growers are starting to do field measurements  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:44):**  with drones, with various cameras using various or capturing various wavelengths. And there's been

**[1:03:58-1:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:03:58):**  have high levels of organic matter and very strong bacterial and fungal populations,  
**[1:04:02-1:04:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:02):**  have an extremely strong infrared signature, several orders of magnitude.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:06):**  I'm not sure what you mean by signature. Do you mean that they're emitting infrared or absorbing?  
**[1:04:12-1:04:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:12):**  Yes, correct. They are emitting infrared.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:15):**  I see. Okay. Well, more so than other comparable soils that are less organic.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:24):**  Yes, substantially more so.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:26):**  Okay. Well, that's pretty interesting. When you build easy water, there are lots of charges that  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:34):**  are moving around from one point to another. And it's basically charged movement that gives rise  
**[1:04:39-1:04:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:39):**  to electromagnetic radiation, especially in the infrared region. So this could be an indication of  
**[1:04:47-1:04:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:47):**  charges moving around to build easy water. It's not the necessary condition, but that would be  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:53):**  one interpretation of what's going on. So that would fit very nicely. Hadn't been aware of that.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/rethinking-plant-physiology-and-absorption-of-nutrients-from-the-soil-with-gerald-pollack/#t=1:04:58):**  That's interesting information.

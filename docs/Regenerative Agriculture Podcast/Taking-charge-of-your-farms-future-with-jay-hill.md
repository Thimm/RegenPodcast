**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, friends. This is John. Welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast, where we talk  
**[0:00:05-0:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  about agronomic science and cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, that  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:10):**  regenerate soil health, and ultimately that regenerate public health. My guest for this  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:15):**  episode is Jay Hill, who farms in the American Southwest, has a significant following on social  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  media, also hosts his own podcast. And I'm sure many of you have heard of him. And for those of  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  you who haven't, you deserve to hear about him, which is why we have him on. So welcome, Jay.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  Thanks for being here. I'd love to hear a bit more about your story and background. Tell us  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:34):**  about what you're doing and how you got to this point. John, thanks for having me on the podcast.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  Yeah, so my world into agriculture has been what I would consider non-conventional. I didn't grow  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  up in a large family that farmed. I did grow up in a large family. I'm the youngest of five  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  and grew up in Southern New Mexico in the Mesilla Valley. My parents had 10 acres. My father was a  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  sales rep for an education company that did technical school education. So HVAC,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  diesel automotive repair. My mom worked as a secretary as well as she quit that and was a  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:10):**  stay-at-home mom as I grew up and took care of the five of us. And I grew up in a tractor tire  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:16):**  sandbox behind my parents' house. Got to watch the world of agriculture just kind of go by and knew I  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  wanted to do something in that. Talk about a wild ride. At the age of 15, I went to my dad and said,  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  hey, I'm really interested in doing something on the farm. And he said, well, what do you want to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:33):**  do? I said, I think I want to be an onion farmer. I think I want to get into growing something that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  we can actually have a sustainable farm with. And so he said, come up with a business plan.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  We linked forces with a family that grows packs and ships onions. Wild turn of events. First year  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  of growing onions, we hit a good market. I was able to lease the farm next door at the age of 17  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  and then have just kind of been on a tear since then. We've now since joined forces with my  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  business partner, Danny Hedediah in Del City, Texas. We cultivate about 13,000 acres all  
**[0:02:09-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:09):**  irrigated. We are a conventional farm. We've done a little bit of organic a couple of years ago,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  just trying to dip our toes into it, but it was a half-hearted attempt at what we wanted to do.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:22):**  A lot of differences between the two growing regions still have our farm in Las Cruces.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:27):**  It's irrigated through the Rio Grande River and the aquifer there. Sweet water is what we call  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:32):**  it. It's good water. It's a clay-based soil. Whereas in Del City, a lot of salt, a lot of  
**[0:02:40-0:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  calcium. We irrigate with pivot drip and flood. And in our bread and butter is alfalfa. Animal  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:48):**  feed is kind of what we specialized in. We own a company called Chaffey, which is a cultured feed  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  that we sell all over the country into Japan, Puerto Rico, and starting into Columbia now.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  We do wine grapes, chili peppers, onions, cabbage, lettuce, pecans, cotton, wheat, barley, oats,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  sorghum, some teff. We're just trying now. It sounds funny, but as we've built this farm,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  my intent was not to ever get this big. I wanted to be a large-scale agriculturalist at some  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:22):**  point, but I didn't understand how fast that would happen and how slow that would happen. So this is  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  my 20th season. This is my 20th crop that I've been able to plant. It's just been a wild ride.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  We are now facing not only drought challenges. I've farmed for 20 years and every year has been  
**[0:03:41-0:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  a drought year. I've never had a wet year. So with our change in climate, the adaption to new  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:49):**  technologies is there. But then two, I really want to make sure that whatever we're growing on our  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  farm is marketable. I want to make sure that people that are buying our farm are getting  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  the same results. I want to make sure that people that are buying our feed or buying our produce or  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  buying the lint from our cotton, I want them to have a sense of connection with who I am,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  who our company is, and that we're making decisions based on what is best for the people  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  that are the end consumer or the animal that's the end consumer. There's a lot of farmers that  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  say that. Now it's time for us to prove that we cannot farm the way that generations have farmed  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  in the natural resources. We want to make a better impact on our economy, on our soil, on our  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  presence here. And so that's leading us down this natural approach. We were the first farm out here  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  to start cover cropping. And not that cover cropping is just a complete game changer,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  even though it has been. We're just starting to look at ways that we can put nutrient organically  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  back into the soil, or at least solidifying our soil structure out here. And I've been blessed  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:00):**  with an unbelievable team of men and women, some of which are agronomists, some of which  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  don't come from agriculture, but they're willing to think outside of the box and solve this problem  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  that we're having. Financially is not the issue. The issue is longevity and being able to make sure  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  that we're making a play that when I'm dead and gone, that somebody can come onto this farm and  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  say, man, this is the best soil in the desert Southwest that we've seen. And so that's,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  that's where we're at today. We're running down that mission right now.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:34):**  When you consider developing your operation at the scale that it is right now, with the types  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:40):**  of crops that you are growing, you express the need to develop an operation that is perhaps not  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:46):**  as resource exhaustive. How do you see your operation evolving in the future? What are the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:51):**  changes? How would you like to see your operation improve in the future?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  Well, I think that the first thing that we see out here with our climate is we want to make sure that  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  that we're utilizing water. We've got lots of neighbors over the mountain that's in the Oglala  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  aquifer, and we're hearing all these stories of wells going dry and tying eight and 10 wells  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  together to make one circle. And they're still doing the same practices that their grandfather  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  did. And for us to be able to be viable and not lose that resource of water, we are going,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  right now, our mission is to, how do we get the most crop, the biggest crop we can for each drop  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  of water that we apply to the soil? And so what does the biomass look like? What does the micro  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:34):**  colony look like inside of that soil structure to retain the water a little bit longer?  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  And so crop rotation has been very key. I'm not a cotton farmer by trade. We started growing cotton  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  three years ago just for a rotation purpose. It's not really doing anything for the soil,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:50):**  but we looked at it because of the fact that it was genetically modified, that we would be able to  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  clean up weed problems and pressures that we have in these fields.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  But now we're starting to see what the right style of cover cropping, our wheat pressure is  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  going away. And if we can map that ground a certain way, then we're not having to go in and  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  apply a herbicide. A lot of people ask, well, are you trying to transition to organics?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:21):**  And the answer to that is if I can viably move myself into a growing system that does not rely  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  on something that is synthetic or man-made or nature can take care of itself, that is  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  something that I'm interested in and willing to take a chance on getting myself into.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  And so that's kind of where we're at right now. When we look at agriculture, one of the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  challenges that growers have in considering different types or adopting different types  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  of growing practices, incorporating cover crops and so forth, for example, and shifting to a more  
**[0:07:56-0:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  regenerative farming style, one of the significant barriers to change is that farming is considered  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:05):**  to be a very, very high risk endeavor. And with very limited margins, growers historically have  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  been price takers rather than price makers for most crops, certainly for all the commodity crops.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  It's my understanding that this is something that you have personally sought to change on your  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  operation. How do farmers need to think about pricing the products that they are growing and  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  positioning themselves differently? We positioned ourselves as farmers, not as marketers.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  Or not as businessmen or business women. There's this big riff in agriculture between an organic  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  producer and a conventional producer. And the conventional producer is saying, hey, why in the  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  world are people putting all these labels on things that I'm selling? And they're fear-mongering  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  and marketing and doing all those kinds of things. In all reality, that industry has figured out a  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:08:56):**  way to market itself through transparency and through other options that have made them more  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  viable. Therefore, they're able to demand a price for something that they're producing.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  And that's not overall. I mean, there's a fear I have in organics is the fact that people are going  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  to get to a point where, yes, they're seeing a higher profit margin, but at the same time,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:17):**  they're still not allowing themselves to set the market for what they're doing. And I don't want  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:22):**  to get myself into that. The one thing that has been a struggle for me is finding out how do I  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  get rid of the person that is telling me what he's willing to pay? And how do I get in front of the  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  person that I'm going to be able to say, this is what I have, and this is what it's going to cost  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:38):**  for you to do that. And so now I am linking myself with industry. We're going to be making our own  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:45):**  shirts and our own pants in the near future. We are just like the Chaffee. Yes, we still service  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  large feedlots and dairies, and we want to continue to do so. But at the same time, we  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  control our destiny with that. We can tell them what we want to be paid, and if they say no, then  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:03):**  we have to go back to the negotiating table. But that's a lot better spot to be in than saying,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  you know, just pay me whatever you want to pay me for what I'm growing. I don't want to get myself  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  stuck in that system. And I did that in the vegetable system. I just got to a point where  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  you could give you a piece of paper with a pencil mark saying what they were paying you for it,  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:22):**  and you're like, oh, thank you so much. I would rather go out and find the bright minds  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  to market our own stuff and let people be able to interact directly with who I am and who my  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:33):**  company is and say, we want to support you because you're doing the right thing.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  And so we've been doing that over the last couple of years, and it's a struggle. But as a farmer  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:44):**  that grows a commodity style crop, you've got to be able to take control of your own destiny by not  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  only marketing what you're doing, but being able to have something that's got demand. I mean, if I  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:10:55):**  sit here, obviously for us, the easiest crop we can grow is cotton. And if I was going to sit here  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  and to say, I'm going to be a cotton farmer, I'm going to put my cotton just into the open market.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  And when somebody decides to pay me for it, that'll be great. I would lose 90% of the employment that  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:15):**  I have on this farm right now. Our diversity is something that gives us power and gives us  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:20):**  employment. And our team links behind us and saying, yes, we believe in the fact that we want  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  to stand behind whatever products we're growing. And so it is a very difficult conversation to  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  have with yourself. It'll drive a normal man to drinking, I think, but at the same time for us,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:37):**  it's just been one of those things that if we can't control it, then we really don't want to  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  grow it. And we're still, we're not there 100% yet. I mean, we're still price takers with a lot  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  of commodities that we grow. But my plan in the next five years is that we will have say so in  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  what our future holds. What have you done so far? You mentioned that you're developing your own  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  jeans and your own t-shirts as a pathway to sell your cotton, but what have you done up to this  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  point to move from being price takers to price makers on some few items? So one of the things  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  that we're doing is we're differentiating ourselves in the market. We might be growing the  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:15):**  same crops the neighbor grows, but we're working with the marketing. We have a full marketing  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:20):**  team. We have eight people on our marketing team now that are just showing what we do and how we  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  do it. Just letting people know that if we're growing alfalfa and you want to feed your horse  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  your horse alfalfa, these are the growing practices that we do. This is the guarantee  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:38):**  that we give you. And we're going to stand behind our product. We're going to have all  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  of the certifications and labels that we're allowed to put onto that product. And we're  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  going to give it to them. Jaffe company is one of those companies that is allowing us to say,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  this is what we have. This is what it's worth. And this is what you get if you buy something from us.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  Just like in Chile, I've linked up with on our human consumptive chili that we're growing,  
**[0:13:03-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:03):**  we've linked up with a salsa company. And that salsa company has interest in what we're doing  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  as well as if they're profitable, then we're able to share in some of that profit.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:17):**  With the efforts that you've made so far with Jaffe and with the salsa company, obviously  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  you're investing in the marketing and there is a significant investment cost there. What  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  has the reward spent? How has the pricing change for the alfalfa that you're selling versus  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  the price that you would just be able to get on the open market? I'm not necessarily going to  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:37):**  equate it to more revenue. I'm going to equate it to sustainable revenue. We're not seeing  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:44):**  by adding marketing and we're 2021 we're entering an agreement where we're growing onions specifically  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  for a company that they are going to retain ownership of that, that we are just going to be  
**[0:13:57-0:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  the grower. And those kinds of things don't necessarily, what if the market's $60 a bag next  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:05):**  year? Well, we're not going to be able to participate in that. But at the same time, we know  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  that we've got hard costs and hard numbers that are going to come back that are going to pay  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:14):**  dividends into what we're doing. And so you don't necessarily make more money by selling your own  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:20):**  thing. But you make sustainable money, which is you know how much product you have, you know what  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  it's worth, and you know that you can sell that in times when the market is good or bad. And that's  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  what we're looking for. They talked about the curve with the coronavirus and how you flatten  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  the curve. We want to flatten our market where it's not next year I'm going to my dairyman and  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  I'm saying alfalfa is going to be $300 a ton. And they're saying, well, milk is only $14 a hundred.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  Well, there's no way we can pay for that. We want to be able to come back to them and say,  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  you know what, the market's showing $300 a ton. We're going to be able to come in at $250 a ton.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  And next year when the market drops out of sight because people gouged you, we're still going to  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  be here and we're going to get a little bit more. And we've been doing that for the last four years  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  with alfalfa. And we were at the top of the market this year. We got paid more than anybody else.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:14):**  But not one time did one of our bigger buyers say, hey, this is not a deal that's working  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  because they understand that if this market flips and goes the other way, we're still going to be  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  there with them. I find it interesting that in the examples you provided of working with cotton  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  and with the salsa, with the chili peppers, both of the steps that you described include processing.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  How important do you believe is it in looking across diversity of different crops for growers  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  to make the connections to processing and going directly to the consumer rather than  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  just selling the original crop right out of the field? With my mindset, it's a no-brainer.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  If I can't control the processing end of it or at least have a part of the processing end of it,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  then I don't want to be associated with that company because it doesn't give me a lot of  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  clarity. They can say, hey, we just did a retooling at the plant and we're going to have  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:13):**  to take another 25 cents off the top because we retooled. And I have no say-so in that matter.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  Most farmers are at this point where you have to make a decision. Are you a tractor driver or are  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  you a business owner? And I tell the guys and the guys give me a hard time if they see me on a  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:29):**  tractor, which this afternoon I'm going to get on a tractor just for mental clarity. But if I'm on a  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  tractor, I'm not making money. My job as a farmer is to be able to grow the best crop that we can  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  grow and be able to process and market that in a way that all of those streams that we have to go

**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:52):**  in a large trucking company. We want to be able to control our final destiny, vertical integration.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:16:59):**  Within all of this context, we've been speaking about processing and price making. I'd like to  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  get back, I guess I'll just leave it open for you to answer this question in any way that you would  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  like. What do you believe to be true about agriculture that is different from the mainstream  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:14):**  view of many others in the ag community? I think one of the big perceptions is that farmers are  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  welfare dependent and that we have lost the ability to be creative and be sustainable. I hate  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  the word sustainability. You know, everybody's talking about, well, this farm is so sustainable  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:33):**  this farm is regenerative or this farm is that or this. The people that are in agriculture that are  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:40):**  going through 2020 like it's a normal year, the people that are going to be able to come out on  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  the other side and smile about everything that's been going on are the people that have dedicated  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  themselves to being a business type person. The perception that I should be in overalls and have  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  a piece of straw hanging out of my mouth. And I know I've got nicotine in my lip, but that's just  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  a bad habit. But the perception that somebody sees of me, I want to be able to walk into a ballroom  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  and sit down and have a conversation about nuclear energy. And somebody later that night go home and  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  be like, I just found Jay on Instagram. Turns out he's a farmer. I had no idea that farmers could  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  actually think or talk about something other than just we're all going broke and we're all dying.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:28):**  And so that perception that we're just a bunch of hillbillies that don't really understand what's  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  going on in the world is not true because there's some of the most innovative people I've ever met  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  in my life are farmers or ranchers. I would say that many of the farmers that I speak with  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  are amongst the smartest people that I know. And the way that you answered the question that I just  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  asked or approached this from a perspective of taking responsibility, what have we done  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  collectively as an agricultural industry? What behaviors have we engaged in that have created  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:04):**  that perception? Yeah. So we've done a really awful job, in my opinion, of showing the innovation  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  that we truly have. And I'm not talking about equipment companies showing what we're doing,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  but actually engaging with the people that are buying the products that we're producing. A lot  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:25):**  of these big farm networks and farm bureaus and things like that are like, hey, we've got to tell  
**[0:19:29-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  our story. Yes, to a point, we've got to, but it's not so much that we're standing on a stage  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  beating a drum about why we're good agriculturalist. It's more of the fact that we can sit down with  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:42):**  somebody that has a genuine concern and we're not radicalized about that. I've made mistakes  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  in my professional speaking career that will always be with me, but those mistakes really  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  are good lessons learned where I've spoken on behalf of large chemical companies and I've spoken  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  on behalf of large equipment companies. Just because it gave me the platform to be able to  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:05):**  highlight what I was doing as a producer, those reasons that I did that were for the wrong reason.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  Now, my attitude and my idea of how a farmer gets connected back into society, it's not just on  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  social media sitting here and when somebody attacks saying, well, you're killing the planet  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  with a GMO. I'm saying, you know what, is there a genuine concern there? Is there something that I'm  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  doing that I need to change with my practice and I need to be able to rectify that situation?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  And acknowledging that I do make mistakes, that I am human. And I think a lot of farmers are very  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:42):**  proud in the way that their grandfather farmed and they have not come up with the idea that,  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  you know what, that might not be the best way to do it. And so we've got to show a more human side  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  without showing the hillbilly side. Yeah, that's a great way of expressing it. We haven't had this  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:20:58):**  conversation yet. I sense we may be at different places on the spectrum and different places in our  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:03):**  journey and our perceptions of the use of pesticides and chemicals and GMOs. I can certainly  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  express that I have significant reservations about the way that we are using them. And I think  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  we cannot continue our pattern of the last six or seven decades or longer than that in the way that  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  we have degraded our soils from where they were 400 years ago. And we also can't continue the  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  pattern, I don't believe, of continuing to use significant quantities of endocrine disrupting  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  pesticides in and on our food supply. We need to figure out how to solve those problems.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  And we need to embrace those challenges and we also need to communicate. We need to acknowledge  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  the challenges that exist, bridges that need to be built, and then also engage in actually  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  building those bridges, not just have the conversation about it but also do it.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  Yeah. Well, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Where do you think we are with consumer perception  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:21:58):**  and how we really engage in that conversation? Well, I think there's a lot of correlations with  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  the statement that you said and it ties itself politically. I know last night there was a big  
**[0:22:11-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  conversation over fracking and oil production and energy and that ties itself back to where we are  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  in agriculture as well. What are we doing that's actually building what we have? To answer the  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  question, do I think that the rate that we in agriculture are going with the supplies that we  
**[0:22:32-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  have in front of us is sustainable? Absolutely not. I have been a proponent of Jefide for a long time.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  Just because I was sold on the idea that it would be able to help me in a drought situation,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  that it would be able to be an instant cure. But what I'm starting to learn is regardless of GMO  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  or conventional grown, if you put a band-aid on a wound long enough, the wound eventually will just  
**[0:23:00-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:00):**  become, you're not treating the situation. And if we do not look at this responsibly,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  that we are going to create a bigger issue than we already have today. Now, how do we do that?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  This is like you were talking about, the rubber's got to meet the road. We've got to get to a spot  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:25):**  where for me and the practices that I've built, I'm willing to step out on the ledge and say,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:31):**  I am not the best farmer in the world. And I understand that the practices that I have  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  put into my operation were band-aids. We talk about the use of nitrogen. And when we started  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  to put nitrogen on fields, we started to look at this real increase in production. And we're like,  
**[0:23:52-0:24:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  wow, yeah, I mean, if some is good, then more is better. But we've now made our ecosystem  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:02):**  dependent on that just to survive. And we're not seeing the yields that we saw before.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  It's because we're not looking at the core problem that we had in the beginning. It's  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:11):**  what lies beneath the topsoil. It's what's underneath that. And so what I want to do is  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:17):**  I want to figure out what is my five-year plan to remove myself from using genetically modified,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:23):**  removing myself from having to use chemicals day in and day out to make sure that we are  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  growing a sustainable style crop. And I want to do this where I know that I am building my  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:34):**  soil structure. I am building a crop that is something that I am extremely proud of. And I'm  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  proud of what we're growing now, even as a genetically modified cotton crop. I look at  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  the practices that we use, and I look at what people around the country do. And yes, when you  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  look at the average, I would say that we do a very, very good job of growing that crop.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:53):**  At the same time, if I can grow that crop and not have to worry about something that was developed  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  in the lab, or if I don't have to worry about something that was concocted that I have to run  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:01):**  through the boom of a sprayer that is something that I would not want to eat or drink, then I need  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  to make a hard look at that. It's not getting soft or it's not getting hippie or whatever.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  You want to say it's the fact that I want my kids to be able to grow up and say, hey, dad,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:17):**  dad made a decision that he was going to help the environment instead of band-aid an issue.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:24):**  And so now where the rubber meets the road is just how we roll this plan together. And is it  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  sustainable to farm where we farm? Is it sustainable to do what we do? It is. But we have to make the  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  right decision at the right time. We can't just flip the switch one night and say, hey, guess what,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  guys? We're organic today. And everybody looks at us and they're like, what in the, what?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:48):**  We don't have the pavers in place. We don't have the groundwork. The Lego is laid out  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  before we can build what we want to build. So now we have to get to the point where we are  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:25:57):**  building that. And it's going to take some pain. It's going to take some finances, but that's the  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  direction that we're going to head. A moment ago, earlier in our conversation, you expressed  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  frustration with the word sustainable and you twice described your, the future of your operation  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  as possibly being more sustainable. So tell me more about that frustration you have with that  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  word and what do you prefer? Yeah, that's it. You say that and then I sit here and I use the word  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:22):**  sustainable five times, right? Well, the biggest thing is the definition of sustainability is going  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  to change in everybody's mind. My view of sustainability versus your view of sustainability  
**[0:26:35-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:35):**  could be complete opposites. For me, sustainability is making a move into a style of growing that is  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  doing nothing but helping this, the situation that I have. So if it's, if it's reducing nitrogen use  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:52):**  by 5%, then that's a sustainable approach to me, that I am sustainably starting to move in a  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:26:57):**  direction that I don't have to rely on nitrogen. That again is why I hate the word because somebody  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:03):**  could sit there and say, well, our practices are more sustainable than they've ever been,  
**[0:27:08-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  but they only decrease pesticide use by 0.5%. So for us, sustainability is being able to not only  
**[0:27:17-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  keep an employee and empower our employees, but to have them have a sense of fulfillment with a  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  work that they do. And the same kind of fulfillment comes from the people that are going to use our end  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  product while limiting use of our natural resources. That would be my definition of  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:36):**  sustainable. I'm going to shift gears and go back to where we had this conversation earlier  
**[0:27:44-0:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  about taking back control of our future and being price makers, being involved in the processing  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:52):**  aspects. This is actually something that I believe is very important. I believe that if we look at  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:27:58):**  the future of agriculture, we need to develop more decentralized and more regionalized, localized  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:06):**  food sheds across not just North America, but around the globe for that matter. The question I'd have  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:12):**  for you, you've considered, you've gone through this process with a couple of different crops.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  You're hoping to do so with more crops. What advice would you have for other producers in taking back  
**[0:28:23-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  control of processing or guiding the process of being price makers? Yeah, so you have to find your  
**[0:28:32-0:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:32):**  threshold of pain that you're willing to accept. That pain is going to be based on how much are you  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:40):**  willing to sacrifice. Are you willing to sacrifice everything that you have to be able to do that?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  Are you willing to sacrifice everything that you have to be able to make a switch? It's just like  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  me transitioning towards a natural approach at Growing Crops. If we are going to be price  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  setters, then we're going to have to break the chains of what the food supply looks like today.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  You can say it's radical. You can say it's anarchist, whatever you want to say about our  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  food supply. But what we've done as a culture and a society is we've allowed our minds to be  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:13):**  able to say, hey, easy is better. And the fact that I can go to a large value store and I can  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:20):**  pick up everything I need in 15 minutes or they'll bring it out to my car and that just makes it so  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  much better for me. We've got to be able to find the people that are willing to say, hey, there is  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  value in what you do and there is value in the fact that you are going to go against the norm  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  to allow me to be a part of something that sustains my lifestyle. And so as somebody is  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  going to go into the market and market it directly to the consumer, they are going to have to allow  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  the consumer into their life and into the ways that they are producing their crops.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  And I want to be able to get people to the fact that if I was going to plant, let's just say I  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  was going to plant 100 acres of carrots next year, I would love to be able to say that it was almost  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  a hundred acres of fruit. But what we've done is we've taken the power away from the grower.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  We've allowed a person that's willing to do the smooth talking in the middle to take control of  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:14):**  what that market is going to look like. And that person is able, and I've got good friends that  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  are brokers, you know, and I love them to death, but they're not here at four o'clock in the morning  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:24):**  when the power goes out. They're not here when the hailstorm rolls through. They're not here when the  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:29):**  market crashes. They're there just to make sure that there's so much loaded on the truck and it's  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  just going to be a lot of work. I looked at when Walmart started doing this direct consumer,  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  we looked at that in the onion business. What ended up happening is the company was able to  
**[0:30:45-0:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  come in using ethnicity, sex, and a market tactic to be able to say that, yes, it's woman-owned or  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  woman-run or female-owned and ran, and it comes from a Native American tribe. And we're going to  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:00):**  get that market tactic done. And we're going to have to go back and say, okay, we've got a group  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  of growers that are going to sell you these onions from these growers. They're going to turn around  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  and they're going to sell those onions to Walmart. And we've lost complete control of our food supply.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  We've lost the fact that it's got to go from here to there. And we've lost the fact that we've got  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  to go from here to there. And we've lost the fact that we've got to go from here to there.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  And we have no control over that. And so what we have to do is we have to look back to,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  this gets extremely political in my view, and I love politics. You have any scotch over there?  
**[0:31:38-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  We can get into this. It'll be a long day. But the big thing is if we want to have an America  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  that is healthier, then we're going to have to be able to work for that. It's just like when  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  you start to work out and your body hurts and your sword and all of those kinds of things. But for us,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:31:58):**  we've got to bring the power back to the person that's going to deliver the crop to the grocery  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  store. What grocery store are you comfortable with? Is it the guy that owns it that employs  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  locals down the road? Or is it the guy that just works for a large, massive company that throws  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:12):**  cheap food out there? Where's the butcher? We just went on an elk hunt and got into the butcher.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:19):**  And we were sitting there talking to him and he's like, I can't keep up. He's like, I can't do this  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:24):**  anymore. He said that, you know, the money's good. It's all there. He said, but I can't keep up with  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:28):**  that. And so that's where it all boils back down to. Do we as Americans get to a point,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  do we as a world, as a society, as a human race, do we get back to the point where we take control  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:41):**  of our destiny by opening the butcher shop or the bakery? Do we get to the point where we're  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  delivering boxes of lettuce back? And can we do that on a large scale? Which I think the answer  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:51):**  of that is yes, we definitely can. It's just going to take pivotal shifts in people's perceptions and  
**[0:32:56-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:32:56):**  mindsets to allow us to do that. It's a radical way of thinking. When you open the political can  
**[0:33:04-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  of worms, this reminds me of a conversation that at first glance, or my first response to it was  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  that it was perhaps rather insensitive, but I think we're having a good conversation here. So  
**[0:33:17-0:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  I'm going to open it up. Arden Anderson was one of my mentors, medical doctor, or perhaps a DO.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:25):**  And I have other colleagues who've expressed similar sentiments as well. Their perception,  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  and I shouldn't just say their perception, but actually the data that they are putting together  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  and the experiences they are having in dealing with people's health,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  is very straightforward. They're willing to, and Arden actually has a degree in public health as  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  well. They are saying that our modern food system is making people sick. And so Arden made the  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  comment, he said, yes, farmers are not being paid well, and they are not making money in many cases.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  They're not being financially successful in the long term, and they are getting paid well. And  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  they are getting paid exactly for the quality that they produce. They are being paid for the  
**[0:34:12-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  quality of job that they are doing, which seems like a rather harsh and perhaps insensitive  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  perspective. And yet looking at it from his perspective, it is completely real that people  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:26):**  are becoming sick because of the lack of quality in our food supply. Of course, we could have a big  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:31):**  conversation about pricing mechanisms and government influence and the influence of  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  policies on pricing and cheap food policy that we have here in the United States. This is a much  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  bigger conversation. I absolutely understand that. I think it is something for us to consider and to  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  look at, to ask the question, okay, we're not comfortable with not controlling our destiny and  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:34:54):**  with not getting the price for food that we believe that we are producing that it is worth,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  but are we producing the quality that deserves to be compensated? And then, of course, the flip  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  side of that is once we do produce that quality, how can we ensure that we are compensated for  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:10):**  producing that quality? Yeah, I mean, it goes back to kind of what I was getting at and the fact  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  that we've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere, right? I mean, we've got to get to  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  a point where we're willing to, just like we do with a chafe company, it is a natural  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  it is a naturally grown alfalfa, non-GMO. We're not spraying and doing all those kind of things  
**[0:35:35-0:35:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  that a normal desert southwest alfalfa grower would do, but we've made the line in the sand  
**[0:35:42-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:42):**  that said we're different. The quality of what we do is different and we are going to demand  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  that we are paid differently. The issue with the topic that we have, and again, you're correct,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  it is very sensitive because I have lots of good friends that are large-scale and small-scale  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  commodity-style growers. How do we get to a point where we can use, one, what we produce,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  where we're not dependent on a foreign country to process what we need, and two, how do we get to  
**[0:36:18-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  a spot where we incentivize a grower to grow something that is more nutritious, that is safer,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  that is, and these are all words that I've been in my media training classes that I had back in the  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  day, that people are saying, you know, don't have this conversation, you know, this is a wormhole  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  that you don't want to get into, but in all reality what we have to do is we've got to get  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  to the point where we're willing to say, I will take steps back ensuring that I will make more  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  money as long as it is something that is going to be viable for future generations. And then  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  in my mind it makes complete and perfect sense. It's just we haven't found that mechanism that  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  changes that topic. I guess not to just get stuck in a vortex of the conversation,  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:07):**  my mind is that this starts with our federal government and the fact that we have got to get  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  to a point with our federal government where we are not regulating based on the monetary side,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  but our regulations turn themselves into an incentive. And I look at what happens,  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  you know, and people say, well, look at the organic program, it's an incentive, it's an  
**[0:37:33-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:33):**  incentive for you to grow organically. The problem with just switching over and growing organically  
**[0:37:43-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  is we haven't done enough in our own peer groups to go ahead and sit back and justify what was  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  going on. Someone's saying, well, look at all the weed seed that you're putting out there,  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:53):**  look at, you know, corn's all chewed up with worms or, you know, all of these kinds of things,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:37:59):**  when in all reality we need to be sitting there looking and saying, okay,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  if we're transitioning, if we're, and this is not just about organic, but this is about food  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  production in general. If we knew that we were going to get more for what we were producing,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:12):**  how do we get our federal government to incentivize that and not regulate what we're doing?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:18):**  And I don't have that answer. As you say, it is a big conversation and it's not a conversation  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  that I think we need to typically specifically unwrap in this discussion, but there is another  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  conversation I would like to have with you. Many times the guests that I have here on the podcast  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  are in a different place on the spectrum in terms of adopting what we refer to as regenerative  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  agricultural practices. In many cases, they may have been using them for a decade or three or  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:49):**  four decades in some cases. The question that I have for you is earlier in our conversation,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:38:56):**  we were talking about how innovative many farmers are. They're capable of coming up with many  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:05):**  machinery innovations, different cropping systems, innovative solutions for difficult challenges.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:11):**  And yet, on the other hand, when the moment we begin having a conversation about considering  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  different types of cultural management practices or different types of farming systems,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  for many growers have a borderline allergic reaction. There is some level of opposition  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:30):**  in many cases to considering different types of management practices from the exact same growers  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:36):**  who can be very innovative in developing new machinery, for example. Why do you think that is?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:43):**  Well, you remember the time that you stole the cookie and you were able to...  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  That cookie was really sweet by the way.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  Yeah, you stole that cookie and you ate it and you still had crumb on your lip,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  but your mom was going to sit there and say, I know you stole the cookie. Why don't you just  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  come out and tell me? And you're going to sit there and your sinful normal reaction is going  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  to sit there and tell you, I am going to fight this with all my might, at least I did. I was  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:13):**  going to sit here and I was going to fight because I was right. Even though I was wrong,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  I was going to prove the fact that I was right. And what's happened is we've been ingrained in  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  agriculture, that the way that past generations have done this and the new technologies that are  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  offered to us are those of which make us better or sustainable or regenerative, whatever word you  
**[0:40:33-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  want to use. But we're willing to fight for that. The issue that we see is when a small scale grower  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  finds success in what they're doing, the large scale guy goes, well, that man bun hippie wearing  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:47):**  and Subaru driving person has no idea of what it's like to form this many acres. And there's no way  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  we could be sustainable in doing that. And the other conversation from the person that's growing  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  small scale is saying, well, why in the world are you growing that many acres to start off with?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  Like, what, why are you doing that? And so there's this great cat and dog fight that always happens.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  And we always want to prove why we're wrong instead of sitting there and saying,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:10):**  and this is something that I believe, and I always tag it on my Instagram as, you know,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  I want to be a better human. I want to be able to have the conversation with a person that thinks  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  they're doing it right. And I want to know why. And if they don't think that I'm doing it right,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:23):**  then I want to have the conversation of what their perception of my, my basis is. And it's a  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:29):**  dangerous world to play in, but at the same time, it's the most rewarding because there's things  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:33):**  that we implement into our own practices that somebody might not think is the best idea or the  
**[0:41:38-0:41:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  best way to do it. But in all reality, if it's doing what makes us, and I hate to say it this  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:45):**  way, feel better because we know we're doing something that's positive, it's good. The fact  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:49):**  that people in agriculture are going to lash out against somebody else. And I guarantee you when  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  this airs, I'll have plenty of people that will blow me up and say, Jay, I can't believe you  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  would talk about, you know, going away from everything you believe in. I'm not going away  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  from everything I believe in. But what I am saying is I am, I am at a point in my life,  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  I'm at a point in our company's life, that we want to make sure that we're making changes  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:12):**  to make us a better farm. And if that is having conversations with the Subaru driving man bun  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  farmer, I need to have those conversations. And if it's the same thing with, you know,  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:23):**  Bubba Joe Gentry out there that farms 200,000 acres and figure out what the economies of scale  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  did to make him more successful. Let's get a hybrid of this thing together. And that's where  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:32):**  I want to be. I find it interesting that the way you framed your response in terms of stealing the  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  cookie from the cookie jar, and the reaction that we have to that is essentially a guilt reaction.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  That begs the question, do we feel even subconsciously some level of guilt about  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:53):**  practices that we are engaged in? Is there a recognition that what we are doing is not well  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:42:57):**  for the ecosystem? But I think it works both ways. Because I think there's a lot of people  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:02):**  that are in the natural environment of growing, that will have the same reaction because of  
**[0:43:09-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  tactics used or because of circumventing around a system in some ways, not all. But there's the  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  same level of reaction. So it's a Republican versus a Democrat. And when it comes down to  
**[0:43:24-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:24):**  the way people are reacting with each other, instead of saying, hey, yes, I have made mistakes  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  and being honest and saying, if there's ways that I can come out of what I've done and I've learned  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  from those mistakes, those are the people that find success in farming. And so, yes, there is a  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:42):**  level of guilt that will definitely subside. In my personal opinion, will be, and I've got some  
**[0:43:49-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  great friends that are surely organic. And to listen to their side of the story and to get them  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  fired up, it's guilt. And on my side, if there's practices I'm doing that I'm not 100% proud of,  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  yes, absolutely, it's guilt. I find this discussion really intriguing because there's this  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  phenomenon that I have observed that I've just referred to as the cognitive dissonance, where  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  some growers, and I can include myself in this because I was there when we started out on this  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  pathway. We express the desire of producing high quality food or high quality fiber. We say we  
**[0:44:26-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:26):**  want to produce really healthy food for people. And then on the other flip side, because we have  
**[0:44:35-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  a market that has zero tolerance for insect damage or for disease damage, we spray intense insecticide  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  applications and fungicide applications so that we have marketable fruits to sell. I think what we do  
**[0:44:49-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  ourselves at this service is we largely tend to just reject out of hand the perceived concerns  
**[0:44:59-0:45:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  that consumers have about pesticide applications. And we don't seek to understand the impact that  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  those pesticides can actually have on the human organism and on the human body. There is this  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:13):**  saying that I forget who it's originally attributed to, but seek first to understand and then to be  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:19):**  understood. And I believe there is a challenge that we have had and that I have had in the past  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  in the farming community to seek first to understand the consumer's point of view and  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  the scientist's point of view who are legitimately concerned about the impact that pesticides might  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:36):**  have. For example, I'm just picking that out as one case in point. So we are immediately seeking  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  to be defensive rather than seeking first to understand the other's point of view.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  Yep, I agree 110% with that statement. I think it's one of those things to  
**[0:45:52-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  the society that we live in today. Look at social media and the people that are doing well in social  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  media, there's a couple of reasons that they're doing well. One, either they're showing every  
**[0:46:05-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:05):**  nitty-gritty detail of why they fail and they succeed, which is what I want to do, or there's  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  the people that are wildly popular. Look at the Kardashians. I don't follow them, obviously,  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:18):**  but at the same time, the reason that they are where they're at is because they paint a picture  
**[0:46:22-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:22):**  that life is perfect. Life is beautiful. You can alter your body or buy the best clothes or do  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  whatever you want to do, and it makes people wish that they were into that mindset. And so when we  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:35):**  talk about food production, we want to make sure that the tomato, if we're buying it, the power  
**[0:46:40-0:46:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  that I have as a consumer to buy the perfectly ripe tomato that does not have any sun scald or  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:47):**  it's perfectly red and round, we've got that to where we demand that. We've exalted ourselves as  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:46:54):**  a society where we want that. Instead of just saying, what is the best for us? What tastes the  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  best? What's healthiest? The challenge with the Kardashian approach to presenting ourselves to the  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  world is that fundamentally it is inauthentic. Yes, absolutely. We live in a world today where  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  when you are inauthentic, we all know it. We all sense it. We sense it when other people  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  are inauthentic. We know that other people perceive it when we are inauthentic,  
**[0:47:25-0:47:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  and it's not a foundation to establish a strong dialogue. It's not a foundation that you can  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:32):**  have a good conversation on. John, the most miserable times of my life is when I've tried  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:38):**  to paint myself in somebody else's picture. To be completely honest, when I've tried to live to the  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  standard of what somebody else portrays their life to look like is when I find the biggest failures  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  in my life. When in all reality, that's not a failure. It's called being human. And the fact  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  that we were created uniquely the way that we are and that we are not ever going to be able to be,  
**[0:48:01-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:01):**  I'm not going to look like Kim Kardashian, thank God. But the mainstay of that whole concept or  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  that whole analogy is we've got to be happy with who we are and we've got to do what is best for  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  us. And in doing so and having that sense of security, the sense of I am making decisions  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  based on what I know is true and right in my heart is going to be able to be translated and then  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  marketed that way as well. And that's the journey that I find myself on. That's the quote unquote  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  mule I'm writing at the moment. I think it'll be something that I will spend my whole life  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  on that journey. And that's where I want to spend my life. I want to continue to work on what makes  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  me a better farmer, a better husband, a better father, a better Instagram or whatever you want  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  to say it. But it's just being real genuine authentic and just saying, you know what,  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  if somebody doesn't really like the way that I do something, instead of just saying, well,  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  to hell with them, I'm going to sit down and say, let's have a genuine talk about what their  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:07):**  perception of what I do is. And if there's something there that actually hits a nerve  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:12):**  or strikes a sense of guilt, then maybe I'm doing something that's not right. And maybe I need to  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:16):**  start looking at a different way of that. At the same time, having the tenacity to say that if  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  someone's just mindlessly attacking, they always say that the loudest boos are from the cheapest  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  seats, that you still have enough heart that you get yourself propelled through the situation  
**[0:49:31-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  understanding that you're on this journey and this is your journey and somebody's not  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  probably not going to understand it. Jay, this has been a fascinating conversation.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  I had no idea which direction the discussion was going to go. It's been a complete joy. And  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_S3_Ep20_Jay_Hill_Final_Audio.mp3#t=0:49:47):**  I think we could have other quite interesting conversations as well. So thank you for being

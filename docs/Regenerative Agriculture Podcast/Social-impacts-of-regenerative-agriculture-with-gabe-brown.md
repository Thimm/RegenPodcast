**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm John Kempf, hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:33):**  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:06):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:01:33):**  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:30):**  My pleasure. Good to be here, John.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:32):**  So, Gabe, you have a fascinating story about the work that you have done on your farm,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:38):**  the successes that you've had, and some of the changes that you've been able to make over the  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:41):**  years. What are some of your most memorable moments that led you to where you are today?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:46):**  Well, I guess it all started back, I was born and raised in town. I wasn't from a farm or ranch,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:02:54):**  but took an interest at a young age and happened to marry a gal whose parents had a farm and  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:01):**  very conventional, heavy tillage and use of synthetic etc. But worked into that  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:07):**  and was able to purchase it in 1991. But because I was not born and raised on a farm,  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:14):**  I didn't have any of these preconceived notions. So I was open to new ideas. And I had a 1991,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:20):**  my wife and I purchased part of the operation from her parents. And 1993, I had a good friend  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:26):**  of mine in the northern part of North Dakota who was no till. And he convinced me, and it didn't  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:32):**  take a lot of convincing because it just made sense to me in our rather semi-arid environment,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:38):**  we were trying to save moisture. He said, Gabe, you need to go no till in order to save time and  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:43):**  moisture. And that just made sense. But he also said, I'm going to give you a little advice. If  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:47):**  you do it, he said, tell all your tillage equipment, then you're never tempted to go back.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:51):**  And I actually did that. I had to sell my tillage equipment in order to be able to afford the no  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:03:56):**  till drill we purchased. And so that started me down this path. But the biggest change in our life  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:04):**  came about the years 1995 through 98. We lost two crops in a row to hail, then one to drought. And  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:12):**  then the fourth year in a row, we lost the crop to hail again. And I tell people those four years of  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:19):**  natural disasters were absolute hell to go through. But they were absolutely the best thing that  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:24):**  could have happened to me because of the fact that financially, the bank wasn't going to loan us any  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:30):**  more money. I had to learn, okay, how am I going to make a living off this land without the use of  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:36):**  all of these synthetic inputs? And so those couple of factors were the biggest driving force in our  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:45):**  move towards regenerative agriculture. What were the key pieces that you changed during and after  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:51):**  that four-year period that were substantially different from the way that you've been farming  
**[0:04:55-0:05:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:04:55):**  before? Right. Well, when you think about it, the first year, 1995, we lost 100% of our crop to hail.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:03):**  It occurred the day before I was going to start combining our spring wheat crop. Spring wheat was  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:08):**  our major cash crop at the time. Well, we all of a sudden laid all this biomass down on the soil  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:14):**  surface. So we got all this armor protecting the soil. Then 1996 come along, same thing,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:20):**  lost 100% of the crop to hail again, again laying down tremendous biomass. And we're leaving all that  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:28):**  soil intact. We're not disturbing that soil ecosystem. Well, because that hailstorm was  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:35):**  so devastating, we didn't even have enough feed for the livestock. So I had to go in and feed  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:40):**  like sorghum, sedan grass, and cowpeas. And I was intelligent enough to know the value of seeding  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:47):**  legumes with grasses and those simple things we can do to benefit production and increase biomass.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:05:55):**  So I did that. Well, it got to the point where we were virtually with no money, I couldn't afford  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:02):**  to even put up hay. So we turned livestock into those acres and graze. So this series of natural  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:09):**  disasters was actually the best thing that could have happened from a soil ecosystem, soil funk  
**[0:06:15-0:06:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:15):**  standpoint, because we were lowering synthetic inputs, which obviously led to not as much carbon  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:24):**  being burned through because of the overuse of particularly nitrogen fertilizer. Then we weren't  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:30):**  applying phosphorus fertilizers. So that led to buildup in mycorrhizal fungi, along of course,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:36):**  with no soil disturbance. So all these little things that nature was forcing us to do was  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:42):**  actually advancing soil funk. So it was a period of events. And I tell people very honestly, I had  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:49):**  no idea what a cover crop was back then. I had no idea about soil health, soil function, but just  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:06:55):**  due to circumstances, we were going down that path. You've mentioned a couple of different  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:00):**  pieces that you worked on that you incorporated, perhaps not by intention, but rather by default,  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:06):**  that improved soil health, no till cover crops, livestock. A question that I've been asked on a  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:12):**  number of conversations recently is many people are beginning to recognize the value and the  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:17):**  importance of cover crops, but there's still a lot of hesitation around incorporating livestock  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:24):**  into agriculture ecosystems. So the question I would have for you is in your estimation,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:29):**  how important do you believe it is to incorporate livestock to the overall ecosystem? Well, that  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:34):**  comes back to let's step back and take a look at how these particular, these fairy soils were  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:42):**  formed. They were formed over eons of time, with large herds of bison, elk being moved across the  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:50):**  landscape by predators, trampling, grazing, and defecating, and urinating. And we had this natural  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:07:58):**  nutrient cycling occurred, and then the animals would move on long periods of rest and recovery,  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:03):**  which allowed for maximum amount of carbon to be pumped into the soil. And soil health revolves  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:10):**  around carbon cycle. And so that's how our prairie soils were formed. Well, look what we've done in  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:18):**  our monoculture type mindset. We've removed the diversity and we've removed the animals from the  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:24):**  landscape, and now we're simply not pumping as much carbon into the soil. Now, can we advance  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:30):**  soil health without livestock? Absolutely. I tell people I have several quarters of land that were  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:36):**  just not able to graze livestock on, surrounded by housing developments and no water, and it's just  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:42):**  not worth the hassle to incorporate livestock onto those acres. We've still significantly advanced  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:49):**  the soil health on those acres. However, we will never have those soils to the point where we  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:08:57):**  don't have the soils that we're able to graze livestock on. And the main thing, there's many  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:04):**  benefits of having livestock on cropland, but the one thing I think producers are really missing out

**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:22):**  per acre on the cropland acres we were able to graze livestock on. And that's significant. With  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:29):**  margins where they are in commodity agriculture today, what producer wouldn't want $224 per acre?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:36):**  Now, I'm not saying all producers will want to go through the things we're doing with livestock,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:41):**  but in saying that, they're missing a major opportunity there. I tell people,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:47):**  if you have the ability, cover crops are an absolute no-brainer from a soil health standpoint,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:53):**  but if you can integrate livestock, that's a way to convert those cover crops into dollars. And I  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:09:58):**  tell producers, even if you don't want to do it, there's many young people in the communities  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:03):**  around the country who would love the opportunity and chance to run some livestock and enter  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:09):**  agriculture that way. Why not benefit your resource, help a young person and integrate  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:14):**  some livestock under your cropland? That's a great idea for incorporating the next generation.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:19):**  And also, when you talk about the economics and the profitability, an additional $220 net per  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:25):**  acre, isn't that a larger net than most growers are getting from producing corn? Well, yes. On  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:33):**  our operation, we sell very few commodities. We're doing value-added direct to consumers simply  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:40):**  because of the dollar return we can generate by doing so. But I just shake my head at commodity  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:47):**  agriculture today and I ask the question, I have no desire to produce commodities and I really  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:10:54):**  don't understand why people do. There's just no money in it unless there's a major drought  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:01):**  somewhere or some external force. We tie our hands, so to speak, when we produce commodities.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:08):**  And I'm just, obviously by talking to me, you'll get to understand I am not a proponent of the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:15):**  current production model. I think it leaves too many decisions in hands other than our own. I  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:22):**  tell people we are profitable every year on our operation because we set our own price. We take  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:30):**  that out of somebody else's hands, put it in our own. So when you're able to do that, that just  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:36):**  really adds to your bottom line and increases profitability significantly. When I think about  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:42):**  the implications of what you are describing, there is this entire industrial ecosystem that has  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:50):**  evolved to handle commodity crops. When you think of all of the combines and equipment,  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:11:58):**  equipment manufacturing, logistics, grain elevators, and feedlots that have all evolved  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:03):**  to accommodate this commodity cropping mindset, what you're essentially describing is displacing,  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:10):**  has the potential, in my understanding, to displace practically all of that or at least  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:15):**  the great majority of it by bringing livestock back onto the land to graze crops and cover crops  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:21):**  directly on the soil. And that has some substantial ramifications, obviously not only for  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:27):**  long-term soil health on a macro level, but also for the agriculture industry as it exists today.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:35):**  Yes, you're right. And let's be honest, it's not going to change overnight. It's going to change  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:41):**  slowly over time. However, the movement we're seeing, and I spend a lot of my time dealing with  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:49):**  the human health aspect of production agriculture. And we have a human health crisis,  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:12:56):**  we have a human health crisis in this country. America spends more on healthcare than any other  
**[0:13:00-0:13:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:00):**  country in the world, yet we lead the developed nations in cancer, ADD, ADHD, Parkinson's,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:08):**  Alzheimer's, autoimmune diseases, obesity, and the list goes on and on. Well, why is that? Now,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:13):**  let's be very honest, I'm not in no way blaming it all on farmers and ranch. It's due to our  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:19):**  sedentary lifestyle. But a lot of it, farmers and ranchers have to accept part of the blame because  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:26):**  the nutrient density of the foods that we're producing is a fraction of what it was 50 to 70  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:32):**  years ago. So how are we going to change this downward trend in human health? It has to start  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:39):**  with the soil and it has to start with the movement of nutrients through the ecosystem and  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:45):**  inevitably ending up in our bodies. Well, you look at what's causing the downward trend in  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:52):**  nutrient density in our foods, a lot of it is related to the health of our soil ecosystem. That,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:13:58):**  I profess, comes about from our industrialized, commoditized mindset. And so, if we're going to  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:05):**  truly affect human health, it has to start at the soil level and the ecosystem level and what  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:11):**  farmers and ranchers are doing. Okay, then it gets back to using the principles of a healthy soil  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:18):**  ecosystem, just what I talked about when we started about how we have to do what's necessary  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:24):**  to advance the health of our soils, get more nutrients, plant secondary metabolites that are  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:31):**  moving through the plant and then inevitably into the human food chain. Well, we're not going to do  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:38):**  that with commodity agriculture. And just this past winter here, I've spent a great deal of time  
**[0:14:46-0:14:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:46):**  with several large organic companies working on regenerative protocols where they are actually  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:54):**  driving change on their producers and their producers are going to be paid accordingly  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:14:59):**  through the regenerative practices they do on their operation. And it all comes about because  
**[0:15:05-0:15:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:05):**  these large companies know that the next real wave that's coming, so to speak, is the focus on human  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:13):**  health. So, they're going to make more money if they have higher nutrient dense foods. The only  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:18):**  way they can get that is by improving the health of the ecosystem, soil ecosystem. And so, it all  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:25):**  comes about in a roundabout way, getting back to our system is broken with commodity industrialized  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:32):**  agriculture. Farmers and ranchers get a beat into them all, we got to feed the world, feed the world,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:37):**  feed the world. Well, there was some figures released here in December of 2017 that dated,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:45):**  we produced enough food on this world last year to feed 14 billion people. Well, think about that.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:15:55):**  We have approximately 7.8 billion people in the world, yet we produced enough food to feed 14  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:01):**  billion. So, farmers and ranchers are, you know, they're shooting themselves in the foot if they  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:06):**  think they got to increase production to feed the world. There's already enough production out there,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:11):**  you know. So, the only way you're going to differentiate yourself from everyone else  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:15):**  and to increase the value of what you're producing on your operation is you better be  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:21):**  producing nutrient dense food and then you have to set your own prices and be paid for it. And  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:27):**  that's what we're trying to do on our operation, that's what we're encouraging others to do also.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:31):**  Gabe, you brought up a number of absolutely fascinating points. There is this idea,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:38):**  even today, the numbers that you just shared surprised me a little bit, there is this  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:44):**  perception even today that we're not producing enough even for the current world population,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:50):**  yet you're describing that in fact that's not the case. We're overproducing much more than we need,  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:16:56):**  which essentially would indicate that we don't really have a production problem,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:00):**  we have a distribution problem. And I find that...  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:03):**  That is exactly right, John. Those figures, you know, enough to feed 14 billion people  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:08):**  is the highest I heard. I did find several places that state we've produced enough last year to feed  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:16):**  10 billion people. In saying that, there's over a billion people worldwide that go to bed hungry  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:23):**  every night and don't have enough food and it is exactly as you said, it's a distribution problem,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:29):**  it's not a product problem. The other thing we have to be very honest and look at is a lot of  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:35):**  what we produce does not go into human food consumption, and a lot of it is going obviously  
**[0:17:43-0:17:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:43):**  towards things like ethanol and then grain to feed cattle. And I will argue that, I tell people,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:52):**  I've slaughtered thousands of beef animals and I have yet to see one with a gizzard. So why are we  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:17:58):**  feeding beef animals grain? It does not make sense. Now in saying that, I'm going to be very honest  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:05):**  and tell you I will eat grain fed beef if grass fed isn't available and it's still a highly  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:10):**  nutritious nutrient dense product, but I will certainly would rather be grass finished beef  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:16):**  simply because of the health benefits of it and I prefer the taste of it, quite honest. So we have  
**[0:18:22-0:18:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:22):**  to look at all of production agriculture, what we're doing and you know our Soil Health Consulting  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:32):**  Partnership did a school in eastern Iowa and when we do schools in places like that, it absolutely  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:39):**  amazes me the mindset of producers in thinking that the only thing they can produce there is  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:45):**  corn and beans. The only thing they can produce corn and beans. There's not the infrastructure,  
**[0:18:49-0:18:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:18:49):**  there's not the market and I just really get disappointed by that quite honestly because that

**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:11):**  the problem is the current farm program. You know, let's face it, 95 plus percent and that's probably  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:17):**  on the light end of cropping decisions are based on revenue insurance and what people can make off  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:23):**  revenue insurance, guarantee themselves. And I quit being involved in any farm programs a number  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:29):**  of years ago because for one thing, I don't think the American public should be paying and subsidizing  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:36):**  my operation. If I can't make it on my own, I shouldn't be doing it. The other thing is why  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:42):**  would I want to tie my hand and be limited to what I can do on my operation? For instance, in 20,  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:49):**  here in near Bismarck, North Dakota, we've gone through a couple very dry years and when we  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:19:56):**  went into planting last spring, I had planned on putting more corn in but because we were so dry,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:04):**  I switched my cropping decisions accordingly. And due to that fact, I was able to harvest crops that  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:13):**  made me a decent profit last year, even though we only had 5.8 inches of rainfall during the growing

**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:25):**  industrialized mindset and producers need to learn how to adapt and observe and change according to  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:34):**  the dish. I've been fascinated by the mindset of growers which you just described and referring to  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:41):**  what you experienced in Iowa. It's intriguing to me that in the state of Iowa, any crop that is not  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:48):**  corn and soybeans is classified as a specialty crop. I mean alfalfa and wheat production are  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:20:53):**  classified as specialty crops in Iowa. And when you go back, prior to the freeze of, if I recall  
**[0:21:00-0:21:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:00):**  correctly, I believe 1946, prior to 1946, Iowa was sick in the nation for apple production. It was a  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:07):**  major apple growing region in the United States. Wow, I didn't realize that. That climate still  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:13):**  exists today. The climate hasn't shifted that substantially but there was just one freeze  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:18):**  that in which they lost a lot of trees and the entire industry never came back. And so when you  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:24):**  think of that, I mean I'm using apples as one example, but there was a diverse agricultural ecosystem  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:30):**  in Iowa in the 40s, 50s, and 60s that has, they were also, north central Iowa was the  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:37):**  black capital production of the world and that has completely disappeared. I shared with producers,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:44):**  and don't get me wrong Tony, it's not just eastern Iowa. I can go anywhere in the United States and  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:49):**  list similar stories, but I shared with attendees of our school, I shared the net returns, average  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:21:58):**  net returns over the past nine years on my operation. And my highest net returning crop per  
**[0:22:05-0:22:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:05):**  acre of my cash crop is cereal rye and hairy vetch combined in combination. Over the past nine years,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:13):**  our average net return per acre is $951. Now how many people out there grow rye and hairy vetch and  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:21):**  then combine it and sell it? Well not very many. Bingo. You know I often tell people, people laugh  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:27):**  at Gabe Brown because he's different. I laugh at them because they're all the same, right? Nobody  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:32):**  else is doing this, you know. It's just like my family and I have planted over 1,500 fruit and nut  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:40):**  trees the past four years are in our operation. How many peaches are being grown in North Dakota?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:45):**  You know what I can get for a North Dakota grown peach? Two to three dollars per peach. Why wouldn't  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:50):**  I do that, you know? I just laugh at people with their closed mindset, you know. And also I think  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:22:56):**  people don't realize, you know, here in the Midwest we're somewhat isolated from what's happening on  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:04):**  the coast. Well in my traveling and speaking, I spend a lot of time on the east and west coast,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:09):**  and you get talking to consumers out there. It's absolutely amazing. I visited with the producer  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:16):**  who is running 8,000 laying hens on past. He's selling his eggs for a dollar per egg.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:24):**  A dollar per egg and he just laughs. He says people can go to Walmart or wherever they want  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:29):**  and buy cheap eggs, but I can sell all I want at a dollar an egg, you know, because people are  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:34):**  willing to pay for it. Here in Bismarck, North Dakota we run 1,100 laying hens on past. You can  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:40):**  buy eggs at the local store for less than 70 cents a dozen. We're getting four dollars and  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:45):**  fifty cents a dozen and we can't even begin to keep up with demand because people, they see the  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:51):**  difference when they crack those eggs open. They want to know where their food comes from. So  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:23:56):**  people say, well I'm not going to raise chickens. I don't want anything to do with that. Okay,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:02):**  don't complain to me. You're not making money, you know. This isn't rocket science. Then think  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:06):**  of how we're feeding those hens. Well, I mentioned to you we grew the rye and hairy veg that I'm  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:12):**  selling as seed. We run it through a cleaner, take out all the screenings. That's how we're  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:16):**  feeding our chickens is screenings. So I'm taking a waste stream from one enterprise to fuel the  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:21):**  profit in another. That's just good business. That's all. That's just good business then,  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:25):**  you know, but so many people aren't willing to do these little things and then they wonder why  
**[0:24:30-0:24:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:30):**  they can't make any money. Yeah, I also have many colleagues and friends that I've met in my travels  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:38):**  who are doing similar things to what you're describing who are extraordinarily profitable.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:42):**  And not only are they profitable, but they are finding a lot of joy and fun in the work that  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:49):**  they are doing which didn't exist before they stepped outside of the typical boundaries of  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:54):**  doing what everyone else was doing. You're exactly right, John, and isn't it enjoyable to have people  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:24:59):**  come up to you? And I've had people in their 60s come up to me and say, Gabe, agriculture is fun  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:06):**  again. I'm enjoying this. We don't have the stress. My wife is happy, you know, we're not stressed out  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:12):**  over finances anymore. And, you know, I tell people, they may laugh at my chickens, but who  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:18):**  doesn't enjoy sitting watching the chicken, you know? I mean, it's a chicken. It's not like it's much  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:24):**  work. And it's enjoyable. I tell people, you know, I used to when I was in my conventional,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:30):**  quote unquote, mindset, I used to wake up every day trying to decide what I was going to kill that  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:35):**  day. Was it going to be a weed? Was it going to be a fungus? Was it going to be a pest? You know, I was  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:40):**  going to kill something every day. Now I wake up, how do I get more life on my operation? And it's  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:45):**  much, much more enjoyable working with life than death. That is, you're exactly right. I, in a  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:52):**  series of seminars a couple of years ago, I asked farmers the question, why do you farm? What was it  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:25:57):**  that attracted you to farming in the first place? And when you begin unwrapping the answers and  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:02):**  digging down into the foundational reasons that attracted growers to begin farming and to stay in  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:09):**  farming, it is really because of their appreciation and their desire to have a connection to life and  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:16):**  living process. And we really love watching seeds germinate in the spring. They love watching the joy  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:20):**  of a newborn animal. And we have unconsciously adopted a model of agriculture that is directly  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:27):**  antagonistic to those core values where we've adopted a model that is based on a warfare  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:33):**  mentality of search and destroy, identify a specific pest or pathogen and figure out how you  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:37):**  can kill it. And then of course, if you're not successful with the first weapon of choice, you  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:40):**  just get a bigger bomb and get a stronger pesticide. Right. And look where that's led us. You know,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:45):**  now we have weeds that are resistant to herbicides and et cetera, et cetera. And it's just leading us  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:51):**  down this path of decimation of the ecosystem, but it also has human health ramifications. And I  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:26:58):**  really think we as producers need to step back and look in the mirror and realize that the things  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:05):**  we're doing on our farm and ranch are impacting human health. And we have to take some responsibility  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:11):**  for those, for our actions. Yeah. I think in many cases, we as growers may have lost sight of the  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:16):**  fact that our primary responsibility is growing food. We talk about feeding the world, but it's  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:22):**  become a very, very abstract concept where it's for many of us, it's no longer real about actually  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:28):**  connecting to the people who are consuming that food. It's easy to distance ourselves from that.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:32):**  Correct. I'd like to go back to speaking a little bit about beef production. Today, there is a great  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:39):**  deal of dogma and a great deal of political dialogue around how beef is bad. Beef is bad  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:48):**  for the environment. We are consuming too much beef. We need to reduce our meat consumption,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:53):**  and we're not going to be able to feed the world with, if we continue to increase meat consumption  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:27:58):**  and emerging developing countries, developing economies increase their meat consumption.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:03):**  And yet this is a very different perspective from the one that you've been describing,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:09):**  where you believe livestock are actually an integral part of a regenerative agriculture ecosystem.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:14):**  So I have a few questions around that. I guess perhaps the one to begin with would be when you  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:20):**  think about quote unquote feeding the world, do you believe that it is possible, if you look at,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:26):**  well, let me begin over again. If you look at protein production per acre from a macro perspective  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:33):**  and being able to feed a growing world population a higher quality diet, can we increase meat  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:40):**  consumption globally and produce an equivalent or even greater amount of beef using the type of  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:46):**  system that you were describing than we can with corn production and feeding grain the way it  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:50):**  happens currently? That's a very good and pertinent question. Thanks for asking it, John. The answer  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:28:56):**  is absolutely yes. We can increase the, I'm going to say meat protein consumption, because it's not  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:02):**  only beef, it's other species of livestock also. Look at what we're doing now in production  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:09):**  agriculture. Animals are confined in lots, whether it be a feedlot, whether it be a large  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:15):**  vitamin dairy, whether it be hog production, find in buildings, poultry production, find in building,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:21):**  instead of having those animals out on the landscape. The issues that we're seeing and  
**[0:29:27-0:29:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:27):**  you often hear people demising beef consumption because of methane production. But what they don't  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:35):**  realize and fail to take into account, there was actually more ruminants on North America  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:42):**  pre-European settlement than there are now. Okay, if methane was is real issue, we should have had  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:48):**  higher methane emissions back then, right? No, the reason we didn't is because there's methanotrophs.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:29:54):**  And methanotrophs, organisms down near the soil surface, when a grazing animal emits methane,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:01):**  those methanotrophs latched onto it and use it as a food source. Okay, that's not happening with  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:07):**  animals in confinement. So the critics are correct in today's production model. But when we get out  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:14):**  animals out on the landscape, there's many benefits to having them out there. You know,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:19):**  it's a proven fact that the biology in the soil, microbiology is directly related to biology in the  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:26):**  rumen and also biology in the human gut. You know, we have billions of bacteria and fungi in our  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:33):**  guts also. So it's all tied together. Now getting back to answering your question about adding  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:40):**  protein and feeding more protein to people in the world. The current production model, okay,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:46):**  let's look at the average producer who's producing corn and soybeans. They're producing one commodity,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:52):**  either corn or soybean, one of those each year. Now look at a regenerative model. Okay, we can still  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:30:58):**  grow corn and soybeans. But what we're doing besides that is we're growing cover crops. And then  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:04):**  we're grazing those cover crops with beef on my operation, for instance, with beef, we've got  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:10):**  pastured hogs, got pastured poultry, we've got grass-finished lambs. I'm stacking so many more  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:16):**  enterprises. I just laugh at the notion, oh, you are not going to feed the world with regenerative  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:22):**  agriculture. Gee, I'm producing way more nutrient dense calories per acre than the industrial  
**[0:31:29-0:31:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:29):**  mindset is, plus it's a wider variety. The answer becomes we can't feed the world with the industrial  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:37):**  mind. We can produce enough commodities, but we can't produce enough nutrient dense food. We can  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:43):**  do that with the regenerative mindset because we stack so many more enterprises per acre. And  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:48):**  therein lies the big difference that nobody takes into account. They only look at monocultures  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:31:54):**  because they have that mindset that we got to look at one single thing. And we got to look at  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:00):**  the ecosystem as a whole, we got to look at all these stacked enterprises. We're going to produce  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:05):**  way more calories, nutrient dense calories per acre in a regenerative manner. That's incredible.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:11):**  That's exciting. That's exactly what I've been observing with growers that we have worked with  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:16):**  as well. And I wanted to hear your perspective on that. So that to me is incredibly inspirational  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:21):**  because it gives us a great deal of hope for the future. And when we think about the opportunities  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:28):**  that exist and the potential that exists to really develop an agricultural ecosystem that  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:33):**  can not only regenerate soil health and plant health and all these various pieces, but that  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:39):**  can also, where we can also begin having a legitimate conversation about growing food  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:44):**  as medicine and really helping to improve the health of the consumers who are consuming the  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:49):**  food that we're producing. You're exactly right, John. You know, there's a new book that just came  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:32:55):**  out this past year, What's Making Our Children Thick? And it was wrote by two doctors and they  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:01):**  take a look at what's happened to the health of society, particularly in the United States,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:08):**  over the past 50 to 70 years. And it's all that the real decline in human health has come about  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:17):**  when we change the production model from one of these very, very diverse farms that you talked  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:23):**  about were once in Iowa to the industrialized mindset. And as I mentioned earlier, I think a  
**[0:33:29-0:33:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:29):**  lot of it is tied to the health of and function of our ecosystems. And so it's to everyone's benefit,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:37):**  the producer, the farmer or rancher, when they diversify and start stacking more enterprises,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:44):**  it's to their benefit because it's going to increase profitability for them. And it's  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:48):**  inevitably to the benefit of society as a whole. And we haven't even started talking about, you  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:53):**  know, healing our watersheds and the problems, you know, water is becoming a larger and larger  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:33:58):**  issue throughout the world. And, you know, those ecosystem processes will be healed also as we  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:05):**  change from the current production model. Absolutely. Gabe, as you have developed these  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:09):**  systems, and if your thinking has evolved on your farm over the decades, what has been something  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:15):**  that has really puzzled you on your operation? Well, one of the things that puzzles me, you know,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:22):**  we're blessed. We get thousands of visitors coming to our ranch during the, it's amazing,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:27):**  they don't, they never come during the winter to North Dakota, it's always during the summer. But  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:32):**  you know, we've had visitors from 22 foreign countries in all 50 states the past five years,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:38):**  and every Canadian province. So we get a lot of visitors from all over and they come thinking,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:44):**  you know, they have in their mind that it's going to be this utopia. Well, no, I've got a working  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:49):**  farm and ranch like everybody else. And we have issues that we deal with. And one of the big ones  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:34:55):**  that I've struggled some with is perennial wheat. And obviously, as we move from an annual  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:03):**  cropping system, by that I mean one that was high use of synthetics that should have said as  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:10):**  a conventional type cropping system to more of this regenerative model, the annual weeds are  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:16):**  no longer an issue. They just don't bother as much. But it's the perennial weeds and trying to  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:21):**  get that puzzle figured out. Now, I really believe that the work that Dr. David Johnson is doing at  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:28):**  New Mexico State University with a high fungal component in his soil is going to be one of the  
**[0:35:34-0:35:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:34):**  keys to do figuring out that puzzle, so to speak. And I have been a big proponent for many, many  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:42):**  years on we have to get away from these bacterial dominant soils, we've got to get the fungal  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:47):**  activity back into our soils. But Dr. Johnson has helped me realize that it's even more important  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:35:53):**  than I thought. And so I'm happy in that our soil health folks was able to hire Dr. Johnson as a  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:01):**  technical advisor, and he's doing some work with us to teach us just what he's doing with this static  
**[0:36:08-0:36:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:08):**  compost, high fungal activity. And it's really is showing some promise on being able to mitigate  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:17):**  these perennial weed issues. So that's one of the things that has puzzled me the most. And I,  
**[0:36:22-0:36:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:22):**  like everybody else, I'm very, very cognizant of the fact that I am farming still a degraded  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:30):**  resource. I tell people I've been on thousands of operations all over the world, and I've never been  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:36):**  on a single operation, including my own, where the resource isn't degraded. So there's something to  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:41):**  learn for all of us. And it's just like a big jigsaw puzzle. We're learning all the time,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:46):**  trying to fit pieces together. Yeah, and of course, thinking about developing  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:51):**  fungal dominated soils, you have a substantial advantage in that you've developed a system  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:36:56):**  that incorporates a lot of perennials where you have an environment that can foster the  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:02):**  development and the preservation of fungal communities in the soil profile, which is  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:06):**  a critical element that may be missing on a more conventional farming operation.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:11):**  Right. That's right. And I tell producers, you know, producers are, and it's human nature to  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:18):**  have a million excuses. Wherever I travel, people, you know, I get many, many people coming up to me,  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:24):**  but Gabe, you don't understand, but Gabe, you don't understand. Our soils are different. Our  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:28):**  climate's different. Yes, it's different everywhere. But one thing, the principles  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:32):**  of healthy ecosystems are the same everywhere in the world where we go, you know, where there's  
**[0:37:37-0:37:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:37):**  production agriculture. The other thing producers just tend to not understand is that they can  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:44):**  influence how those ecosystems function by their management. And every ecosystem all over the world  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:50):**  has its unfair advantage. You mentioned some of the unfair advantages I have being located in  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:37:56):**  North Dakota. You know, I just did a school in North Carolina. They have unfair advantages in  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:02):**  that their growing season is much, much longer than mine, obviously. So they can cycle more  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:08):**  carbon, you know, than I can in any given. Now, due to their moisture, they're going to cycle  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:13):**  through that carbon, but, you know, faster, but they can grow more things. So they can compensate  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:19):**  for that. No matter where we are in the world, we have unfair advantage. And it's up to us as  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:24):**  producers to find those unfair advantages and then use them to our benefit. Exactly. What has been  
**[0:38:30-0:38:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:30):**  something that has surprised you? One of the most surprising things was in 2003, I was very blessed  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:38):**  in that Dr. Chris Nichols came to work at the ARS station Mandan, North Dakota, about 20 miles from  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:44):**  my place. She came out to my place in 2003, saw what I was doing, and she said, Gabe, you've come  
**[0:38:50-0:38:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:50):**  a long way. Your soils have improved significantly, but you will never truly be regenerative until you  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:38:58):**  significantly back off or eliminate the use of synthetics on your operation. So what I did there,  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:04):**  you know, I'm pretty gullible person in that if a person really comes across credible to me,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:12):**  I am going to either try and prove them right or wrong. So after Dr. Nichols was here, for four  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:19):**  years, I did split trials and realized our soils had advanced quite a bit, but I did split trials,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:25):**  different rates of synthetic fertilizer, and then all the way down to zero. And I was amazed at the  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:32):**  production of cash crops I was able to get and cover crops for that matter in the form of biomass,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:38):**  I was able to get without the use of those synthetics. The other thing that really struck  
**[0:39:44-0:39:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:44):**  out to me was on the fields where we were not using the synthetics, the aggregation of the soil  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:52):**  just advanced very, very rapid. We noticed we were building more soil aggregates. Of course,  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:39:57):**  you build more soil aggregates, you can have better water infiltration, you got a home for  
**[0:40:01-0:40:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:01):**  biology, etc. So that really surprised me that I was actually decimating, so to speak, my soils  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:11):**  by the use of all these synthetics. And so I learned an old great deal to Dr. Chris Nichols  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:18):**  for challenging me back then. And our soils took a giant leap forward because we tried those split  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:25):**  trials then for four years. So we haven't used any synthetic fertility, pesticides, or fungicides  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:32):**  since 2007. We still occasionally use a herbicide, but not near as often. So that's one of the things  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:40):**  that really sticks out to me as a major turning point for our operation. That is quite incredible.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:46):**  And I guess just for clarity, one of the questions that I have when you talk about synthetics,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:51):**  particularly synthetic fertilizers, what had been the synthetics that you were using? Are you  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:40:57):**  describing things such as anhydrous ammonia, potassium chloride, or salt?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:03):**  Yeah, yeah, we were not using any anhydrous ammonia. We were not using any liquid forms.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:09):**  It was all dry forms of synthetic fertilizers, so like urea and DAP, etc. That's what we were  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:18):**  using simply because of our equipment was set up for it. But what we really noticed was, for one  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:25):**  thing, we were significantly over applying nitrogen, and of course that was burning through  
**[0:41:30-0:41:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:30):**  the carbon, you know, and then we just, it was destroying aggregation. The other thing was we  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:37):**  were over applying phosphorus, which is done virtually all over the world, you know, we're  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:42):**  over applying the phosphorus, which is having a negative impact on mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:47):**  fungi, of course, free-coals malin, which is critical for the formation of soil particles. So  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:52):**  that's why that combination there is why we noticed such a significant improvement in the  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:41:59):**  aggregation of our soil when we removed. Now, am I sitting here today telling producers,  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:04):**  oh you should all quit using synthetics? No, don't. You're going to have a wreck if you do.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:09):**  You know, our soils are like drug addicts. We got to wean them off of these synthetics over time.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:15):**  The beautiful thing today is we're able to do that, and thanks to tests such as the Haney soil  
**[0:42:21-0:42:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:21):**  test, it gives producers the confidence to really see just how much nutrients they can have in their  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:30):**  soils be converted from organic to inorganic via biology. And so there's huge advancements being  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:36):**  made in soil testing and how nutrients move through the system via biology that we're able to  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:43):**  more confidently do this, show producers, okay, let's start weaning off fully over time and get  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:49):**  the health back into your soils. And that's the one piece that we tell growers in our consulting  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:42:55):**  work is they need to earn the right to both discontinue the use of fertilizers or slow  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:01):**  down the use of fertilizers and also to discontinue the use of fungicides and insecticides. That is,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:07):**  there's tremendous potential to grow plants that are extremely disease and insect resistant,  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:12):**  you kind of have to earn the right to get there and it doesn't happen overnight.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:16):**  That's very well said and very true. Look at the work Dr. Jonathan Longerin, you know,  
**[0:43:22-0:43:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:22):**  the paper was just released where in peer reviewed that regenerative farm and ranch is much much more  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:31):**  profitable while improving their ecosystem as compared to those that are using, in this case,  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:39):**  it was the DATRAID corn genetics. Yeah, exactly. Gabe, what do you believe to be true about modern  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:45):**  agriculture that many other people don't believe to be true? I believe that, look, today when a  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:51):**  producers go out and buy, say, a combine or a tractor or a new pickup, they get an owner's  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:43:56):**  manual, right? They get an owner's manual, you know, you're supposed to read it, etc. We're never  
**[0:44:01-0:44:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:01):**  giving that for soils. When we go out and buy land or rent land, we're not giving an owner's  
**[0:44:08-0:44:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:08):**  manual. Too many producers look at their soils as simply a medium to hold a plant upright. They  
**[0:44:16-0:44:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:16):**  don't realize that soils are a living, dynamic, very resilient ecosystem and they don't realize  
**[0:44:25-0:44:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:25):**  the power of soil life, the power of photosynthesis. I'm often asked by people who come to my place and  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:33):**  when I speak at conferences, what's the one thing you do on your operation that sets you apart from  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:39):**  your neighbor? And I tell them I have a living, growing root in the ground as long as possible  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:46):**  throughout here. It just, you know, and you've done the same thing, John, you travel to these  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:51):**  conferences and workshops to speak and you drive for hundreds of miles. Well, let me give you this  
**[0:44:57-0:45:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:44:57):**  example. In October, I had to drive 652 miles to speak in western Montana. This was in October.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:06):**  How many green growing crops did I see in October from Bismarck, North Dakota to Butte, Montana?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:13):**  Once I left my place, the answer was one. I saw one field that had a green growing crop on it that  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:19):**  was taking CO2 out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis, making all these carbons and  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:25):**  molecules and pumping that into, it wasn't making carbon molecules, but it was converting it to  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:30):**  liquid carbon, pumping it into the soil. We as producers do not realize the power of the natural  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:38):**  system. And if we would just give nature half a chance, she's very resilient and we could heal our  
**[0:45:44-0:45:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:44):**  soils, put more dollars in our pocket, plus produce a more nutrient dense food, you know, and that's  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:51):**  what frustrates me is just too many producers have blinders on, they think it's all about  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:45:56):**  federal farm programs. And I get a kick on what's happening at the current moment as we're  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:01):**  recording this podcast, you know, there's this quote unquote, tariff war going on with China,  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:07):**  I just laugh because that'll have absolutely no bearing on Gabe Brown and his operation, because  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:13):**  we made ourselves resilient to that because of what we've done to heal the ecosystem. You know,  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:19):**  producers don't realize that just how much of their profitability revolves around this living  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:27):**  dynamic ecosystem and that they can heal it if they give nature half a chance. That is the one  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:33):**  piece that I'm so excited about, and I speak a lot about at conferences is harnessing the power  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:40):**  of the photosynthetic engine, having living growing plants is really the only way that you  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:45):**  have of bringing new energy into the system and bringing new energy to a soil profile. And it's  
**[0:46:51-0:46:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:51):**  such, it's so incredibly powerful. We don't even know, most growers don't even know and have  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:46:58):**  they have never had the opportunity to observe truly healthy plants that are photosynthesizing  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:04):**  at max capacity. And if we can just harness that photosynthetic engine and tap into that,  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:09):**  that has such incredible possibilities for regenerating soil health and producing extraordinary  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:15):**  crops is tremendous untapped potential there for everyone. You're absolutely right, John. You hit  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:20):**  the nail on the head there. Ray Archuleta always poses the question when he presents to groups,  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:27):**  is your farmer ranch being run on ancient sunlight or new sunlight? Are you one that's using  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:33):**  high amounts of carbon in the form of fossil fuels? Are you harvesting energy with growing plants?  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:39):**  And like Ray always says, if we could just get producers to cover their fields and grow things  
**[0:47:44-0:47:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:44):**  and then significantly back off on the tillage aspect so that carbon can cycle through rather  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:50):**  than being released from a tillage past, we could take care of a lot of the issues that we're seeing  
**[0:47:55-0:48:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:47:55):**  in production agriculture today. This isn't rocket science. It's been done for eons of time. And when  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:02):**  you talk, John, about the carbon, you know, the potential and the energy being brought in through  
**[0:48:07-0:48:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:07):**  photosynthesis, then the livestock come into play because when a livestock grazes one of these cover  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:14):**  crops, a living plant, that plant then is going to start pumping more carbon into the soil,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:19):**  thus improving the carbon cycle even more. So that's where livestock integration can  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:24):**  advance soils to another level. Absolutely. What do you think is the biggest opportunity  
**[0:48:29-0:48:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:29):**  in agriculture today? The biggest opportunity I see in production agriculture is going to  
**[0:48:36-0:48:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:36):**  revolve around advancing your soil health to the point where you can truly produce more  
**[0:48:43-0:48:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:43):**  nutrient-dense foods because we're seeing a real trend in, well, it's worldwide, but particularly  
**[0:48:51-0:48:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:51):**  in this country where producers, excuse me, consumers are starting to think of food as  
**[0:48:58-0:49:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:48:58):**  health. You know, look at the amount of medicine, prescription that are being used today. There is  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:05):**  a shift occurring where consumers, you know, it was called pill for ill medicine, you know,  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:12):**  they wanted, doctors were prescribing just pills. I think last statistics I heard, don't quote me  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:18):**  exactly, but it's something like 800 and some prescriptions are being rolled per thousand  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:23):**  individuals in this country. That's absolutely ridiculous. Instead of doing that, consumers are  
**[0:49:28-0:49:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:28):**  starting to realize that food is health and what they eat directly dictates how healthy they are.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:36):**  I had the good fortune of spending a day with Dr. Daphne Miller. Dr. Daphne Miller wrote the book,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:42):**  she's a family practitioner who wrote the book, pharmacology, and she told me she firmly believes  
**[0:49:49-0:49:58](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:49):**  95 approximately percent of illnesses that people have can be cured or prevented just through what  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:49:58):**  they eat. So as a producer out there, why would I not want to take advantage of it? Why would I  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:05):**  not want to offer products that are high in nutrient density and then I'm going to be  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:10):**  rewarded for it? I'm going to charge. Gabe Brown's a capitalist. I make no excuses for what I'm  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:16):**  charging for what I'm producing because I'm the one out there putting my capital on the line every  
**[0:50:21-0:50:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:21):**  year doing these practices that are necessary to ensure that what I'm producing is nutrient dense.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:28):**  Well consumers there have already proven to me they're willing to pay for it and they'll write  
**[0:50:33-0:50:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:33):**  the check for it because they know that it will have a positive impact on their health. So I think  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:39):**  that's the one thing that more producers need to look at and I really think we're going to see that  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:45):**  trend accelerate rapidly in the near future where consumers are going to search out, find the  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:50):**  producers who are producing nutrient dense products under regenerative practices and then  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:50:55):**  they're going to vote with their buying dollar where and who they want to purchase from. Yeah,  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:00):**  I see that happening already as well particularly in the food and vegetable production space and  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:04):**  it's just going to continue to accelerate. I think you're absolutely correct. What is a book  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:09):**  or resource that you recommend most often to growers? Yeah, there's two of them right now that  
**[0:51:14-0:51:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:14):**  I'm really recommending. One is a soil owner's manual by John Stick. John Stick is a retired  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:22):**  NRCS soil health specialist here in North Dakota and he wrote a wonderful, it's a short read,  
**[0:51:28-0:51:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:28):**  very easy read just outlining the principles of soil health and I hand out copies wherever I go  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:36):**  of that book because it's a way that producers can sit down and it's not overwhelming to them  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:43):**  and look at, you know, get the ideas in their mind of what they need to do to regenerate their  
**[0:51:48-0:51:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:48):**  resource. The next book I've been recommending lately here is the one I mentioned earlier,  
**[0:51:54-0:52:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:51:54):**  What's Making Our Children Thick? And I do that kind of as a shock factor because as I said  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:00):**  earlier, I don't think we as producers really realize the impact we're having on society by  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:07):**  what we're doing and producing. And so like I said, I think it's up to all of us to look in the mirror  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:14):**  and realize, you know, what we're doing may not be what's best not only for ourselves but  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:20):**  for society. Yeah, that's awesome to have to actually have a soil owner's manual because that's  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:25):**  what you were describing we need earlier. On that note, I am just going through the editing process  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:31):**  on a book of my own so I'll shamelessly put a plug in here. My book's going to be released in November.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:38):**  It's going to be entitled Dirt Toil and it's just going to be a read on our family's  
**[0:52:43-0:52:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:43):**  journey through the over the past 20 plus years as we've moved into these regenerative practices.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:49):**  It's not going to be a real soil owner's manual type of book, how-to book. It's going to be just  
**[0:52:56-0:53:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:52:56):**  more of the story and then I'm going to use examples of what I learned, you know, through all  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:02):**  the mistakes I've made over the past 20 plus years and give stories about how certain people  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:08):**  influenced my lives and what I took away from that and how I used it to build the  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:15):**  ranch we have today. That's awesome. Dirt To Soil by Gabe Brown. Do you have any idea where it will be  
**[0:53:20-0:53:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:20):**  available? It will be available through Chelsea Green and then we'll have it on our soil health  
**[0:53:24-0:53:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:24):**  consulting website and I'm sure it'll be out on Amazon also. Absolutely. Awesome. What technology  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:31):**  and ideas are you really excited about for the future of that? You know, I tell people if they get  
**[0:53:37-0:53:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:37):**  to know Gabe Brown, Gabe Brown is not a very intelligent person. I have a pretty good sense of observation.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:45):**  I think there might be some debate about that. I appreciate that but I'm really not. I am  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:51):**  observant and I'm able to look at things and I tell producers this. As I said earlier, I'm on  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:53:57):**  hundreds of operations every year all over North America and I love going to people's farms and  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:02):**  ranches. I can always learn something everywhere I go and I think we've lost the power of observation.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:09):**  I think sometimes we look at technology as a cure-all. You know, us as producers, it seems we want  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:16):**  to rest apart. We want to know if we apply this pesticide, this seed treatment and put this  
**[0:54:22-0:54:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:22):**  seed on, back traits at this time and apply these to fertilizers and chemicals, then we can combine  
**[0:54:30-0:54:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:30):**  X amount. Regenerative Ag is all about observation and about understanding what is happening in our  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:37):**  soil and it amazes me and I'm sure John you will agree with this, how many producers  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:44):**  never take a shovel and look at their soil. You know, I will guarantee you I have dug in several  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:50):**  of my neighbors' soils more often than they have. You know, they just never do. They don't think of  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:54:54):**  looking at it. Now you ask what technology is coming about that I'm excited about. There is  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:01):**  leaps and bounds being made in the knowledge of soil biology right now and the instrumentation,  
**[0:55:08-0:55:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:08):**  etc., to analyze just what this biology is doing and you know, Dr. Chris Nichols, who's one of the  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:16):**  world's foremost soil microbiologists, will tell you she used to think she knew one percent of  
**[0:55:22-0:55:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:22):**  what was going on in the soil. Now she realizes she knows one-tenth of one percent. So that  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:27):**  shows you the amount of learning we have yet to do. So I think the technology as far as just  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:34):**  understanding these soil microorganisms, that's one thing I'm excited about. Another one I am  
**[0:55:40-0:55:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:40):**  really excited about from a consumer standpoint is the Bio-Nutrient Food Association is working  
**[0:55:47-0:55:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:47):**  on a instrumentation that consumers will be able to have and they'll be able to go into any  
**[0:55:54-0:56:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:55:54):**  grocery store, farmers market, etc., scan a food item and then the nutrient density of that item  
**[0:56:02-0:56:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:02):**  will be measured and available. And I think that is just going to, they're hoping by 2020 that that  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:10):**  will be available. I think that will be game-changing because consumers, given a choice,  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:16):**  they are going to purchase the higher nutrient dense product if it's within recent price wise.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:21):**  Well, as consumers are more educated about food as health, I think that'll drive real change on the  
**[0:56:28-0:56:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:28):**  landscape too because all of a sudden farmers, you know, boy, their product isn't selling. Well,  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:35):**  it's way lower nutrient density. They better start making changes to their management in order to  
**[0:56:41-0:56:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:41):**  positively affect the oil ecosystem. So I think that's just huge in what's going to be done there.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:47):**  Third thing as far as technology, there's been some real advancements in being able to measure  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:56:54):**  exactly how much carbon we're cycling through our system. I'm working with a group now called  
**[0:57:01-0:57:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:01):**  Landstream and Dr. John Norman who helped develop much of the instrumentation that's being used by  
**[0:57:09-0:57:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:09):**  NASA is a key player in that organization along with Abe Collins. And they're looking at real-time  
**[0:57:18-0:57:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:18):**  data, how much carbon, sunlight is being collected over the landscape and then they're going to be  
**[0:57:24-0:57:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:24):**  able to project out growth of plants biomass and it'll really help grazers. They'll be able to  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:30):**  predict how much forage they'll have available at any given time. And then it'll be able to  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:36):**  help grain producers look at, okay, how much carbon cycling in the system, how much growth  
**[0:57:42-0:57:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:42):**  will they get out of these plants, how much production, et cetera. So there's some pretty  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:46):**  exciting things that are in the work. Gabe, throughout this conversation, you've mentioned  
**[0:57:51-0:57:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:51):**  so many different ideas that farmers should consider, things that they should consider  
**[0:57:56-0:58:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:57:56):**  looking at and possibly working on. There's almost the opportunity for a bit of confusion  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:01):**  for people who are just asking the question, well, where do I begin and where do I start?  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:06):**  What are the first actions that you would recommend the growers to take?  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:10):**  Yeah, and then that's a great question and you're absolutely right. A lot of times people are just  
**[0:58:16-0:58:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:16):**  overwhelmed by it. Well, it all comes back to the five principles and what can they do on their  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:22):**  operation? First thing I tell producers is they need to educate themselves. With internet  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:27):**  technology today, it's very easy to educate yourself through YouTube videos and through  
**[0:58:34-0:58:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:34):**  Audible, through books as you're in the tractor. Look at that as school and learn something.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:38):**  One of the things that I'm fortunate is just I have this desire to learn as much as I can.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:53](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:46):**  So I try, I read on the average two books a week and listen to more than that. I just can't  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:53):**  get enough information. So I encourage producers to learn and then apply the five principles. I  
**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:58:59):**  tell them, take one field, whatever will allow you to sleep at night, whether it be five acres or I  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:05):**  had one producer who took 8,000 acres first year and moved into regenerative practice. Whatever  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:10):**  allows you to sleep at night, commit yourself that field for five years and say for five years,  
**[0:59:16-0:59:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:16):**  I'm going to try these principles. And then those principles are simply least amount of mechanical  
**[0:59:21-0:59:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:21):**  or chemical disturbance possible, armor on the soil surface. So we don't want bare soil. That's  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:27):**  not, you know, nothing growing. We're not collecting sunlight. Third principle, of course,  
**[0:59:31-0:59:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:31):**  is diversity. You know, we need diversity. These ecosystems were very, very diverse. I always tell  
**[0:59:38-0:59:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:38):**  the story about how my son taught rangeland management at the local community college for  
**[0:59:42-0:59:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:42):**  five years. He brought his students out to one of our quote unquote native pastures. And in two  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:48):**  hour timeframe, they collected over 140 different species of grasses, forbs and leggings. That's  
**[0:59:54-0:59:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:54):**  diversity. Now, what are we doing today? Oh, we plant corn and beans. Okay. Now, which is going  
**[0:59:59-1:00:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=0:59:59):**  to be a healthier soil ecosystem. Fourth principle, we talked about this earlier, living in the ground  
**[1:00:04-1:00:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:04):**  as long as possible throughout the year, collecting sunlight. That's what it's about. Fifth principle,  
**[1:00:09-1:00:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:09):**  animal integration. And I would add insects on there, although insects are animals because  
**[1:00:13-1:00:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:13):**  we don't realize the benefit that insects provide to the ecosystem. So have a producer try these  
**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:21):**  five principles on a given field for five years. I've never had anyone go all five years and then  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:28):**  go back to the old way they were doing things. I've had them drop out after a year or two because  
**[1:00:33-1:00:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:33):**  they just didn't have the will and fortitude to stick with it. But I've never had them go all five  
**[1:00:37-1:00:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:37):**  years. Usually by year three, they're changing their entire operational, you know. And there's  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:43):**  one other thing, one other advancement, John, I just want to mention briefly here that I think  
**[1:00:48-1:00:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:48):**  is really important is we need to get perennials back into our systems in one way or another. For  
**[1:00:54-1:01:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:00:54):**  those who live a bit further south than you or I, I see that as being more of a what Colin Sice  
**[1:01:04-1:01:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:04):**  in Australia terms no kill cropping, where you have a perennial growing at all times, and then  
**[1:01:11-1:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:11):**  you're actually no tilling your cash crop into that. It's being done successfully in Kansas,  
**[1:01:17-1:01:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:17):**  producers such as Che New are doing this now, where he has perennial growing paddocks and then  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:24):**  he's no tilling and they are cool season, he's no tilling warm season species in there such as  
**[1:01:31-1:01:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:31):**  grain sorghum, etc. That is just key because you have that living root at all the time in the soil  
**[1:01:37-1:01:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:37):**  and then as that cool season shuts down, you seed the warm season cash crop best of both worlds.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:43):**  I've had the good fortune of being over on Colin Sice's place in Australia several times and to me  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:49):**  that's the ultimate cropping system right there. That sounds like next generation for certain.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:01:55):**  What is the one question you wish I would have asked? You did a good job, John. I think  
**[1:02:00-1:02:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:00):**  you covered most of the basis. You know, it is, I understand it's a bit overwhelming  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:07):**  to many producers, but I tell them just try something, just do something, grow something,  
**[1:02:13-1:02:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:13):**  you know, and don't think they have to do it all. I tell everybody I don't want everybody doing all  
**[1:02:21-1:02:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:21):**  the things Gabe Brown is doing. We all have our own desires, our own goals, different landscapes,  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:29):**  different conditions. You need to do what makes you happy, you know, but the other thing is don't  
**[1:02:35-1:02:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:35):**  ever complain to me that there's not money in production agriculture, you know. One thing that  
**[1:02:40-1:02:47](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:40):**  I really, really get tired of is when I travel all over, I often ask the question, how many of you  
**[1:02:47-1:02:52](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:47):**  want your sons or daughters to come back to join the operation? Most people raise their hand and  
**[1:02:52-1:02:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:52):**  then I ask, well, how many of them are? Very few will and I think that's just sad that we have an  
**[1:02:59-1:03:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:02:59):**  industry where we're actually driving young people away rather than inviting them in and, you know,  
**[1:03:06-1:03:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:06):**  those of you who know my operation know that my wife and I have two children and our 30-year-old  
**[1:03:11-1:03:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:11):**  son is a partner in the operation. I knew from a young age our son wanted to come back, but I made  
**[1:03:17-1:03:24](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:17):**  it conducive for him to come. He knew before he even got out of college that this operation would  
**[1:03:24-1:03:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:24):**  be his and it wasn't because we were just handing it to him, it was because he deserved it and we  
**[1:03:30-1:03:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:30):**  were inviting him back and we allowed him from the get-go to make management decisions. You have to  
**[1:03:36-1:03:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:36):**  make it conducive for these young people and desirable for them, you know. It's pretty, you  
**[1:03:41-1:03:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:41):**  know, what young person wants to come back from college when mom and dad are struggling all the  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:46):**  time and don't know where the next dollar comes from and, you know, that just doesn't make sense.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:51):**  We have to change our mindset and make it conducive for the next generation.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:03:56):**  Absolutely, and that and the economic piece is a big part of that and also I think when you talk  
**[1:04:01-1:04:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:01):**  about creating a conducive environment, being able to make management decisions and being able to  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:07):**  identify something as your own. If you are going to continue working for your parents and they're  
**[1:04:13-1:04:18](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:13):**  going to keep managing and running the farm for the next 40 years until they're 70 years old and  
**[1:04:18-1:04:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:18):**  you're 50, that is not appealing. You're exactly right, John.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:29](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:22):**  Gabe, this has been a fascinating interview. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm very honored that  
**[1:04:29-1:04:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:29):**  you were able to share your thoughts here on the podcast and I will look forward to having you back  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:34):**  at some point in the future. Thank you very much. That's great, John. My pleasure. Nice visiting  
**[1:04:39-1:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:39):**  with you. This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for, Advancing  
**[1:04:43-1:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:43):**  Eco-Agriculture, the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AA, we believe in  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:50):**  challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops. We also  
**[1:04:55-1:05:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:04:55):**  believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow healthy plants,  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/social-impacts-of-regenerative-agriculture-with-gabe-brown/#t=1:05:01):**  we must first think differently about agriculture, about empowering life instead of suppressing life,

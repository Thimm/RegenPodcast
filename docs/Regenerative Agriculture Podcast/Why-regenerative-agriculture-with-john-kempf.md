### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 16:05:21)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, I'm Jon Kempf hosting this podcast. I am passionate about developing regenerative  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:06):**  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:11):**  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:16):**  conversation about growing food as medicine. I've discovered that there are many people with  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:22):**  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:28):**  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:33):**  It's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:38):**  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:42):**  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:49):**  bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion and incorporate it into products and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:00:55):**  growing systems that growers can easily put into practice. It's my personal mission to have these  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:00):**  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:05):**  quo against which all other growing systems are compared. To help achieve this goal, I want to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:12):**  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:17):**  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:22):**  systems and make them easier for growers to apply, this knowledge and these principles can be applied  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:27):**  anywhere. And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability and  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:01:33):**  resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,

**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:08):**  I've received a lot of emails from many of you, which I have greatly appreciated and it's really  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:14):**  rewarding to hear from you and hear about the work that you're doing and how the information is able  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:20):**  to help. One of the things that many of you have asked for is for me to share some of my own  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:25):**  thoughts and observations on what I'm seeing happening in the agriculture space and some of  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:30):**  the progress that we're observing on farms that we're working with, new things that we're learning  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:33):**  and so forth. As a result of that feedback from you, we are in addition to hosting a weekly guest  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:41):**  for an in-depth interview. I'm also going to begin posting a weekly episode just with a very brief 10  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:49):**  or 15 minute topic of something that I've been thinking about that I believe is important for us  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:02:54):**  to discuss and to have a bigger discussion around. The topic for today, I want to speak a little bit  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:00):**  about why regenerative agriculture is important and how regenerative agriculture is different  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:08):**  from some of the more standard terminology that is being used. Over the last 10 or 12 years,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:15):**  there's been a lot of conversation about developing sustainable agriculture and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:21):**  sustainable agriculture has evolved to become different things for different people. But I  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:27):**  have to ask the question, what is it that we are seeking to sustain? From my perspective, we should  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:33):**  have no desire to sustain the level of agricultural productivity and performance that we are at today.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:40):**  Our soils have become too degraded. We have lost a lot of soil organic matter. We've lost a lot of  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:44):**  soil fertility. Our water has become polluted. Our ecological ecosystems are becoming depressed  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:51):**  because of agricultural impacts on the ecosystem. We should have no desire to sustain where we are  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:03:56):**  right now. We first need to have a conversation about regenerating agriculture ecosystems.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:02):**  And also the ecology that surrounds those agriculture ecosystems. When we implement and  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:08):**  develop regenerative farming systems, that means that we are regenerating soil health and building  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:14):**  organic matter. Regenerative farming systems means that we are maintaining, actually I would contend  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:20):**  that we need to be increasing yields. Regenerative farming systems have the capacity to increase  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:25):**  yields substantially without using mined or synthetic fertilizers. And I know that for some  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:32):**  that may sound to be a really big mouthful. And yet this is being done successfully. It's being  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:37):**  done successfully on a scale of thousands of acres with many different types of crops in many  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:43):**  different regions and climatic conditions. So the argument no longer holds valid that it can't be  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:50):**  done because it is being done. It is being implemented and applied successfully. And it is  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:04:55):**  possible for us to increase yields without using applied synthetic fertilizers. Developing  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:02):**  regenerative agriculture ecosystems also means that we are developing disease suppressive soils.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:08):**  And along at the same time as we're developing disease suppressive soils, we're growing plants  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:14):**  that have a functional immune system that are really greatly resistant to disease and insect  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:21):**  pests and substantially reducing or in many cases I would suggest even completely eliminating the  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:28):**  need for pesticide applications. Once we have achieved all of these various pieces, building  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:34):**  soil organic matter, increasing soil health, increasing yields without applications of synthetic  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:40):**  fertilizers, reducing or eliminating the need for pesticides, developing disease suppressive soil.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:45):**  Once we have achieved all of those various pieces, at that point we have achieved a much higher  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:51):**  plateau of performance. And once we've achieved that point and only at that point can we have a  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:05:57):**  conversation about true sustainability. We cannot be sustainable as long as we are constantly  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:03):**  importing large quantities of inputs into the farm. We should not have any desire to sustain  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:09):**  the agricultural models that we are using today. We can do so much better. We have the knowledge  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:14):**  and we have the information how to deploy these regenerative agriculture ecosystems. And the only  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:20):**  thing that we need to do is actually implement the knowledge that is already out there and that  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:25):**  already exists. So this has been one of the purposes for this podcast is to share this  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:31):**  knowledge, to share the information that many people have and to make it readily available.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:36):**  There are many people who have many growers, many farmers, many consultants and advisors who have  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:42):**  incredible knowledge. I've been very fortunate to meet with some exceptional people but I am certain  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:49):**  that there are also very many more that I do not know. And so I would ask you if you have any  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:06:54):**  suggestions or recommendations for people who have valuable information and stories to share  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:00):**  that are not widely known, I would love to hear from you and would love to be able to give them  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:04):**  a platform with which to share their knowledge and information with the world. So thank you very  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:10):**  much for listening to the podcast, for sharing and actually implementing the information that  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:15):**  you learn because as we work together and learn together we're going to be able to have a  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:21):**  tremendous impact on the quality of food that is being grown in the world and being able to  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:28):**  have a tremendous impact also on the quality of our environment and the ecology. Thank you very  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:33):**  much for the work that you're doing and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Be well.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:37):**  This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:40):**  AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture, the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:46):**  At AEA we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative ways to  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:51):**  grow crops. We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:07:56):**  grow healthy plants we must first think different about agriculture, about empowering life instead  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:01):**  of suppressing life, about regeneration versus degeneration. To achieve this we formulate and  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:07):**  sell products that help growers produce higher quality yield with less risk of crop failure.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:32](https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/why-regenerative-agriculture-with-john-kempf/#t=0:08:12):**  In short we help growers make more money with less risk. Thank you for listening.

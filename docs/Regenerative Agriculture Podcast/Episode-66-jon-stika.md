### Regenerative Agriculture Podcast  (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:20:39)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is Jon and welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture podcast where we talk  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:05):**  about the agronomic science and the cultural management practices that regenerate plant health  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:12):**  and soil health and ultimately of course livestock health and our own health as well and the health  
**[0:00:18-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:18):**  of the entire ecosystems. I'm very pleased for this episode to have as a guest Jon Stieka from  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  North Dakota. Jon has authored this very interesting little book that is titled  
**[0:00:33-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  A Soil Owner's Manual and it is very seldom that I've read a book that contains as much information  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  in as few paragraphs as this one does. It's something that I really highly recommend to all  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:47):**  of you to take a look at and we'll link to it in the show notes and when we put it out there.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  So with that introduction Jon can you tell us a little bit about your background and history and  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  story and what has brought you here and what led to the book and to the work that you engaged in?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:02):**  Well I currently live in North Dakota and gained a lot of experience here. I'm originally from  
**[0:01:08-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  Wisconsin. I grew up on a dairy operation and questioned a lot of things back then about the  
**[0:01:17-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  way that we did things in the field, the way we grew our crops. It was in 1992 as an employee  
**[0:01:25-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  with Natural Resources Conservation Service that I was presented with a soil quality test kit  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  and at that time I was working as an agronomist and none of the soil scientists were really  
**[0:01:43-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  interested in the soil quality test kit because it didn't relate to soil classification which was  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  primarily what soil scientists with NRCS were involved with. So I said well I'd be interested  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  in looking at it and I began to look at it and it made me start to think about how the soil  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  functions because we never really talked about that. We talked about how to classify it, how to  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:13):**  test it chemically, all of these things but we never really looked at well how does it function,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  how is it supposed to function. So that led me on the path of exploring that and in 1992  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  I actually gave a presentation to a group of producers here in North Dakota talking about  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:35):**  soil quality which we now refer to as soil health and I explained to them how destructive tillage  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  was and I only got to about my second slide in my presentation and the rest of it just  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  turned into a big discussion which was very good. But then we went through a period here  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  in western North Dakota where we were primarily looking at controlling wind erosion and so we  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  started looking at no-till as a way to do that and no-till progressed from controlling wind  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  erosion to conserving moisture to improving soil health and we started to talk to more soil  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  biologists and plant physiologists and began to realize that we're actually restoring the soil.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  This is actually taking us on a path that's restoring what's been degraded  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:30):**  and then I taught a soil health training with NRCS across the country for a number of years  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:37):**  before I retired in 2015 and since then I've been involved writing my book talking to groups that  
**[0:03:46-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  are interested in soil health to stay in the stay in the loop on it and I also haven't tilled my  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  garden or applied any fertilizer to my garden for probably close to two decades now just so I could  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  see for myself and learn for myself from my own garden.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  I'm really interested in your perspective on the question of how our soil is supposed to function  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  and where you started with that first presentation back in 1992. For the last decade or more I've  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  been talking about how we should consider soil function from the perspective of biology  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  and we have been perhaps blinded in our perspective by using primarily chemistry-based analysis and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  just taking a very chemistry-based approach. I'd love to get your perspective. How did this start  
**[0:04:40-0:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  for you in 1992 and how is soil supposed to function? Well I guess the big epiphany for me  
**[0:04:48-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  was that it is a biological system and looking at aggregate stability and how aggregates are formed  
**[0:04:59-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:59):**  was kind of one of the starting points but as I was exposed to various soil biologists,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  Taycon Cesar who is a retired soil mycologist, Christine Nichols, Jill Clappert, Elaine Ingham,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  all those folks that told me very matter-of-factly how the biology and the soil  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  drove the majority of what we expect the soil to do as producers.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  And it was at that point that I thought okay I have to throw away almost everything I've learned  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  about agronomy because this is a biological system and that's a whole different perspective,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:51):**  that's a whole different understanding in how we approach this. I think that's a key realization  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:57):**  that is often missed when we really appreciate the impact of biology. I think it has been the case  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:05):**  that many agronomists who've approached this biological approach or this regenerative approach  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  to soil health want to continue working with what they learned in agronomy. They want to continue  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  working with balancing soil nutrients and so forth. There's not enough of a solution to this  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  and so forth. There's not enough appreciation that in many cases that may become largely or  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  completely irrelevant. Well there's always been an acknowledgement that there's certain bacteria  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  in the soil that run part of the nitrogen cycle but that was it. You know that was it was just  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:49):**  tip of the hat to yeah there's a few bacteria that play a role in the nitrogen cycle and then  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  the discussion and the thought process would go right back to chemistry again. And as I've learned  
**[0:07:04-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  it's the biology that cause all of these changes in the soil to happen that cause the nutrients  
**[0:07:14-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  to be available to the plants. Not just that this chemistry is present but how do the plants  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  actually associate with the biology to get what they need. That's a whole different ball game.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  It's not just plant roots lapping up nitrate nitrogen that happens to be laying right next to  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  them which is you know what a lot of agronomy had been based on. And it was very wasteful and very  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:44):**  disruptive and but understanding things like rhizophage and all these other ways that  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  mycorrhizal fungi etc work with plants is a whole different paradigm.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  At the time your book was published you offered a very neat and very concise summary and overview of  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:08):**  kind of the science that was available up to that point. I'd love for you to expand just a little  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  bit on fertilizer efficiency let's say nitrogen for example or phosphorus applications. What  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  really happens to soil biology when we put on these synthetic fertilizer applications  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  and how does that influence the capacity of the soil to regenerate? Well by applying these  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  nutrients in the forms that we've been applying them I think we basically sideline  
**[0:08:42-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  a lot of the soil biology. They get shoved to the side or ignored because the plant has this excess  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  of nutrients that's right there available. And even though it's terribly inefficient  
**[0:08:59-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:59):**  it still is the easiest path at that time for the plant to absorb some of those nutrients.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:09):**  But that lasts for such a short period of time that the plant then misses the opportunity  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  to create these relationships with the soil biology. So when that quick flush of chemical  
**[0:09:25-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  fertilizer is gone it's now left with having to spend a lot of energy and time to create these  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  associations and begin to be able to acquire nutrients in the form that it really needs.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  And if we're talking an annual plant we start running out of time. You know this plant is always  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  going to be behind trying to make all of that happen in a short growing season. When you were  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  speaking about the absorption of this flush of available nutrients from fertilizer applications  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  you mentioned that even though this is an energy inefficient they still do that because it is the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:09):**  most available form. Can you expand on that a little bit? What does it mean to be energy  
**[0:10:14-0:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:14):**  inefficient? How are these fertilizers inefficient for plants to absorb? The forms of nutrients that  
**[0:10:24-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:24):**  soil biology can pre-package so to speak for the plants saves the plant having to spend its own  
**[0:10:35-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  energy to get those nutrients from a very simple form to a higher form. So the plant can pick up  
**[0:10:47-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  that very simple form like nitrate nitrogen but then it has to do all of this work to move it  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  along the line up into amino acids proteins etc that the soil biology will do a lot of that  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  for the plant ahead of time will prepare those things for the plant ahead of time to save the  
**[0:11:08-0:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:08):**  plant the energy that it would take to make that happen in the plant. As you've been assembling all  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:17):**  of these different pieces and and putting this nice little booklet together what did you discover  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:24):**  that surprised you? What was unexpected on this journey that you've been through? Well,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  that myself and a lot of others in the world of soil science and agronomy were ignorant  
**[0:11:38-0:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  to a lot of these things. I received a bachelor's degree in soil science. I worked as a conservationist  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:48):**  and agronomist for several years and didn't know a lot of this and that's what I did.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  And that really surprised me and shocked me and I could see it was going to be an uphill battle  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  trying to get other people on board trying to get other people to look at this because  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:11):**  we were so ignorant of all of these things for so long up to that point. How has that shifted over  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  the years? You started down this pathway now almost 20 years ago and I understand you retired five  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  years ago or six years ago but is that still the case within academia and within the USDA and NRCS  
**[0:12:32-0:12:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  and so forth that many people are unaware? There's a lot more people aware now than there were 20  
**[0:12:40-0:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:40):**  years ago and I think there's a lot more people that are aware but not understanding, not taking  
**[0:12:53-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:53):**  it seriously. The progression of going from understanding to realization and actually  
**[0:13:01-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  applying this and I think a lot of it is we have too much invested in the field of science and  
**[0:13:09-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  invested in the chemical approach to managing soil that for someone who spent a career developing  
**[0:13:24-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  soil test recommendations based on chemical sampling and analysis to suddenly say yeah I  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  guess that was all wrong and I need to start looking at this from a biological perspective  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  would and is very difficult. We have a lot of industry that's built around that and that  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:48):**  industry funds a lot of research, it funds a lot of things, there's a lot of money involved  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  and so it's very difficult to discard that, to move away from that, at least move away from it  
**[0:14:03-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:03):**  quickly but as producers begin to understand how to manage soil as a biological system  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  and head in that direction and that's what they're willing to spend their money on, I think that will  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  move things in that direction but it's not going to happen overnight.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  You have a unique perspective in that you have some history of observing  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  this transition over time over the last 20 years. What is a reasonable expectation for growers  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  during this transition process? I'm reminded of this quote from Charlie Walters who used to say  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  that people leave their senses as a group and they come to their senses one at a time and so for us  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:51):**  as growers as we come to our senses one at a time and we want to begin managing our soils differently  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  how rapidly should we expect to be able to regenerate soil health and fully embrace a  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:05):**  biological rather than a chemical perspective? I think the regeneration when we made the  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  transition to no-till we could see some pretty significant things, positive things happening in  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  the soil in about three years. By the time we got to six years we could see some very significant  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:27):**  changes and that's in the climate in western North Dakota. In other parts of the world I think that  
**[0:15:34-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  can happen faster in drier more brittle climates it might take a little longer but it's not  
**[0:15:42-0:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  something that takes a hundred years it's something that's very doable in an individual's  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:52):**  lifetime. It took us about 15 years here in western North Dakota to make the transition  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:59):**  away from tilled fallow and tilled cropping systems to no-till systems and now we have  
**[0:16:07-0:16:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  a generation of farmers that are in their 30s early 40s that if you mentioned tillage to them  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:15):**  they would give you a puzzled look and ask well why would I want to do that?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:21):**  All that's going to do is cause a bunch of weeds and you know a lot of other bad things.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:26):**  You know why would I want to do that? So how quickly the soil can change can be a matter of  
**[0:16:34-0:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  a few years or less than a decade for people to get on board and really understand and do that  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  maybe 15 to 20 years and economics is really the driver. We had producers here that were doing  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  about a third fallow and so they would only crop two-thirds of their land every year.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  Once they went to no-till and conserved moisture realized we can crop this land every year.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  We're conserving enough water. Our aggregate stability is improving. Our water infiltration  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  is improving. We can crop this land every year. Well once they realized that the economics of  
**[0:17:15-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:15):**  that was was huge and so it didn't take long for others to realize that also and move in that  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  direction. I think it's worth noting that the perspective you describe is a very different  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:30):**  perspective from the perhaps the pedological view of that it takes centuries or millennia to build  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  topsoil and this has been a common refrain from guests I've had here on the podcast that in fact  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  it doesn't take that much time to build topsoil or to regenerate topsoil. Do you have any additional  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  perspectives on the differences between building soil from the foundational bedrock versus the  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  activity that we're engaged in today of regenerating soil? If you look at the poster that  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  NRCS put out several years ago that says it takes 500 years to form an inch of soil  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  and I looked at that as a soil scientist and I said well it does take a long time for a soil  
**[0:18:15-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  to develop in raw parent material. You have glacial till or you have lacustrine material  
**[0:18:24-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  whatever that is then colonized by plants. It takes a long time for a soil profile to develop  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  but it doesn't take that long to restore a soil that already formed. It has just been degraded.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  The soil is already formed we just degraded it now we can restore that we can overcome that  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:51):**  we can regenerate that in a much shorter period of time than it took for the soil to actually form.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:56):**  I think that's a key and important distinction that is often lost or not not really realized.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:02):**  As you've been on this pathway of looking at all of the science and developing a different  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:07):**  perspective on soil systems what has been something that you've found very rewarding or  
**[0:19:12-0:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  very exciting personally? To see the lights come on in people's eyes as we talk about some of these  
**[0:19:20-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:20):**  things and see them become students of soil health soil biology and head down that path and begin to  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  do their own experimentation and so on and so forth. That first soil health presentation I gave  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:39):**  back in 1992 it was a group of maybe 40 people. And I think that's a really important point to  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:47):**  a group of maybe 40 people so a couple dozen farmers and their spouses.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  And by the time that whole discussion was over I think most of the men were a little disgruntled  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:02):**  with me because I was saying that what they had been doing for the last hundred years was not a  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:08):**  good thing for the soil. So afterwards we had some coffee some cookies whatever afterwards  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:16):**  it was the the wives that came up to me and said you're right the soil is a living thing  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:24):**  we have to take care of it. This isn't just something we can beat up and throw chemicals at  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  and pull yield off of. You're right this is a living thing and so that was encouraging  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  that they saw that they understood that right away but it takes time for people to realize that.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  You just mentioned an important observation that is something that's really I've really come to  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:50):**  appreciate and value and that is the the engagement of the ladies in agriculture as well and in this  
**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:58):**  process. And I've observed distinct differences in engagement and energy when we have a lot of  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:06):**  conversations and we have conferences where the ladies come along as well and don't just come  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  along but actually actively participate. And I think we would do well in the agriculture space  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:18):**  to actively encourage that and invite that further engagement rather than I've been to entirely too  
**[0:21:24-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  many conferences where the audience is 90 or 95 percent men and it's the ladies have a different  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  perspective that is really needed because agriculture over the last however many decades  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  has really adopted an ethos of domination if you will of subjugation and bringing agriculture  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  bringing these natural ecosystems into our subjugation and this is a very different ethos  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  than the more feminine perspective of nurturing and supporting and caring for.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  And if you listen to a lot of what is said in modern agronomy you hear the word control  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:07):**  over and over again. Weed control, insect control, pest control, nutrient management, you know  
**[0:22:14-0:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  everything is controlled and managed to our liking for our outcome which is usually measured by yield  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:23):**  which is usually a pretty poor metric to measure any kind of success in agriculture but  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  yeah it's once people understand this is a biological system this is like like raising  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  an animal you have to care for it you have to provide for it if you expect it to grow  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  if you expect it to become viable and productive and and profitable.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  Jon with the different perspectives you have developed over the years what is something that  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:56):**  you believe to be true about mainstream agriculture or I should just say about  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:00):**  agriculture that is different from the mainstream view? I think getting back to that the soil is a  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  biological system. Jon when we look at this different approach to agronomy and the way that  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  agriculture is evolving in general with interest in different markets and so forth different  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  products different types of products where do you see opportunities for growers in agriculture today?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:26):**  I see one of the things that even the producers that have been on this path for a while  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  still need to improve on is the diversity of the plants that they're growing so I see a lot  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  of opportunity with growing a greater variety of crops that diversify their operations which  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:50):**  is a little more work takes a little more management but that diversity also stabilizes  
**[0:23:57-0:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  their income. Jon when you think about the different areas of opportunity that growers have  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:05):**  to diversify and to look at crop diversity there's this question that comes up or this challenge that  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  comes up in the context of cover crop diversity and the argument that having a diversity of cover

**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  folks who have a more mainstream view if you will. Have you observed any science or research  
**[0:24:30-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  on this topic that offers a different perspective? Not specifically there's some work that's being  
**[0:24:38-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  done at ARS in Mandan North Dakota there's some that we've been doing here in Dickinson with a  
**[0:24:47-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  cropping and grazing study but there hasn't been any real specific testing or examination of  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:57):**  how is it affecting soil biology other than more nitrogen availability and better water  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  infiltration. Well you say other than those are both two very significant pieces. Yes they are  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  and the study that we're doing here at Dickinson we've measured water infiltration that has changed  
**[0:25:20-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  from a fraction of an inch an hour up to about eight inches per hour and our conventional  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:31):**  soil testing does not show the need for nitrogen fertilizer anymore so we're not applying  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:39):**  fertilizer anymore on those studies and that's a study that includes  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:45):**  several crops in rotation along with a couple different multi-species cover crops that are then  
**[0:25:52-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  grazed so it's a very diverse no-till system. Tell us a little bit more about this how much  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:03):**  nitrogen is being generated in this if you're not applying any nitrogen anymore what types of  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  yields are you producing and if what types of crops are you producing? Well I think the  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  question is what types of yields are you producing and if what types of crops? There's wheat, sunflowers,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:19):**  corn, peas in that rotation and I don't have all that data in front of me but a certain  
**[0:26:30-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:30):**  part of the production in that system is measured in pounds of beef in these these steers that are  
**[0:26:41-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  on this that you know that are weighed going in and coming out so there's not the wheat yields  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  and the sunflower yields are those are harvested conventionally and those yields have been very  
**[0:26:59-0:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:59):**  comparable to yields in the area surrounding them in in the county in Dunn County but some of the  
**[0:27:08-0:27:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  yield is measured by pounds of beef in the livestock that are coming off of that system.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  Yeah it's been our observation and the observation of many growers we have worked with that as soil  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:22):**  biology develops they can supply 100% of a crop's nutritional requirements and of course this is  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:29):**  as you've described looking at rotations and looking at incorporating livestock into the  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  landscape that's one way not just reducing input costs but it's easy to talk about nitrogen and  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  nitrogen by itself is not such a significant input for many farms but there's much more that comes  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  with that you also regenerate the soil's capacity to deliver phosphorus and to deliver potassium  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  and a whole bunch of other nutrients that you need to buy less of those as well. Right and in a lot  
**[0:27:56-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  of our systems in our no-till systems we've documented reducing nitrogen in cutting nitrogen  
**[0:28:07-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  in half cutting fuel in half and North Dakota State University in their fertilizer their soil  
**[0:28:16-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  testing recommendations include a 50 pound per acre per year nitrogen credit if the land has been no  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  tilled for at least five years so they're recognizing that there's at least a 50 pound  
**[0:28:35-0:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:35):**  increase in nutrient availability from a soil that's not disturbed with tillage for at least  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:44):**  five years they don't have that tied necessarily directly to biology you know they'll acknowledge  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:53):**  that that's probably where it's coming from or that's probably why it's happening so that's  
**[0:28:57-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  significant just in and of itself that without the soil disturbance the biology can respond.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:07):**  When you think about all these various improvements the improvements in soil health  
**[0:29:12-0:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:12):**  and the improvements in profitability and the economic drivers that you described from being  
**[0:29:20-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:20):**  able to crop soils more consistently and more often it is interesting to contemplate why these  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  production models have not become mainstream much more quickly from your perspective what would have  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:36):**  to happen or what would have to be true for these production practices to be more widely adopted?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  Well and relating back to this this big paradigm shift we went through from tilled systems to  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  no-till systems we had to work our way through getting everyone educated and getting everyone  
**[0:29:58-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  on board we had to work with absentee landowners there were people that owned land but were retired  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  from farming lived out of state lived elsewhere and rented their land out and we had to educate  
**[0:30:16-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:16):**  them on how stopping tillage would regenerate their soil and not degrade their soil so that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  they would communicate that to their renters and say you need to do this in order to regenerate  
**[0:30:38-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  my soil not allow it to continue to degrade. Then we also had to work with lenders because  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  the bankers were very skeptical of moving away from a system that had been proven for many years  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  this fallow system and tillage we had to educate them so they would be willing to lend these  
**[0:31:00-0:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:00):**  producers the money to buy different equipment and take a little bit more risk up front to make  
**[0:31:09-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:09):**  this transition. So everyone needs to be involved the producers the landowners the lenders and then  
**[0:31:18-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  obviously the you know extension and agronomists and and others all need to understand how this  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  works and that managing the soil the way it was designed to function as a biological system is  
**[0:31:35-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:35):**  the lowest risk way to to farm to produce. As you went through this process of trying to bring all  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  these different stakeholders on board and and developing a different perspective what were the  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  roadblocks that you encountered what were the where were the barriers to resi and the significant  
**[0:31:56-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  resistance? Initially it's a very it's a very delicate thing to tell someone to explain to  
**[0:32:08-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  someone that your father and your grandfather degraded the land that you're now farming  
**[0:32:20-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  and I always would approach that with they did not do that intentionally they were using  
**[0:32:29-0:32:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  the best information that they had at the time to do whatever it was that they did not do  
**[0:32:37-0:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:37):**  the things that they did it just so happens that what they did with all the tillage and the fallow  
**[0:32:46-0:32:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:46):**  and the lack of rotation diversity etc degraded the soil and now that we know that it's not a  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:56):**  matter of pointing fingers at someone and saying you did these bad things it's now that we know  
**[0:33:03-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:03):**  let's do better and let's restore what has been lost so it's it's it's very difficult and delicate  
**[0:33:13-0:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  to point out where someone's family ancestors basically degraded the land that we that we have  
**[0:33:25-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:25):**  today but they did that with the best knowledge that they had at the time it was not the goal to  
**[0:33:33-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  degrade the land and we can acknowledge that. When we consider the tremendous potential that  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  farms have for regeneration and that each one of us individually is on our own journey on this  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  pathway as you describe what most limits farmers from achieving the potential that they are really  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:56):**  capable of and that their farms are really capable of what holds them back in some ways  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:02):**  I think the greatest block to learning is knowledge isn't that an oxymoron  
**[0:34:08-0:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  when you think you know how something should be done it often prevents you from questioning and  
**[0:34:18-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:18):**  examining something different something more so if you grew up on a farm where things were done  
**[0:34:29-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  a certain way for you to examine doing them in a very different way you have to overcome that  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  you have to shift that paradigm you have to shift that thinking if you come into this I just spoke  
**[0:34:48-0:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  to a group of beginning farmers here a couple weeks ago and most of them had no agricultural  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:56):**  background whatsoever other than maybe planting a vegetable garden or something like that a few  
**[0:35:02-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:02):**  times so to describe to them soil is a biological system this is how it turns this is how it needs  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  to be managed in that regard they just look at that and go oh well that makes sense yes that's  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:20):**  that's how we'll approach but if you already have a paradigm based on conventional anatomy  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  you have to overcome that you have to deal with that before you can move on to the next  
**[0:35:35-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  way of thinking so it's it's actually a bit of an obstacle that's an interesting perspective and  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  not a surprising one when you really think about it I wasn't sure where you were where you were  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  going after when I responded to your first comment but yeah it is interesting that existing knowledge  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  is actually the barrier to advancing and I guess I suppose that's true in almost any scientific  
**[0:36:02-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  pursuit isn't it that it is the existing knowledge that the kind of the status quo that prevents  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  adoption of new ideas from spreading rapidly yeah we become comfortable with the whatever  
**[0:36:15-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  understanding we have so when something comes along that changes that or shows that that's not  
**[0:36:23-0:36:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  correct it does it's difficult to make that leap away from what you're comfortable with  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:31):**  now john what is something that you've uncovered or observed that you wish all farmers knew  
**[0:36:39-0:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  that just because our methods for testing the soil for nutrients are based on chemistry  
**[0:36:52-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:52):**  and crop response doesn't mean that that's how the soil actually functions as a system  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  and when people challenge me on well I do soil testing I send in my soil  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  samples they get analyzed they send me a recommendation I apply that amount of nutrient  
**[0:37:14-0:37:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  and I get the yield that that model says should and I tell them I agree with you  
**[0:37:25-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:25):**  the models work very well for dysfunctional soil so if you have a dysfunctional soil  
**[0:37:36-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  and you want to maintain a dysfunctional soil then that model works very well  
**[0:37:44-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  if you have a dysfunctional soil that you want to restore to its full biological function  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:56):**  then you have to take a whole different approach I cringe a little bit when people talk about  
**[0:38:01-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  sustainable agriculture because I don't think we want to sustain a soil that's dysfunctional  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  and I prefer the term regenerative agriculture we want to regenerate these soils  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  and then maintain them at that high level of biological function I really appreciate your  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  description of mainstream agronomy being successful for a dysfunctional soil because in  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  reality when we think about how this model of agriculture evolved and became adopted to be the  
**[0:38:38-0:38:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  mainstream during the green revolution 70 or 80 years ago it produced remarkable crop responses  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  on dysfunctional soil on the east coast of the United States and it's been a very  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:53):**  successful model on the east coast of the United States and around the world for that matter that  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  had already been degraded so that also makes a lot of sense from a historical perspective  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  as well as from an immediate obvious practical perspective when we look at the various operations  
**[0:39:09-0:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:09):**  that are executing these different models today yes the models were designed were created  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  with dysfunctional soil as a basis like you said those soils were already degraded they  
**[0:39:24-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  were already dysfunctional and then we developed a model for testing recommendations and crop response  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:34):**  using synthetic fertilizer on dysfunctional soil and so those models work very well  
**[0:39:40-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:40):**  that the problem is that they will keep you at a dysfunctional soil for forever if you don't change  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  the way you do the other aspect of these models is that they don't accurately consider all of the  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:56):**  secondary effects that we put on nitrogen fertilizer or phosphorus or potassium fertilizer  
**[0:40:03-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  and we further the development of a dysfunctional soil but at the same time we also get these  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  disease symptoms we get insect symptoms and I think one of the points you have mentioned in  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  previous conversations is the difference in perspective between symptoms and root causes  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:24):**  and not understanding or not considering these different aspects what are the differences between  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  problems and symptoms from your perspective if you've spent time and that you have children if  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:38):**  you've spent time around a two-year-old the question they ask all day long is why  
**[0:40:44-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:44):**  and I think we need to ask why enough times to be able to identify what really is the problem  
**[0:40:57-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  erosion for example soil erosion for example we've looked at that for decades as a problem  
**[0:41:05-0:41:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  when actually it's a symptom of dysfunctional soil so erosion is not a problem symptom  
**[0:41:14-0:41:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:14):**  if we restore soil and the water infiltrates into the soil instead of off erosion is no longer an  
**[0:41:24-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:24):**  issue so we need to be careful in making sure we get all the way to the root cause when we're  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  going to identify something as a problem versus a symptom because we can treat the symptom of  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  erosion and have for decades but that hasn't improved the soil it hasn't really even done  
**[0:41:48-0:42:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  that much to control or prevent erosion so people like to get caught up in in symptoms and tools and  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  and sometimes they'll even identify a problem as a goal my goal is to minimize this problem  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:09):**  well a goal should always be should always describe what you want something to be  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  I want my soil to be fully functional not just I want my soil to erode less  
**[0:42:22-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:22):**  while it remains dysfunctional if that makes sense and you also mentioned tools in your previous  
**[0:42:30-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  sentence how do you consider the use of tools in achieving these goals the thing with tools and  
**[0:42:38-0:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  I think as humans we love tools and we love to argue about tools and the same is true agriculture  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:48):**  don't you know that john deere tractors are better than others yeah for that the husky  
**[0:42:52-0:43:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  warning chainsaw is better than a still exactly and it's it's not about you have a toolbox full  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:02):**  of tools when you need to do something in particular to achieve to move you closer to your  
**[0:43:08-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  goal you grab the right tool and you apply it with that in mind but people look at no till  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  and cover crops as the answer as the silver bullet that will solve all these problems  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  those are tools if those tools aren't applied with understanding of how the soil function  
**[0:43:33-0:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:33):**  and within the context of moving toward a goal of restoring soil function then they may not  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:43):**  move you in that direction at all you can give someone a power saw and they can use it to  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  build a really nice shed or they can use it to cut their fingers off if they don't understand  
**[0:43:56-0:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  what they're doing and how to use it so yeah tools are tools are a touchy subject with a lot of  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:04):**  people but we need to keep them in perspective are they a touchy subject just because of deferring  
**[0:44:09-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:09):**  opinions or because of opinions but also because some folks want to be a good person  
**[0:44:17-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  because some folks want to just point to them as the answer to a problem because it's easy to say  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:30):**  cover crops are the answer to all of our problems or a no-till drill is the answer to all of our  
**[0:44:37-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  problems when they're not they're they're tools that can certainly help us tremendously  
**[0:44:44-0:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  in moving towards our goal but people like to simplify things and you know what what can I  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:52):**  apply to my soil that'll fix it what chemical what product can I apply to my soil to fix it  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  well that's not how it works you have to understand how the soil functions then you can  
**[0:45:04-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  choose the tools that will make some of those things happen what are some common abuses or  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  misuses of tools that you have observed well getting back to cover crops in some ways as  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  humans and if a little bit is good more is better I saw a few producers that didn't understand  
**[0:45:26-0:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  how to design a cover crop mix to achieve the goal or to achieve what it was they were after  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  had one producer years ago that we talked about including turnips in a cover crop mix and he had  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  livestock so I said well if we have this mixture and we have some turnips in there you know they  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:50):**  provide pretty good forage late in the season they won't die until it gets to you know 10 degrees  
**[0:45:56-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:56):**  Fahrenheit not just a simple frost they will help cycle some of your residue because he had wheat  
**[0:46:06-0:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  straw on there which is pretty high carbon nitrogen ratio and so we gave him some ideas  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  on how to design that mix and he said yep I'm going to do it and he went on his way and  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  went on his way and put together this mix that had way too much turnip in it  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  so the carbon nitrogen ratio ended up being very low and we had snow cover that year  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  and all of his residue decomposed the soil was completely bare in the spring and he had some  
**[0:46:43-0:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  issues with wind erosion and his neighbors were getting on his case why did you till that field  
**[0:46:51-0:46:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:51):**  last fall now it's all blowing away and he said I didn't till it they were just all the residue  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:58):**  imposed and it was black in the spring because I put too many in my cover crop mix so you know  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  that's an example of how some of these things can if you're just using tools without the understanding  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:14):**  you can start to create some other issues that's a good example John what is a topic that you would  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:23):**  like to speak more about but you're hesitant to because you sense that growers may not be  
**[0:47:28-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  ready to hear it yet that fertilizer is almost unnecessary that the amount of fertilizer that  
**[0:47:40-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  might actually be necessary to produce the desired yield in a fully functioning biological system  
**[0:47:52-0:48:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  might be close to zero it's not anywhere near the levels of fertilizer I got in trouble when  
**[0:48:01-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:01):**  I worked for NRCS for saying that in some cases you don't need any fertilizer in some of these  
**[0:48:10-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:10):**  systems that producers have been doing no till with diverse rotations for 10-15 years I suggested  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  that they leave a check strip with no fertilizer to see how well their soil would supply nutrients  
**[0:48:27-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  to their plants and a number of them did that and realized that they didn't need anywhere near the  
**[0:48:36-0:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  amounts of fertilizer that the conventional chemical soil testing recommendations showed  
**[0:48:44-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:44):**  well that got a lot of people in NRCS fertilizer industry and extension upset with me because I  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  was suggesting that and pointing that out so that's something that I've learned to approach  
**[0:48:59-0:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:59):**  carefully well it's certainly something I've been speaking a lot about and I know that others have  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:07):**  as well in the last half a dozen years or so when you ran these check strips you were  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  looking at or the potential for no fertilizer needed what were you observing did you observe  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:19):**  significant differences between what the crop looked like visually and what the yields were  
**[0:49:24-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:24):**  like and I asked this question because we've worked with growers who've run similar check  
**[0:49:28-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  strips and the area where the fertilizer is applied appears much more visually appealing  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  you might get larger plant biomass you might get might get more vigorous crop growth  
**[0:49:41-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:41):**  particularly early on but when you get to the point of truth of actual yield and not I mean  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  that's disregarding profitability which is a more important question when you get to the point of  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  truth regarding yield that we would often find that the fertilized area did not do any more than  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:02):**  the unfertilized area in some cases not even as much so what were you observing basically the  
**[0:50:08-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  same thing and producers were used to looking at this very deep green color in their crop very  
**[0:50:20-0:50:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:20):**  early in the season as a result of these what I think were excessive application so where they  
**[0:50:31-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:31):**  had the check strip those plants were not that deep green color early on and they were obviously  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  concerned about that they said well you know this this is not looking good and I said just wait  
**[0:50:47-0:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  the soil warms up the biology gets a little more active you know and it'll get on with it and  
**[0:50:54-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:54):**  later in the season the area that was fertilized that was very dark green and it faded in how  
**[0:51:04-0:51:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  intense the color was and the strip that was not fertilized improved to the point where they looked  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:12):**  very similar so then you know at the end of the year the yield was often maybe five percent  
**[0:51:21-0:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  different the the unfertilized was maybe five percent less than the fertilized now on the  
**[0:51:30-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:30):**  fields the producers that had been doing no-till and diverse rotations for oh at least 10 years 15  
**[0:51:39-0:51:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  years where they applied and this is anecdotal but they told me that where they applied 40%  
**[0:51:48-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:48):**  to 50 pounds of actual n on a check strip so they would do a strip with no fertilizer  
**[0:51:57-0:52:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  with 50 pounds with 100 pounds with 150 pounds whatever just to see for themselves that once  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:04):**  they got up to or beyond 50 pounds of n their yields actually declined that doesn't surprise me  
**[0:52:10-0:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:10):**  my and my theory was that screwed up the soil and microbiology relationships that were there  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:20):**  and ready to function but that fertilizer basically sidelined that biology and really  
**[0:52:27-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  screwed up that relationship that you have in a functional soil and I said yeah you guys have a  
**[0:52:36-0:52:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  pretty well functioning soil now that if you put that kind of fertilizer on you're going to mess  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:43):**  things up not improve your yield as it would have in a dysfunctional soil  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  john that is such a key observation and something that we have also been observing and i've started  
**[0:52:54-0:53:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  talking about it and that is we don't think of nitrogen fertilizer as having a yield drag  
**[0:53:01-0:53:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:01):**  effect we've been indoctrinated to think that yield drag comes as a result of nutrient deficiencies  
**[0:53:10-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:10):**  but we've actually observed quite a number of cases of yield drag occurring as a result of  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  nitrogen and particularly nitrogen and potassium fertilization also phosphorus to a lesser degree  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  where these soluble forms of fertilizers are being added and they're actually  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  limiting yields the healthier the soil becomes the more of a yield drag that these fertilizers have  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:35):**  and i think there's any number of reasons for that ranging from the nitrate use efficiency  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  and the energy conversion cost that you mentioned at the beginning plus the impact that they have  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:45):**  on biology so i think the kind of the concluding point that really comes out of this conversation  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  for me is many of us don't have a frame of reference and we no longer understand what  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:53:57):**  healthy functional soils actually look like and actually should behave like anymore because we  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:02):**  may never have experienced them that's true if you know our soils a lot of our soils have been  
**[0:54:09-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:09):**  dysfunctional for human generations so we think that we should be able to do that  
**[0:54:18-0:54:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  so we think that what we currently have in the capacity of our agricultural soils to function  
**[0:54:30-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:30):**  is normal and it's not it's a soil that's very degraded and its capacity to function is only  
**[0:54:41-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  a fraction of what it really was or really could be and it's difficult for people to  
**[0:54:50-0:55:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:54:50):**  wrap their mind around that this soil can produce as good or higher yields with much fewer inputs  
**[0:55:02-0:55:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  than you thought possible and that's exactly true no not very many people know what a functioning  
**[0:55:10-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:10):**  soil looks like i haven't seen them for a while thank you john for all the thoughts and the wisdom  
**[0:55:17-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  that you've shared do you have any other thoughts that you would like to discuss before we wrap  
**[0:55:23-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  things up i think just to get people to look at some of these things is going to require  
**[0:55:31-0:55:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  a great deal of of education including demonstrations so people can see these things  
**[0:55:39-0:55:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:39):**  for themselves and learn how to manage the soil as a biological system and take that seriously  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:48):**  that this is for real soils really are a biological system that's the way they were designed to  
**[0:55:55-0:56:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:55:55):**  function it wasn't something that i did or designed that's that's the way it always has been  
**[0:56:02-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:02):**  and the sooner we understand that it makes more sense environmentally and economically to manage  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  something the way it was designed to be managed the way it was designed to function um but we're  
**[0:56:18-0:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:18):**  all going to be and the more productive and the healthier our agriculture is going to be and that  
**[0:56:25-0:56:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:25):**  we will be as a result true thank you john very much for sharing all of your wisdom and experiences  
**[0:56:32-0:56:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:32):**  i highly recommend that everyone gets a copy of john's book a soil owner's manual the subtitle is  
**[0:56:42-0:56:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:42):**  how to restore and maintain soil health and i am adding his book to my recommended reading list  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:49):**  and we will include a link to the book in the show notes and wherever else that you might be  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  able to find this podcast so thank you much for being here john i look forward to more  
**[0:57:00-0:57:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/RAP_Jon_Stika_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:57:00):**  conversations in the future thank you for having me it's been a pleasure

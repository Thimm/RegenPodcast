**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  Hi friends, this is John and this is the Regent of Agriculture podcast where we talk about the  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:04):**  agronomic sciences and the cultural management practices that regenerate plant health, soil  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  health, and farms financial health as well as ultimately public health where we can have  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:15):**  conversations about growing really healthy food. My guest for this episode is Tim Parton who is a  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  farmer in the UK. Tim has been on a really interesting journey for some time adopting  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:27):**  regenerative agriculture practices and principles. Tim thank you for being here with us today. I'm  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  really excited to learn more about your story and the journey that you've been on. Can you tell us  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  a little bit about your farming context? What's the climate like? What crops are you growing?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  And what has your journey been like on your operation over the last decade or so?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  Thanks John, well it's a pleasure. It's always nice to spread the word. My journey probably  
**[0:00:50-0:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  started in 2009 but I'd always had an interest in soil really prior to that and I could never  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:00:57):**  understand how farmers could abuse the one attribute that they relied on the most and  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  yet it was always left to last in quite often the cases. So from 2009 I started to go down the strip  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:10):**  till route and my soils jumped, worm numbers came forward and things started to work. By 2015 I  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  realised I was still moving too much soil in my mind. I'd got very interested in biology by this  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  time. I'd started playing around with using biology in 2012 and I'd had some fantastic results.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  So in 2015 I made the jump just to direct drilling and the big thing for me there was being able to  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  get biology down next to the seed so I adapted the drill straight away to be able to do that.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:41):**  These days I farm pretty much without fungicides. I'm a total believer if we get the nutrition  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:48):**  right the plant won't get ill. If that plant's balanced the disease pests just won't look at it.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  If they do I will still use biology to take control of disease coming into that plant  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  but the biology really is a result and I've got it wrong all the climate's been against me.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:05):**  I grow quite a variation of crops here so I'm about 50-50 winter autumn sort of drilling  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  and spring cropping. So on the spring cropping I'm always getting cover crops in there  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:16):**  with as much variation as I can because I'm a real big believer the more variation I've got  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  above ground the more variation I've got below ground we're going to be feeding different  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  microbes and really getting that soil moving again. The rotation here I'll be as varied as I  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  possibly can so I'll have winter wheat which is 4 million for bread making. I'll have winter oil  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  seed rape or canola as you would probably know it more as. I'll grow spring barley for for malting  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  to make beer. I'll grow spring beans which are on a seed contract. I grow spring lupins again which  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  are on a seed contract but I'm a big fan of the lupin it just does so much for soil I haven't  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:02:55):**  found a crop quite like lupins other than grass that improves soil so much more and I think a lot  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  of farmers in the UK should be growing protein because it seems madness in pork protein halfway  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:05):**  around the world when we could be growing a good lot of air and reducing that carbon footprint.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  I'll grow spring goats and as I say I've also got grass in the rotation which I'm making for  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  haylage for horses because we're quite close to Wolverhampton Birmingham so there's a big  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  horse population around here and that grass gets rotated around the farm so it's a real good carbon  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  sequencer and a real good way of improving that soil. What does your climate look like and what  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  parts of the US might that compare with in terms of temperature and rainfall? I don't know what  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  we'd compare with rainfall I normally average 27 to 30 inches the last couple of winters we've  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  been a bit higher and summer temperatures would typically be around that 23 this year we hit 30  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:49):**  but it was a very some very hot days here we sort of broke some of the records for those temperatures  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  but that would be sort of around the norm we're quite wet because we're in the west of the country  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  so we've wetted them what the east of the UK would be. This year I've missed out on a lot of the rain  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:03):**  I was like a desert there was rain all around me and it just didn't want to come anywhere near me  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  but that's a different story. You mentioned that you are not using any herbicides anymore  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:14):**  and you also hinted at not using any fungicides and insecticides I'm really intrigued by what  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:19):**  that transition looked like. I'm still using some herbicides John I've reduced it I don't use any  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  pre-emergence herbicides since moving to this system and I've improved my soils I don't really  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  get the grass weeds I had a little bit of brome coming this spring because we were so dry and cold  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:35):**  crops didn't get going the soil was left open so mother nature decided to put something there for  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:40):**  me but other than that you know instead of sort of like doing pre-emergence and probably another  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:46):**  autumn herbicide I'm now down just to spring herbicide on wheat which is a massive saving from  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  where I used to be. I haven't used insecticides for six years now and that to me was a real  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:04:59):**  breakthrough I mean once you get your natural predators working you get that plant balanced  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  there just isn't the need to use insecticides I mean my canola to put it in your term of what you  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  call it I drilled it this year probably two weeks ago three weeks ago the field was absolutely  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  crawling with flea beetle they were everywhere they were in the barley as we've combined the  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  crop the grain store was full of flea beetle they were just everywhere and the student helping me  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:25):**  said you can't possibly put oil seed rape into that condition and I said well as long as the  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:30):**  plant's balanced they're not going to be able to feed on it because the sugars are just going to  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:34):**  be too thick they're just going to collapse and they're just they're just going to have indigestion  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  they're going to leave and sure enough yes you can see where one or two have tasted it but it's  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  just not for them and they've left and I've got a good crop of canola coming forward it's keeping  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  that plant balanced and understanding why that pest is there and in my experience nine times out  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  of ten that pest is there because we've caused it to be there we've created a problem that mother  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:05:58):**  nature knows is a problem and so she's reacting to it for you know to save that problem getting any  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  worse that's how I always look at things. So this is fascinating you're offering a really fascinating  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  example of flea beetle presence in a field I mean it's this common perception that getting canola  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  seedlings off to a healthy start without strong flea beetle pressure is unheard of there's no way  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:19):**  of managing that or controlling that without using neonicotinoids as seed treatments. What are the  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  tools or the management practices that you have used to accomplish that outcome what do you  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  attribute your success to in producing flea beetle resistant seedlings? Because I've got the liquid  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  applicator on the drill which I've put on and the guy called Trevor Tappin Tappin engineering  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  helped me build it or he designed the bulk of it we work together a lot I'll give him problems  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  and he gives me the solution and it works really well. So one cycle bit was able to do that John  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  then when I'm drilling I'll put diatomaceous earth down there which obviously gets converted  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  into monosolic acid so that's already making that cell wall stronger so it's making it more  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  difficult. I'll then put a balance of nutrition down which we normally solve for molybdenum and  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:06):**  boron magnesium down there just to help that plant and give it the ingredients it wants to start and  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  process the sugars and then I'll also use a lot of humic acid because that plant sucks that humic  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:18):**  acid in it will just be able to convert those sugars into more complex sugars so that it's just  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  not going to be a problem those flea beetle just aren't going to be able to cope with that plant  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  growing and this year has really proved it even though I thought oh I might be pushing it this  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  year with the amount we got but they just left wasn't suitable it wasn't the right food and  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  they've moved on. Wow that is incredible so how close is your liquid application to the seed and  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  when you think about a seed being planted and germinating it's often thought that the majority  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  of the nutrition comes from the seed itself for the first week or two so how quickly are these  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  young seedlings tapping into the nutrients that you're applying? I've always had the same philosophy  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  that you know that seed's got everything it needs to start off and I don't disagree with that but  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  as it's going to be moving forward I want to make sure it's balanced from day one. With having the

**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  theory right and the results are fantastic in my mind. With that I've always had great successes  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:28):**  I've never stopped growing canola a lot of farmers over here have stopped growing canola because flea

**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  further west you haven't got as big a flea beetle or they haven't found or you've been lucky but  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  this year there was no doubt I was swamped out with flea beetle they were everywhere  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:47):**  and I haven't lost a plant to flea beetle at all. That's pretty incredible what about insect control  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:53):**  and other crops if you haven't used in insecticides in six years what have been your major pests that  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  you have overcome on some of your other crops? The other big one really is BYDV and again I don't

**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:15):**  that nutrition there. Winter cropping I don't tend to bother I put humic acid down and I will brew up  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  a little biology so I normally brew up some phosphorous releasing bacteria sometimes some

**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:30):**  probably at the stage now where I don't need to do that because the soils have moved on that far  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  and they're functioning they're very healthy. I do extract compost as well I'm playing around with

**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  than just brewing up the relatively rude microbes if that makes sense. For those of our listeners  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:04):**  who are not familiar with the acronym of BYDV can you tell us what that is? Yeah it's barley yellow  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  dwarf virus and aphids carry it around with them so not all aphids but some aphids do so as they  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:16):**  start to feed on the plant they infect the plant with the virus and then the plant becomes very  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:21):**  stunted and especially in the spring it'll look like a big elephant has just walked across the  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:25):**  field and there's just big holes everywhere of crop if you've got it. There's always a worry when  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  you first leave the insecticide out because I've been brought up that oh while you're going through  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:36):**  to shut the insecticide in you don't want to get BYDV they're always working on that fear factor  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:42):**  so when you step out from that sort of set of being safe in the flock and doing the same as  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:47):**  everybody else it's always a little bit nerve-wracking so I do walk my crops probably  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:51):**  more than ever because I'm always looking I'm more relaxed these days because I know I haven't got a  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  problem. I just recently combined my lupins and I was just cleaning the combine off as I came out  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  the field and I looked back and the field was just a mass of cobwebs but those spiders are there  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  they're working for me 24 7 and because I haven't been killing everything off they're just getting  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  stronger and stronger so in the autumn you walk out in the morning when you walk through a crop  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  you'll come out the field and your shoes are just white with cobwebs because they're there my

**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah when you see those fields covered with cobwebs in the fall it really raises the question of  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  what is the biomass what is the volume of insects required to sustain that population because it's  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  a pretty extraordinary population I've seen it so those are pretty awesome photos. Exactly and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  that's why you know I like to see one or two aphids about because everything's got to eat  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  it's just being in balance with nature we haven't got to create this imbalance it's everything was  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:54):**  functioning perfect until we started to balls it all up for want of a better word as human beings  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  it's four million years you know 30 300 million years this has all been evolving and then along  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  comes human being and saying it's all right we'll take it from now we know what we're doing and  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  we didn't have a clue and it's only now where we're starting to repair some of us are starting  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:15):**  to repair that damage that has been done for so long and we've done so much damage in such a small  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:20):**  time in my mind. Your comment reminds me of an experience that we had on a high tunnel tomato  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  operation in eastern Pennsylvania where when we first got there this farmer had been doing a lot  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  of work with biological management and introducing beneficials his tomato leaves were covered with  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:38):**  beneficials as in we counted on some leaves as much as 50 to 70 beneficial insects per leaf  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:45):**  it was quite remarkable and after working with him for a year or two on nutrition management I  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  think it was the second year that we were working with him on managing his nutrition all of a sudden  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  the beneficial population dropped dramatically it didn't disappear entirely but it dropped  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  dramatically because there were no longer aphids and spider mites present there was no longer  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:07):**  enough of a food source there to sustain the really large population that had been there  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  historically so it was really intriguing to observe how those population dynamics shifted  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  and changed with quantity of the beneficial and the predators present based on the presence or  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  absence of their food source. Totally agree I think that's what's happened here you know I  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  still get slugs for instance but because the plant is more balanced now there isn't the polyamides  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  there so the slugs aren't coming in it's yes I see the odd one but I like the odd one about  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  because those caribbean beetles have got to have something to feed on it you've just got to sustain  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:39):**  everything but it's keeping everything balanced balance is key to my operation as I do here  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:44):**  but I totally agree once you've got that plant balanced there isn't the need for all those  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  insects to be coming in to take advantage of that weak plant as I call it because that plant isn't  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  healthy so nature's trying to get rid of that plant because it knows it's not healthy and we're  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:00):**  trying to keep it alive so we're killing everything so we're all the while trying to stop that process  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  happening when really it's just that's caused the whole problem in the first place. You mentioned  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  you're doing cover crops I guess my question is what in addition to the overall management  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:14):**  practices what do you credit your success to managing the aphids in the barley? In the barley  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:20):**  again it's putting a little bit nutrition down so as it's balanced the other big thing that I've  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  done is I'm constantly bringing nitrogen down and I think once you start to bring that nitrogen down  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:31):**  you haven't got those weak cells so you're not attracting everything anyway so this year I've  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:37):**  grown spring barley and I was down to 36 kilos of N and that was near enough apart from 20 kilos all  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  foliar applied because I love foliar applied N because it's far more efficient the plant it's 90  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  available to the plant and the plant is using that up it's different to soil applied where I'm  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:14:56):**  probably only using 40 or 50 percent which is all getting leached out going down the drains getting  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:02):**  into our oceans and creating all these dead zones and the argument people always give me well we've  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  got to feed a growing population well we can feed a growing population and still regenerate our soils  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:13):**  I've proved that and other farmers have proved that but we can't keep killing the planet 70 to  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  90 percent of our oxygen is coming from marine photosynthesis what are we going to do wait for  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:23):**  everybody just to starve of air and then do something we've got to act now it's it's we've  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  had enough of killing the planet there is no planet B and every inhabitant of this planet has  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  got to stand up and be counted and demand food produced in a regenerative system because it's  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:41):**  those buyers those consumers that have got the most power and if they start to demand it  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  supermarkets will react governments will react and that's how we're going to make the real massive  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  changes needed in my mind to the agricultural system of the world because that's what we're  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  working on and it's farmers that can do the greatest good to repair this world and to repair  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  the damage that's being done you know and we all should be standing up and cheering and shouting  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:16:07):**  about what we can achieve yeah there is so much opportunity for improving the outcomes and

**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  are you putting on foliar applications on your various crops what types of nutrients and how are

**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  soil application so i use a little bit of ammonium nitrate just to all the while really john trying  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  to to get the soil to produce its own and that's my end goal is the area 78 percent end there's  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  enough up there for what we need to use it's just getting that nitrogen fixing bacteria to actually  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  work and that's what i'm always striving to get but i have to stay profitable as a business to get  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  there so it's slowly slowly in little steps so i'll start off with the soil applied and then as

**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:18:31):**  to make sure that plant is balanced so if i need to correct an imbalance i can as you always say

**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:02):**  always be testing and i'd say if it is a dry time we've had two dry springs here where i've had to  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:07):**  step in and do a bit more foliar feed than what i normally would because biology hasn't been working  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  and the plants have started to suffer so it's just monitoring and reacting to what's going on  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  and that's where it needs to be tested on a regular basis because everything's changing all  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  the while you know you could do a test today and then all of a sudden it warms up in two days it's  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:25):**  a different test result that's where we need to be there on the ball testing and just seeing what's  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:31):**  going on it's just i always class it as you know it's like the world-class athlete and we're just  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  trying to make it the nutrition perfect to get the best out of that athlete and that's that's how i  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  see my plants you mentioned the critical importance of needing to be profitable needing to be  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:47):**  economically viable in order to be able to do environmental work and i find that interesting  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:52):**  in the context of our conversation of foliar applications it's very common to look at foliar  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  applications from the perspective of what is this going to cost rather than what are the potential  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:02):**  rewards so what are the economic impacts of foliar applications for you and what is your  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  frequency of application are you putting on applications once or twice a season half a dozen  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:11):**  times a season what does that look like well there's a few questions there john but on the  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  financial one compared to where i used to be where i'd probably be 240 kilos to 270 kilos of n i'm now  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:22):**  sort of standard practice would be 120 to 150 and obviously i'm bringing it low and i'm doing trials  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:29):**  every year so at the 240 it works out a lot cheaper to do it foliar applications at the 120  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  work last year it worked out a little bit cheaper it might have been 10 pound a hectare cheaper  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  to do foliar it was certainly still cheaper than and not you know it wasn't more expensive  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  but the results are far better in my mind because obviously we're not polluting we're not throwing  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  on all this nitrogen needlessly which is burning the carbon out of our soil so it's definitely the  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  right way to be going in my mind i use a company flex fertilizer which is it's a ever fertilized  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:04):**  over here but it's actually from denmark where it was produced and in denmark there nitrogen  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  restrictions are very high so that's why they develop flex so it's an aim i then it's a little  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  bit further down the line than the urea so that's what makes it so readily available this year i've  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:18):**  had very good results the yields were pretty much on par with the rest of the farm i hadn't thrown  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  all that nitrogen on there you talked about the reduced cost of being about 10 pounds  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:29):**  an acre less is that just for material costs because when you consider foliar applications  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  and more frequent trips across the field you obviously have higher application costs as well  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:37):**  the application costs i suppose it isn't really it would be compared to my old conventional system  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:44):**  but because i'm quite often going through the cop to keep it balanced now because i'm not spending  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  the money on fungicides so i'm not doing that application of fungicides i'm probably not doing  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:54):**  any more applications with the sprayer it might be one if it was a real hard time or two but i  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  see that as cheap the sprayer sat there it's my own sprayer the tractor sat there so it's only  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  really my time and a little bit of diesel to knit through and if that's going to give me a healthy  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  crop then it's time well spent in my mind so that one i suppose if you was on a real big system and  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:14):**  you know it took you a week to get through the crop might be something you have to look at but  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  i still think the financial savings you're having from not using fungicides and not using all that  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:23):**  nitrogen you can almost buy two outfits and have two people going through the crop to speed the  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  job up the end game has still got to be to have that healthy plant and get the full potential from  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  that plant so it doesn't really concern me if i did an extra application to what i normally do  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  but it's not i'm not going through that many more times i normally three or four times a season i go  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  through if it was a real rough season it'd probably be six but you know there's this  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  perception that adopting regenerative agriculture practices and managing nutrition more intensively  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:54):**  is more expensive and that has occasionally in some situations been true in the past although  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:22:59):**  it's certainly not universally true but that has changed for us in our experience in the last  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  particular last year or so as commodity fertilizer prices have increased it is now less expensive in  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  many cases significantly less expensive to manage attrition in this regenerative approach and only  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  apply what the crop needs rather than all the extra npk that many growers are familiar with  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  applying i think i'd agree with that you know i haven't applied p and k fertilizers for 10 years  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:29):**  now so that's that's a massive saving on this farm you know that'd be 25 30 000 straight away  
**[0:23:34-0:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  i'm not buying as much nitrogen i'm not spending 100 pounds a hectare on on fungicides you know  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:42):**  i'm not spending the money on herbicides so the little bit i spend on nutrition is still far far  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:49):**  less than what i was spending on all these synthetic horrible products that are just  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  killing everything you know we've got herbicides we've got fungicides we've got insecticides  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  and to me all the breathing they've got in common is suicide to us as a success  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:09):**  i like that so i want to come back and talk about the the fungicide applications and how you're  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  managing diseases but before we go there let's talk a little bit more about your fertilizer  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  applications you mentioned that you haven't applied any p and k for a decade how are you  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  able to get away with that are you tapping into historical soil reserves of applied materials  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  do you believe that's going to be sustainable for the future what does that look like for you  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  i totally believe it's going to be sustainable for the future i mean potassium for example as  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  you well know john is just continually cycling it's just continually cycling and if anything i've got  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:45):**  going back to the the old sort of soil tests that we have to do here for government purposes you  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  know my indices are far higher now than what they ever were if anything potassium is more readily  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:24:54):**  available which it is because it's just totally cycling the whole process is cycling the whole  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  ecosystem has come alive and the same with phosphorus as a phosphorus is again my indices  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:05):**  are just high which i don't take much regard to soil tests if i'm totally honest but the plant is  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  just putting out those exudates and calling for phosphorus and it's only taking what it needs in  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:14):**  my mind yes i might put some potassium on as a folio when we're in a real growing period because  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  the plant isn't taking a nothing and it's just growing so fast and i'll address that imbalance  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:24):**  if i have to but phosphorus and potassium they say phosphorus it's just cycling the bacteria  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  releasing it just on on enough we've got so many rocks and everything's still in the soil here that  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  i can't see generations to come ever having a problem it's just totally working in harmony  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  just as it was meant to and if i went out there and threw some phosphorus you're only too aware  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:45):**  of the damage i do to all the fungi that i've got i just wipe everything out it's the nature  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  never intended for us to have to keep throwing all these elements on it was always supposed to be a

**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:02):**  step in and stop that cycling process then you've just created a drug addict and you've got to keep  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  feeding it all the while because you've stopped nature doing her job because we know better  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  yeah we've got it figured out and generations they come they'll look back at what we did last  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  century and they'll just put their hands over their head because it's just they'll never  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  understand what why we were so stupid i don't think to have to have done a system that was  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  working perfectly well and here we come along and we just interrupt it all and it costs us a whole  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:30):**  load of money for a problem that never existed oh but we were able to increase yields  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:35):**  yeah hasn't that one been used a lot in the past throw more on  
**[0:26:44-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  you know it's interesting that we you and i say that as a joke and we laugh about it but for many  
**[0:26:50-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  people and even many farmers today still don't recognize and don't realize that the idea that the  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  marketing slogan of being able to increase yields is just a fallacy that you can actually produce  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  equivalent or higher yields using these regenerative practices than what the mainstream  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:09):**  is today and we know it because we've seen it observed it and experienced it but most people  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:14):**  have not no and i think that's why i try and shout and use social media such a lot just to show  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  people what i am achieving because i always say it john but if i can leave this planet and i've made  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:26):**  the slightest bit of difference to that planet health and helping it recover that it's my time  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:31):**  was it's the best reward i could have financial gains is exactly the same as that knowing that  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:36):**  you've made a difference to the planet and that's where i always help farmers and that's where i  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  will always shout about what i'm achieving because it's so important that people here and as i said  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:47):**  earlier it's the consumer we really need to educate because once the consumer knows what we  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:52):**  can achieve as regeneration farmers they're going to demand that food and that's that's our got to  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:27:57):**  be all of our goal really is to educate the consumer because once they know the food can  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  be produced and we can be healing the planet at the same time and moving everything forward i  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  mean the wildlife that's come back here i have a bird ringing group come on the farm and we've got  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:12):**  kestrels back on the farm and we've reared 14 chicks in the last three years four years  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:18):**  we've got skylarks which are red data species and they're just abundant here but the only reason  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  they're abundant is because i've stopped using insecticides i've got this food here for them  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  when we have the the blue tits and the great tits in the spring and we go around the nesting boxes  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:32):**  there'll be eight to ten chicks in those boxes and the only reason the clutches are so big is  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:37):**  because there's so much food here wow and it just attracts everything everything comes back it's  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  just the same as the soil once you start to get the food source there the worms come back everything  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  starts working nature is so forgiving of the mistakes and the damage we've done if we just  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  let her heal she'll heal we just got to work in harmony with her if we work together with nature  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  it's just like trying to paddle a canoe or river you can paddle and you can be as fit as a fiddle  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:01):**  but eventually that river is going to beat you and that's the track i think we've been on for  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  the last 50 60 years is we're paddling up river and nature is always going to beat us it's far  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  easy just to go with the flow and to paddle down river instead of up river yeah wow thank you tim  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  it is a really enjoyable and really incredible to see how ecology can recover and not just not just  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  the ecology that we study and pay a lot of attention to for crop production purposes like  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  mycorrhizal fungi and earthworms and so forth but also the macro ecology of the bird populations and  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  the honeybee populations and so forth in the local areas so that is really powerful they all exist  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:41):**  and feed off each other but the whole system is working here now it's it's just a pleasure to walk  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  around the farm and to see everything in abundant i grow a lot of flower margins and the like around  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  the farm so there's always late pollinators i've still got flowers going now so the pollinators  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  are always got some food source and those pollinators are so important to us as farmers  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  we need to look after them we've to say again we've abused them for so long thinking we didn't  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  need to rely on them without pollinators we're all doomed insects are so important to us  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  so we mentioned the yield improvements that are possible with a region of agriculture practices  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  what has your personal experience been in your history on your farm over your transition period  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:22):**  how have yields shifted i've never had a yield dip when i first started out it was always said that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  oh in year three you'll have a massive yield dip i never had that yields have always been  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:33):**  sustainable as long as i get the water i can get some very good yields this year my x days week  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  which is just a variety of a group two a biscuit wheat i'd put 120 kilos of nitrogen on there it  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  didn't have any fungicides no insecticides no seed treatments and that was yielding 11 to 11  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:52):**  and a half tons to the to the hectare and that's a conservative figure it's probably a little bit  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:30:56):**  higher but i never like to do pub figures as we talk over here you know i'm not one for boasting  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  i'm just saying what can be achieved and that to me just proves the point that if you keep  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  everything in balance the yields that can be achieved and it's not all about nitrogen nitrogen  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  is just a part of it and it's just utilizing it properly to get the best out of it rather than  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:16):**  just throw more on throw more on and just destroy everything that we're trying to achieve really  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  circling the conversation back to nitrogen on wheat reminds me that i never got an answer to  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  the question on foliar frequency how many trips through the field did you use to make with a  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  sprayer with insecticide fungicide applications and how does that compare with what you're doing  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  today with nutrition management on a fungicide i'd have done a t naught as we call it here t1 t2  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:44):**  t3 and a t4 i now call them fs1 and fs naught it's foliar spray because i'd like to get away  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  from that chemical sort of mentality so i'd still be going on a similar basis on with a nutrition  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:31:57):**  based on a biology based it wouldn't be much different it will just be john if i've done a  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  sat test and i can see an imbalance then i'll slip one in between those two but that's just money  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  well spent in my mind because i want the best out of that plant if i keep that plant healthy it's  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:13):**  not going to get diseased it's not going to lose yield potential so to me that little bit of  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  expense of going through again is just well worth it it's why would you not want to do that what  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  is not to like about gaining the full potential of that plant it's i can't see why anybody could  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:32:29):**  argue with having to make another pass it's just not worth you know the time to spray so quick you

**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  the very high bricks readings that you're achieving which is a struggle for many people  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  to achieve even some people who are using sap analysis that when they start out using sap

**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:21):**  is a struggle so where are you there's a general rule if i've got the moisture i mean if if it's  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  low moisture i can be up in the 20s i could be 22 23 but when i've had the moisture because it  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  always changes when i get rain so i always expect to be somewhere around the 17 18 that's that's my  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:33:38):**  norm and if it's we're in a drier period and it's warm i will go up to 20 to 20 degrees but

**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:17):**  if you want the best out of them you've got to be out there and paying them the attention it's

**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  the same philosophy to me i'm certain that those elevator bricks readings are of course they are

**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  you're not doing those anymore no what management what management practices um are you using to  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  replace the fungicide applications i do rely on silica an awful lot so we use potassium silicate  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:34:56):**  and we use diatomaceous herbs so silica is a big one for me just to keep that cell wall strong  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:02):**  i work closely with a guy called nick woodjack nick is very much a biological agronomist so he  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  comes in and helps me and we have some good discussions but we're always trying to do it  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:12):**  with nutrition and biology chemicals would be a really really last resort for us we would both

**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  would but i can't really see me ever being in that situation now because the nutrition we've got it  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  wrong if we if we had to get to that sort of stage the one thing i noticed when i first stopped using  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  fungicides if i chopped a field of straw that straw would just break down so quickly within  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  a couple of weeks it's gone whereas when you've used the fungicide it's still stiff it's brittle  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  because you've put a barrier there for fungi not to be able to do their job so why would it go  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  quickly because i put a barrier there to stop it that was the real eye opener to me was the fact  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  how straw breaks down and how quickly the biology utilized that decay matter than if it had a  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  fungicide there and it's the same when we've done trials with with seed treatments because it's not  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  too bad now but a couple of years ago it was very difficult here to buy new seed didn't have a seed  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  treatment i'd ask for it not to be treated sure enough it would roll up on farm and it had been  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:16):**  seed treated so i'd grow it in a separate part of the field and it would be drilled at the same  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  seeds per square meter on the same day at the same depth with the same machine the untreated  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  seed would be up 10 days earlier than the treated seed because i've got that wow connection and  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:31):**  things were growing and it would be up here and the treaty would be just poking out the ground and  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:36):**  you've got to keep doing trials everybody should be doing trials on their own farm because every  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  farm is different and if we all shared the data we can just move this thing so much quicker  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:45):**  being the old cloak and dagger of oh i'm not telling you what i've done because it's worked  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  and you just come on let's share it's bigger than all of us as farmers to take this forward  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:53):**  you know we've got a planet at stake here we've we've got to push it forward it's what it's all  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  about there's enough money out there for all of us to make a good profit out of it we don't have  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:03):**  to be cloak and dagger and not share information information is king you know i've observed that  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  it is those growers who share the information the most freely who also get shared the most  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  information from other growers it creates this reciprocity effect where the more you share with  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  others the more you learn that benefits you and your operation and it just it accelerates the  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:25):**  overall system and those growers who attempt to hold things close to their vests because they  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  believe they're the best they're doing a really great job they end up getting left behind in many  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  cases i've always got a saying john that like attracts like so i think like-minded people  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:40):**  always attract each other because it's just the way they are and you know everybody can move  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  forward then and it's it just makes the whole process so much fun if you can talk to a like-minded  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  person and just chat about your experiences and what you achieved and what went wrong and  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  share and we all move forward because that conversation might save you a year's worth of  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  trials because you know the outcome already and that's what it's all about because then we can  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  just progress because there's so much more to learn and do yet but i think you know the journey  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  it's just fascinating to me it's i always get whatever i do i'm always one that i've got to  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:12):**  know everything about it and i don't think i'll ever get to that situation with regen farming i  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  think every year i'm doing something different it's no it's moving so fast at the minute it's  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:21):**  just hard to keep up your experience with planting naked seed without any you know it's interesting  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:27):**  that we call that naked seed we should actually be considering it just healthy seed without all  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  the toxins applied to it definitely my observation has been that when growers try that i would  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  with different crops in different environments about 70 or 80 percent of the time the untreated  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:44):**  seed significantly outperforms the treated seed just as you described it emerges earlier it's  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  faster it's stronger it takes off and goes so much quicker that isn't a hundred percent of the time  
**[0:38:55-0:39:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:38:55):**  there are some soils which are so conducive to pathogen growth they're so disease enhancing  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:03):**  that those seed treatments are needed because those soils are incredibly sick in those cases  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  and this is why people need to test it on their own soils in those cases that's when we need to  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  take some time to grow cover crops or put on some compost tea or inoculants to shift that microbial  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  population so we can get that same type of reaction and response and i believe this is  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  something you've been doing as well for fusarium control and for different diseases you're also  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:27):**  producing perhaps some compost compost teas and brews can you tell us a little bit about that and  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:31):**  what that looks like for fusarium control i brew up a consortium tea because i'm a little bit  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  nervous about using compost teas at that stage of growth just in case i've had some legionnaires  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  disease in that compost and then i'm putting it all over a million weeks i'm not brave enough to  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:49):**  do that so i'll use what's what we call a consortium tea so it'll be bacillus subtilis and bacillus  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  and bacillus amyloquefacin i can brew that up then for 12 24 hours and by brewing it i can do it for  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  as little as two pound a hectare or two pound fifty a hectare pound an acre just to make things simple  
**[0:40:08-0:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  i started doing that three or four years ago the first year i did it i wasn't totally convinced  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:15):**  as i never am i always want proof it's just the scientist in me i want to make sure it's actually  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:20):**  doing something and so i left an area untreated i treated an area with chemical and i treated  
**[0:40:26-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:26):**  the area with bacillus where we hadn't treated we'd got 36 percent fusarium where we treated with the

**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  we chemical i think we were about 20 to 25 and from that down i just stopped using chemicals  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  bacillus is just far far better at fusarium and then the beauty of it is john obviously i'm not  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  carrying that over to use that seed to continually grow fusarium i've stopped the cycle which is a  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  massive breakthrough to me it's just pushing it forward and say it's just a far better control  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  than any chemical most chemicals are about 50 or 60 percent control whereas fusarium i would say  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  it's near enough 90 it's just fantastic uh bacillus sorry not museum yeah you know this this brings  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:15):**  up an interesting point as farmers we need to think differently about whether we are using  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  products for plant health or for disease control and this is an important paradigm shift from a  
**[0:41:28-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  regulatory perspective because in many cases okay take bacillus subtilis for example or these  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  various bacillus species we can apply these products to enhance plant health and enhance  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:42):**  crop performance with relatively limited regulatory oversight you put on the product  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  plant health improves it's a win-win but the moment you begin making claims to say that oh  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  you can put on this product for fusarium control all of a sudden that product needs to go through  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  an extensive registration process that is very expensive and becomes a lot more expensive for  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:05):**  growers to purchase the product and to apply it i'm using an organism as an example but the same  
**[0:42:10-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  is true of nutrients of manganese or copper for example you can get uh manganese bactericides or  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  copper bactericides like mannep and mancozeb and all these different compounds or you can use  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:24):**  manganese as a nutrient and actually get better results in many cases than you can with the  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  fungicide application because you get it inside the plant preventatively proactively and so there  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:35):**  is this difference in perspective of how we approach and manage and apply these products  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:42):**  and also how we talk about them that has regulatory consequences in in many of the  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:47):**  developed countries around the world and that's something that's very important for us to keep in  
**[0:42:51-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  mind is if we demand that products carry a label for disease control that we have an inoculant that  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  carries a label for disease control then that's what we're going to get at some point in time as  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  the industry develops and it'll probably come at a significant cost that wasn't really necessary  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  and that'll be the sad thing won't it because once it gets regulated big farmer will take over  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:16):**  and that's where the cost will go up and when once again farmers are being farmed aren't they  
**[0:43:19-0:43:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:19):**  to use your term job it's and it's that's the sad bit because it doesn't have to be expensive  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:26):**  you know farming is getting tighter and tighter we have got a growing population to feed and  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  we've got to get the job right so as we are regenerating and it's it's a tough one but it's  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  it'll be very sad if it all gets abused by a big farmer again and we're back to square one.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:43):**  Tim what do you see as the untapped potential many cases many times when i speak with growers  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  they often have these experiences or these observations where they see that there is a  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  certain opportunity in agriculture tremendous untapped opportunity and untapped potential  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:43:59):**  exists that many people are not aware of or not paying attention to what does that look like for  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:03):**  you i think at the moment john over here it would be carbon sequestration i see that as has been a  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  big market for us moving forward there's a group of us come together and we're calling ourselves  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  the green farm collective and we're going to trying to sell carbon on behalf of farmers and  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  the reason one main reason we've come together is we don't want farmers to be exploited again  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:25):**  in this market and unless we get together and do that it will be exploited we can sequent carbon  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:31):**  in the way we're farming i'm already net zero so i have got carbon to sell and i see that really  
**[0:44:37-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  has been a big potential for farming moving forward because the planet is being polluted  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  and if somebody wants to invest in my farm to stop some of that pollution and bring some of  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  that carbon back into the soil where it belongs i'm happy to to have an income from that and work  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  with those people to make that happen and by having that income then i've got more money to  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  spend on creating more biodiversity more capital green capital on the farm to be able to take that  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  forward and i see that really as a big there's only farmers really that can make that difference  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  on the planet and if we can have we should have an income for being paid for it it's not wrong to do  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  that i don't see really going forward when you consider the experiences that you've had on your  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:24):**  operation that you've shared very widely with many people particularly in the uk and you consider the  
**[0:45:29-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:29):**  opportunity that exists what do you perceive being the limiting factors that limit farmers from  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  moving forward what is limiting farmers themselves from achieving the potential that they're really  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:41):**  capable of it's always what's between their two ears john it's you can't rush people down this path  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  it's when i first started you know you shout you jump up and down and you want to tell everybody  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  and nobody listens and then you get really angry and frustrated because people aren't listening  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:45:58):**  and then you go through the stage where i'm not going to talk to anybody because nobody listens  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  anyway and then you come out the other side and you start to realize that when people need help  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:07):**  they pop up and i'm always more than happy to help you know quite often i'll be going up and  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:11):**  down the field and i'll be talking a farmer through a process just to help them and that's  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:16):**  the thing it's the more we can talk about it and the more we can get out there the more people will  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  start to take an interest and take a look at it but it's always what's between farmers two ears  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  that creates the biggest barriers because until it makes sense in their own head they won't do it and  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  they won't put it out there and it's just slowly slowly you can't rush people on their journey it's  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  their journey and it's not us to step in and say right you've got to be there by now it's all we  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  can do is coach and encourage and help them along that journey and it's it's a wonderful journey to  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  start and i love it when a farmer phones me up and they've heard me speak and they've gone home and  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  they've implemented something and they say tim it's fantastic it's worked really well that's the best  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  reward ever that is you know you can just you feel how pleased they are that it's made a jump on their  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  farm and they're taking it forward and yeah i just love phone calls like that on my own personal  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  journey the stuff that was between my ears that most hindered my own research development was  
**[0:47:18-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:18):**  it was not the stuff that i didn't know it was the stuff the information i was certain i knew  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  that was incorrect and the stuff that i learned historically from kind of the mainstream agronomy  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:31):**  approach i've uh one piece at a time it got chucked into the dustbin and until eventually  
**[0:47:36-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:36):**  there's almost nothing left i could so relate to that it is just starting from scratch but  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  it's just it's almost like being a newborn child and it's just that bewilderment of taking it all  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  in and questioning everything i question everything and once you start to question  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  everything you can pull it all apart and just take the bits that you want and that's that's  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:47:57):**  what i really love about the journey because we're unfolding so much new stuff that you know we were  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:02):**  told couldn't happen or wouldn't happen or you can't do that and that's the the fascinating bit  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  of the journey it's just seeing everything unfold and repair and move forward and it doesn't always  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  go right but then you learn to show up when it hasn't gone right it's it's taking the positives  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  out of every situation there's no point dwelling on the negative that's not going to make you feel  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  good or take you forward you've got to dwell on the positives and take that little bit there's  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:25):**  always a positive there you've just got to find it and learn from it and take it forward with this  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:31):**  pathway that you've been on of presenting and talking to farmers and sharing your own journey  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  what is something that you would like to speak more about but you're often hesitant because  
**[0:48:41-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  you sense people may not be ready to hear it yet oh that's a big one i'll be totally honest now  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  i'll probably get shot down for this later but i think it's it's the fact that everything is  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  connected we're connected to everything on the on this planet i think we're all one really the trees  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  the plants everything is we are so connected because everything is energy we're energy and  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  energy can neither be created or destroyed and i think that's the one i probably have never been  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  ballsy enough to talk about but i think we're all connected you know every plant every tree i think  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  we've all got that connection there and i think that's why it's so important to start and heal  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  the planet because it's the only way we're going to repair the damage and move forward and respect  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:24):**  everything that's on the planet if that makes sense yeah i think respecting it acknowledging it  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:29):**  i personally believe that the majority of the living organisms we work with  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  in fact i think i can safely say i believe that this is true for all of them they are all capable  
**[0:49:38-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  of making intelligent informed decisions whether that gives them sentience or not they certainly  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  seem to be self-aware they certainly seem to be aware of their environment this should give us  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  a newfound respect and appreciation for what's going on and when we also begin realizing the  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  incredible degree to which they communicate with each other and with all the other organisms in the  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:00):**  environment it is it's pretty remarkable i saw a cartoon a couple days ago or a couple weeks ago  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  that really cracked me up there were two trees with two people walking by and the one tree says  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:12):**  to the other do you suppose that those people can communicate with each other and the second tree  
**[0:50:18-0:50:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:18):**  says no how can they possibly they don't have roots oh yeah that's so true and it is it's it's  
**[0:50:31-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:31):**  uh it is we're all connected and there's been so many experiments done where you can train sort of  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  rats or something to do something and there'll be another island miles away and they learn it without  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:42):**  being learned it's just all out there in the big internet it's um it's just downloading it i know  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:48):**  you've heard of different composers and when they're coming up with a song and then somebody  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Episode_76_Tim_Parton_FINAL_AUDIO.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  the other side of the world will come up with a very similar song and if you've got your antenna
